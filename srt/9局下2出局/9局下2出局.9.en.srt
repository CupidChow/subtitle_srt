Jung Joo

3
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:10,553
Dad!

4
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,579
I'm Sorry.

5
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,164
I'm Sorry.

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,946
What?

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,390
Want to get married?

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,858
I actually wanted to tell you as soon as possible.

9
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:43,948
But she doesn’t look like a student.

10
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:45,898
Yes.

11
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:53,444
I was also shocked. I don’t know where should I start asking.

12
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:58,194
I want to marry her.

13
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:03,202
I know it is a little early, but only this way,
I can concentrate on playing baseball.

14
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,626
When I don't feel assured, I can’t do anything. So it has to be done this way.

15
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:08,185
You…

16
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:11,890
You're not going to US because of this lady?

17
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,337
Dad, it's not just because of this.

18
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:21,145
It's me.

19
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,985
I don’t wish to bet on it.

20
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:28,330
You said that you didn’t pass the test?

21
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:33,124
Oh heavens.

22
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:34,655
What is going on?

23
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:37,062
What exactly is going on?

24
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,870
Miss.

25
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,544
Mom, you can talk to me.

26
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:47,207
Talk to me, dad.
I'll answer it.

27
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:52,317
- Noona.
- Go back.

28
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:53,896
- Noona.
- Don’t come near me.

29
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,978
- It can only be done that way.
- It's not like that.

30
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,630
Noona.

31
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,830
You, how can you cause me such pain?

32
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,898
Don’t be like this.
It's not like that.

33
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:06,310
Go back.
Your parents are waiting.

34
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,762
How can I let you go back like this?

35
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:09,719
Go back.

36
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:14,481
Now, I… can’t face you.

37
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:25,615
Ok. Start.

38
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:30,623
Start.

39
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:35,091
I’ll do it myself.

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,861
You're not going to tell me?

41
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,451
Don’t say anything.

42
00:02:57,398 --> 00:03:00,548
After I have cooled down,

43
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,563
then, ask me again.

44
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:07,180
Ok. Your turn.

45
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,874
My turn?

46
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,085
This time it is sticking in this one.

47
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,197
You are dead.

48
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,370
Hey!, come here, come here!

49
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,616
Hey, come here!

50
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:31,556
Come here.
Scrunch up your nose.

51
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,786
Not going to stick it in?

52
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,525
I’m not playing.

53
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:47,339
From when you started dating,
he has already put in a lot of effort.

54
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,477
I never thought that he will be so stubborn.

55
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,739
I have treated him very cruelly before.

56
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:04,619
When Jung Joo was in a lot of pain.

57
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,337
That time, he just had finished an operation on his shoulder and was recuperating.

58
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:15,555
That day, he gave me a ball.

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,559
He says now he can pitch.

60
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,054
Says it was all my effort.

61
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:28,173
The moment I took the ball,

62
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:32,412
my heart was suddenly on fire.

63
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,220
Then tears started to pour out.

64
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:43,636
I was able to feel Jung Joo’s warm hands.

65
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:45,949
I wanted to say, “It was tiring on you.”

66
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,919
‘It was hard on you.’

67
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,805
Wanted to give him a hug.

68
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,820
But can I do that?

69
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,656
Of course not.

70
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,941
He and I.

71
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:08,897
Although I wish so much to do so. I still went secretly to see Jung Joo’s school’s match.

72
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:18,247
Wanted to go there secretly,
but I still dress up.

73
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,641
Do you remember?

74
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:29,742
After meeting 2 or 3 times,
both side parents met up.

75
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:33,679
Not asking about my opinion, they already decided on the wedding date, that guy.

76
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:38,978
Ah, the bald intern that hung his mobile phone at his belt loop.

77
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,118
Come to think of it, that was the time when you started dating Jung Joo.

78
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,212
The publishing company went bankrupt.

79
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:50,351
My work was not selected.

80
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:53,960
My future looks pitch dark.

81
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,658
Am I really going to get married like this?

82
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,245
I start to have wild thoughts.

83
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:03,218
That is also normal.

84
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:07,282
When I was in a dilemma,
I went to watch the match.

85
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:12,909
Because it's the finals,
the crowd was quite large.

86
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,543
That day,

87
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:34,981
I feel as if I’m at the center of the world.

88
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:44,307
Jung Joo, he, has always been good to me.

89
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:51,977
Why am I always the one in his life that is dragging behind?

90
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,492
So you really did not just laze around, seriously practicing.

91
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:30,278
Noona.

92
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:32,890
I have already told my parent’s clearly.

93
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,987
It’s alright.

94
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,184
Sign it.

95
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,493
Come on.. sign it.

96
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,428
Kim Jung Joo’s personally signed signature.

97
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:36,396
Next time, however expensive it is, I won’t sell it.

98
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,445
I am very grateful for your love.

99
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,598
The love you given me is all spilling out.

100
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:52,983
So the energy of love is enough for me to live out the rest of my life.

101
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,994
Until now, let’s …

102
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:03,655
let’s break up, Jung Joo.

103
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,332
Noona.

104
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,719
In the future, regardless of how you look when you see me,

105
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:17,277
no matter what happened,

106
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:19,729
I will not see you.

107
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:28,350
I… don't have the right to hold back your future.

108
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:34,792
Now, furthermore, I don't have the confidence to go on with a love that is not stable.

109
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:04,884
Sorry, all these times I keep thinking of leaving you.

110
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:10,012
Sorry, I didn't put in my whole heart to love you.

111
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,076
Just once.

112
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,602
Hold my hand, ok?

113
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,945
You must definitely become part of the Major League.

114
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:43,469
I believe you can do it.

115
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,457
I will become an old and lonely old woman soon.

116
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,586
During the festivals, I will have no place to go and no one will look for me.

117
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:40,816
Just order a bowl of black bean paste to settle a meal, that sorry of old granny.

118
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:44,403
Don’t you think it is very suitable dad?

119
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,898
Your dad won’t be able to rest in peace.

120
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,225
Dad. I don’t have any other way.

121
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,695
I keep thinking that I have threw away the last ticket in my hand.

122
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:57,188
What sort of person is he?
She has already become like this.

123
00:12:57,391 --> 00:13:00,171
She has always been like this.

124
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,224
What is it?

125
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:15,853
You'll find out later.

126
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:20,924
Hyung Tae.

127
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,378
What?

128
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,569
The truth and the wrong intuition.

129
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:29,106
The reality and imaginary. And getting poisoned.

130
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,531
What is the meaning?

131
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:36,482
At times I, will get the wrong feeling and treat you as a guy.

132
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,671
You being a man.

133
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:42,581
You don’t have any points that lose out to others.

134
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,031
Of course I'm not worse that others.

135
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:49,824
But us, did we compare which is better?

136
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,994
Raise your cup.

137
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,807
Congrats on your 5th time out of love.

138
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,398
It’s the 6th.

139
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:06,161
Is there another fellow that I don’t know?

140
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:09,322
There was a love that was top secret.

141
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:11,218
Cheers.

142
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:26,432
When you reach 40, and there is no one else at your side, then marry me.

143
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,186
Be careful, I will tell Ji Sun.

144
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,795
I am saying, if I don’t have anyone by my side too.

145
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,423
This is another empty promise* you're making, isn't it?
(*This is another joke you're playing on me, right?)

146
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:37,266
If it becomes a empty promise, then just let it be.

147
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,292
Jung Joo’s smell.

148
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,173
Hyung Tae.

149
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,874
Hmm?

150
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:54,122
Can I fall in love again?

151
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:59,055
I'm very curious about that too.

152
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:03,219
Bring along a very huge bouquet of flowers over.

153
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:06,859
I say when I am 40.

154
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:12,496
Really, when that time comes,
if we are still like now.

155
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:17,819
If I hold it, it will be able to cover your face.

156
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,452
A huge and heavy bouquet of flowers.

157
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,719
Come and propose to me.

158
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:30,076
The thing that I need most in the world is you.

159
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:33,963
The type of bouquet of flowers that makes me feel that way.

160
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:38,499
Flowers are so expensive, still want those?

161
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:41,293
If you don’t have the ability then forget it.

162
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:52,730
<i>Will I still able to meet others,</i>

163
00:15:52,953 --> 00:16:00,590
<i>and fall in love over again?</i>

164
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,221
So noisy, the fishes will swim off.

165
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,014
Hey fish!

166
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:07,863
Do you guys want to run off too?

167
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:11,148
Do you really want to leave my side?

168
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,511
<i>Undisclosed No. 1, Byun Hyung Tae</i>

169
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:52,070
<i>His playing career, from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996.</i>

170
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:53,219
<i>Track record.</i>

171
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:54,413
<i>Neighbors since birth.</i>

172
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,980
<i>Entered puberty later then others.</i>

173
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,818
<i>He, In kindergarten, always bullied and shy.</i>

174

<i>High school second year,</i>

175

<i>and a dream like body.</i>

177

<i>He became a candidate in her life.</i>

178
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:13,938

<i>9th Inning - The return of a player that backed out.</i>

You actually couldn’t even hit one.

226
00:20:57,511 --> 00:21:00,386
Hey! Why are you here?

227
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:02,193
I came near-by for some matters.

228
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:06,442
I was about to contact you.
Didn’t think that you were slacking here.

229
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,345
That’s great.
Let’s go eat.

230
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:11,806
Hold on.

231
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:13,710
I am not convinced.

232
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,150
I have to hit one.

233
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,356
Heard that you were dumped.

234
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,030
Nice.

235
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:39,984
You can do it right?

236
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:42,507
This time’s revenge is a little more.

237
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:45,900
The target is at the convenience stores advertisement products.

238
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,039
The importance is as huge as the actual advertisement.

239
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,520
Why?

240
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,860
That, think about it.

241
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,930
Just take a high class restaurant.

242
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:58,078
The taste of the wine is almost the same,
the prices are also similar.

243
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,590
And, those with high alcohol content can’t advertise.

244
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,853
Then, what will the consumer interest be focused on?

245
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:06,474
That’s right.

246
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:07,990
Can you display the cooler wines?

247
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,553
Won’t choose directly.

248
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:11,583
Majority of them will let it to the bar counters to decide.

249
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:16,673
Hence, the wine that the bartender promotes will have direct influence on the customer.

250
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:19,126
Oh, that is a possibility too.

251
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:21,928
So, the alcohol business grounds strategy is also another type.

252
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:25,165
The alcohol content is high, therefore, you can’t use it as advertisement.

253
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:27,504
Looks like I have never seen a wine advertisement before.

254
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:30,268
Of course you can’t use such thing as the television, a media that has so strong an influence.

255
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:32,518
That's the reason why the alcohol content for soju was lowered.

256
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,475
That has something to do with advertisements?

257
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,273
Not because of health issues?

258
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:39,447
Any liquor that has an alcohol content below 17 can be used for TV commercials.

259
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,450
Using health as a reason.

260
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,553
The advertisement leads on the consumers.

261
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:46,020
Have a feeling that I am tricked.

262
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:50,145
Tricked by the advertisement, that sort of feeling.

263
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,896
It is only a natural combination.

264
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:56,733
Businesses would manufacture products that are needed for the society through observations.

265
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,478
When we promote it to the consumer,

266
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:04,496
we will bring out the deepest needs of the consumers to them.

267
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:06,345
A need towards health.

268
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:09,109
A need towards a loved one.

269
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:11,786
At times, we give them a chance to change their lives.

270
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:14,592
An even provoking their shallow pride.

271
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:20,054
At times being the world’s most difficult friend, to console the opposite party.

272
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:22,016
Why?

273
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:27,460
You are really still very friendly.

274
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:31,414
Ah.. That is why Hyung Tae is able to attract so many girls.

275
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:32,736
Isn’t it so?

276
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:34,888
After capturing the girls desires, then getting closer.

277
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:36,849
Your job.

278
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,294
He is a natural.

279
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:40,901
Right!

280
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:41,912
Why?

281
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,564
You are also very skilled in this area too.
Don’t you have a girlfriend?

282
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:47,794
Dated a few times.

283
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,623
Looks like I can see the woman’s desires too easily.

284
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:56,403
When I was dating with you, it was like that too.

285
00:23:57,156 --> 00:24:00,593
What you really want.

286
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,108
Yes.

287
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:11,695
You are always the first to know before me, what I want. And you did it for me.

288
00:24:27,163 --> 00:24:28,610
Call back your glaze.

289
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,760
It's almost on fire.

290
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,376
Really didn’t say who sent it?

291
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,116
He said he didn’t know.

292
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:37,569
When did it come?

293
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,152
what hour, what minute, what second?

294
00:24:40,502 --> 00:24:42,380
Do not have baseless hopes.

295
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,298
Jung Joo oppa is now in the US.

296
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,968
You don't have to remember me word for word.

297
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:50,459
Then who can it be?

298
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:52,862
Most probably it is sent wrongly.

299
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,135
Get to work.

300
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,941
I think that this is good.

301
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,484
This..

302
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,627
I have no interest.

303
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:23,121
Really embarrassing.

304
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:25,561
Yes.

305
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,300
I'm not interested in that.

306
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:34,205
But if Jung Joo is in the US now,
does it mean that he left?

307
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:35,709
Really left?

308
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:37,726
Why are you asking this?

309
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,189
Now it has nothing to do with you right?

310
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,588
I think that this's not bad….

311
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:50,290
This, I said before.

312
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,251
Pick one?
Which is good?

313
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:56,301
End of this month.

314
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,900
He'll be formally going to the US.

315
00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:09,992
What is this?

316
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:11,945
cigarette commercial.

317
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,462
What is the content?

318
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:18,655
the idea is the change in a person’s life.

319
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:22,249
But the other commercials use it too much already.

320
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,106
Oh gosh.

321
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:28,339
Really can’t think of anything special. So frustrating.

322
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:45,143
Broke up?

323
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,707
Yes.

324
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,104
She must be so depressed.

325
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:55,566
So the date today is lunch?

326
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:56,731
What?

327
00:26:56,731 --> 00:27:00,825
A pretty girl, a lovable girl,
an intelligent girl, a sexy girl.

328
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:05,276
Placed beside one’s man,
which is more dangerous?

329
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:09,957
A sexy girl is too common,
so it's not the answer.

330
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:13,812
A girl that is out of love.

331
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:15,493
What?

332
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:18,531
This few days I will let you go off home earlier.

333
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:20,544
Just these few days.

334
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:33,453
Can’t you just use normal methods to over come it?

335
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,587
You're back?

336
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:40,480
What is this?

337
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,012
Ji Sun gave it to you.

338
00:27:42,012 --> 00:27:44,787
She says that sweet things are most effective for a person out of love.

339
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,537
She called.

340
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,107
Said she will introduce friends to me.

341
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:49,800
Ji Sun?

342
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,730
Shouldn’t have told her.

343
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,364
I am your friend hence she is worried for me.

344
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,140
How lovable.

345
00:27:57,351 --> 00:27:58,867
So?

346
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:03,050
I told her that I like someone who is like Son Suk Hee*. (*A Korean anchor)

347
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:07,381
I understand that it is that kid that has let you turn your attention to that area.

348
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:11,175
Think about it, living with a very elegant, perfect, intelligent person.

349
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:13,735
A lifeless soul like you.

350
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:17,568
Will be looked down on and be shredded into pieces with just one blow, you idiot!

351
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,489
Park Ji Sun is not bad too.

352
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:20,946
That.

353
00:28:21,374 --> 00:28:23,888
Just take it as you don’t want to know friends.

354
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,437
Next time I will not fall in love.

355
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,266
Tiring.

356
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:39,178
Do you want to drink.

357
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:41,118
I quit drinking.

358
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:42,282
Why?

359
00:28:42,282 --> 00:28:45,753
If I let go, I will tend to do the wrong thing.

360
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:51,465
I found an ink stone while cleaning the house.

361
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:55,514
I feel a lot more relaxed.

362
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,970
But you… have you eaten?

363
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,711
<i>Always so happy.</i>

364
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:04,284
<i>La la la, happily moving.</i>

365
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,904
<i>The cosmic youth.</i>

366
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:10,151
Hey! Can you don’t start singing out of a sudden?

367
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:11,517
I will be frightened to death by you.

368
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:14,236
<i>Strong and powerful being.</i>

369
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:17,403
<i>Iron people.</i>

370
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:33,659
Hello, special delivery.

371
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:47,140
Waiting for that kid?

372
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,063
No.

373
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,666
Even when he is back, how can we continue?

374
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,944
But.

375
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:57,510
But…

376
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,142
I dare not believe.

377
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:02,814
If…

378
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:09,413
He calls, Noona, going to appear soon in front of me.

379
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:24,196
Really.

380
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:27,200
Miss him so much.

381
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,028
I’m not drinking.

382
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,845
Only drink when I’m next to you.

383
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:46,814
Drink up.

384
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:51,186
If you go crazy, I’ll beat you so that you don’t make a mistake.

385
00:30:57,973 --> 00:30:59,536
It’s good.

386
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:02,708
This came for you.

387
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:05,639
What is it? Open it up.

388
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:16,850
It’s an album.

389
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,797
Album?

390
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:34,478
My album!

391
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:38,277
- You saw?
- I didn’t see it.

392
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:39,568
- Please forget it.
- I’m serious.

393
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:41,890
- Erase it completely from your mind.
- What is it anyway?

394
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,632
- You know!
- I’m telling you I didn’t see.

395
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:46,802
- Erase it from your head, quick!
- Alright.

396
00:31:46,802 --> 00:31:48,493
You saw!

397
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:51,725
Are you crazy?
What were you doing?

398
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,508
<i>I don’t like you~</i>

399
00:31:55,508 --> 00:31:57,618
<i>Let’s split up~</i>

400
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,299
Don’t sing.

401
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:01,424
Then how should I deal with this atmosphere?

402
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:03,353
Take off the mask, at least.

403
00:32:03,353 --> 00:32:06,858
In my head, the pictures and the mask…

404
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,391
Bravo~.

405
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:10,554
Do jokes come out in a situation like this?

406
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,113
If I don’t joke…

407
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:13,504
I’m about to go crazy.

408
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,613
What is your goal?

409
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:15,942
You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you?

410
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:17,130
Why are you like this?
what are you doing?

411
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,382
What do you mean what are you doing?

412
00:32:18,382 --> 00:32:20,774
What kind of act is this?

413
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:25,265
Chun Hee said to take it with her with Mi Kyung.

414
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:26,118
Three?

415
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:27,444
Three bravo~.

416
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:28,777
Don’t imagine things!

417
00:32:28,777 --> 00:32:29,662
It hurts, girl!

418
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:31,281
So you should’ve been careful!

419
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:34,599
No matter how close we are,
we are completely different in form.

420
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,230
How can you not be careful?

421
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,712
After I listen to you, you’re a really strange guy!

422
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:40,255
Why are you disgusting someone by leading the conversation a different way?

423
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:43,667
Do you know why two hamsters get babies if they’re in the same cage?

424
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,707
Do you think it’s because they love each other?

425
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:47,498
Why do hamsters come out here?
Are you crazy?

426
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,918
Then why did you move into the apartment in the first place?

427
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:51,473
It’s all because of you, you bad bastard.

428
00:32:51,473 --> 00:32:53,401
Really!

429
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:54,707
I’m going to sleep.

430
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,159
Let’s sleep.

431
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:57,214
Hey.

432
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:58,912
I’ll sleep. Sleep.

433
00:32:59,114 --> 00:33:01,285
Don’t overdo it.

434
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:03,833
What do you want me to do?

435
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,079
Hey! Why are you locking your door?

436
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,034
Shut up!

437
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:26,383
Good morning.

438
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:27,661
It’s so awkward.

439
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:36,109
Don't mind me and sit down.

440
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:42,164
The screaming man disappeared and returned as a turd.

441
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,310
Why? Did someone come yesterday?

442
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:46,614
You were acting so weird.

443
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,160
I thought i wouldn't be able to see you on my sixtieth birthday.

444
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:53,186
We are out of coffee. Buy some.

445
00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:54,861
Alright.

446
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:03,356
What?

447
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:05,537
Nothing.

448
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:25,682
<i>I'm attending my first conference presentation.</i>

449
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,535
<i>You must be nervous.</i>

450
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,676
<i>Tell me how I can be of help.</i>

451
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:37,534
<i>In the corner, quietly at the most.</i>

452
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:41,439
<i>Open up your parachute and sit down.</i>

453
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,675
<i>Prepare quickly, and don’t forget your resources.</i>

454
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,725
<i>The vice president came!</i>

455
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,599
Hey, I called out Ji Sun's name. Why are you answering to me?

456
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,307
Yes, I’ll call you back after I see the situation.

457
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:05,864
It’s kind of hectic after Lee Young Jae’s scandal.

458
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,316
You have all your resources?

459
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:09,045
Yes.

460
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:11,068
I’ll call you back.

461
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,735
-Don’t forget them.
-I’ll be back, Vice President.

462
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:14,970
Yeah, do well and come back.

463
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,681
Yes, sir.

464
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,994
What is it?

465
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:24,817
The agency kept calling to know how the shoot’s going.

466
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:26,198
Oh.

467
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:22,997
You drank all of this yourself?

468
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,582
That isn’t impressive.

469
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,894
You should’ve dissuaded him.
You just left him like that?

470
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,437
He said that he’ll send you on a vacation.

471
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:34,342
Are you alright?

472
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:38,894
Why does an athlete go and do that?
What if your body breaks down?

473
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:41,796
Why are you like this?
It makes my heart ache.

474
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:43,846
I want to go on a vacation with you.

475
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:47,744
Why wouldn’t you?
3 nights and 4 days.

476
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:49,671
I’m not going if even if I get picked.

477
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:51,549
What are you doing?

478
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,474
You should’ve thrown it away.
You drank all of it?

479
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:55,538
Are you stupid?

480
00:36:55,538 --> 00:36:58,086
When you get picked, buy me dinner.

481
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:00,568
I’m taking all of this Cola.

482
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:03,410
It’s you that made him drink all of it, right?

483
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:05,813
Are you alright?

484
00:37:05,813 --> 00:37:08,354
Let’s go and throw it all out.

485
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,993
He sure drank it well.

486
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:15,934
Are you alright?

487
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:21,347
Why did you drink all of it?

488
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,069
There was one left.

489
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:39,561
Hey! You just leave him to drink all of that, you bastard?

490
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:45,163
It’s good enough to drink.

491
00:38:21,413 --> 00:38:23,209
If I knew it’d turn out like this,

492
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:27,623
I should’ve went on a vacation with you at least once, Jung Joo.

493
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:30,290
If I knew it’d turn out like this,

494
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,960
I should’ve done everything you wanted to do.

495
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,924
Jung Joo…

496
00:38:56,765 --> 00:39:00,362
Don cry, Nan Hee.

497
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:05,007
Don’t cry.

498
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:58,491
Not yet?

499
00:39:58,751 --> 00:39:59,725
Yeah.

500
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:01,653
I came to look at the files.

501
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,121
By looking at you it looks like it will come out today.

502
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:08,870
Your makeup and outfit makes it look like its ready to come out.

503
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,562
If you pick cigarettes you go to hell but,

504
00:40:13,562 --> 00:40:16,444
if you choose non-smoking your life’s a rainbow. Right?

505
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,225
Yea that’s right.

506
00:40:18,455 --> 00:40:20,378
For example.

507
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:23,022
How is this?

508
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,155
There is a girl and a guy and they’re really closely related.

509
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:28,499
To date, there’s something missing,

510
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:31,500
but some sparks fly because they knew each other so long.

511
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,815
If it doesn’t relate, then I’m going to kill you.

512
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:38,669
Like the chances of a lighter without gas lighting up a fire.

513
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,062
You know those sparks that come and go?

514
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:45,058
But are these sparks accidental?

515
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:47,856
For example, they kiss because of a sudden emotion.

516
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:50,480
Or go across and date.

517
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:54,530
But the guy has a girlfriend who’s
10 times prettier than the girl.

518
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:56,587
So what happens?

519
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:02,550
He gets slapped and loses his best friend
and his girlfriend leaves him.

520
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,005
He was living a perfect life…

521
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:09,998
Why are you like that?

522
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:12,221
I was just joking.

523
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:18,949
I did that.

524
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:23,688
While being drunk...with a friend.

525
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:26,464
Vice President?

526
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:28,032
Is he my friend?

527
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:30,005
He’s my boyfriend.

528
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,353
The thing is, Hyung Tae.
You see, what happened is…

529
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:38,796
Listen to me.

530
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,109
I’m not listening!

531
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:41,820
Listen to me!

532
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:45,228
I think we need more image resources.

533
00:41:45,492 --> 00:41:48,559
Ji Sun, I think you’ll have to find more image resources.

534
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,113
Yes.

535
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:51,986
<i>Blind date?</i>

536
00:41:51,986 --> 00:41:54,146
<i>I think he’ll match well with Nan Hee.</i>

537
00:41:54,146 --> 00:41:56,259
<i>He’s a senior of mine who is an accountant.</i>

538
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:00,164
<i>Rather than that, I have a friend that I thought of.</i>

539
00:42:00,472 --> 00:42:03,279
<i>Your friend? Who?</i>

540
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,788
<i>I have a friend from the army.</i>

541
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:09,916
<i>Let’s meet at the Seoul Hotel Bar at 7 o’clock.</i>

542
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:13,338
<i>Alright.</i>

543
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:16,510
<i>And tell Nan Hee.</i>

544
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:19,009
<i>I have to go into an advertising meeting.</i>

545
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:20,880
<i>I will.</i>

546
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,175
<i>I’ll see you later.</i>

547
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:23,656
<i>Alright.</i>

548
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,192
<i>I love you.</i>

549
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,170
Vice President.

550
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,986
I'll get off work right after I stop by G-Motors.

551
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:04,547
You do that.

552
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,882
<i>I’ll see you at the Seoul Hotel Bar at 7 o’clock. I have something to say.</i>

553
00:43:24,263 --> 00:43:26,968
No, that’s not it.

554
00:43:28,212 --> 00:43:33,484
Alright, I’ll see you at the Seoul Hotel Bar at 7 o’clock.

555
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:35,026
Yes.

556
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:43,466
Why is She so stubborn?
I was going to get a hold of myself and get some work done.

557
00:43:44,281 --> 00:43:45,380
Hey!

558
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,773
I know that you’re Hyung Tae’s girlfriend.

559
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:51,012
I really have no interest in that arrangement.

560
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:55,420
She says it so cute and innocent
that I can’t just refuse bluntly.

561
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:58,112
Should I remove that?

562
00:43:58,448 --> 00:43:59,619
Why?

563
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,426
It’s still alive.

564
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,537
Where would you have come from?

565
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,989
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

566
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:17,618
The director at the SP headquarters has started
to contact agencies to set plans for public performances.

567
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:19,360
good I think it’s getting big.

568
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:23,557
They're going to create a team for the Asia market launching.

569
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:24,946
A show?

570
00:44:25,147 --> 00:44:26,437
A show and an advertisement?

571
00:44:26,677 --> 00:44:29,225
You could see it as an Asian agency.

572
00:44:29,457 --> 00:44:34,251
She's quite famous and this fellow runs
one of the best business organizations.

573
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,430
<i>This girl really…</i>

574
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,445
<i>Your determination to sell me off is stronger than I expected.</i>

575
00:44:50,661 --> 00:44:55,649
It’d be nice if you got along well with oppa’s friend,
so that we could hang around together.

576
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:57,880
It’s done.

577
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,771
Do you have something to be happy about?

578
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:04,078
Did he give you money?

579
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:10,196
Unni, oppa said that he loved me.

580
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,171
It makes me giggle.

581
00:45:22,216 --> 00:45:23,467
You two got caught square in the face.

582
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:25,283
I felt that it was suspicious.

583
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:27,573
You said that it wasn’t like that.

584
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:29,752
Shut up.

585
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:35,698
In return for keeping my mouth shut,
treat me and this woman through the full course.

586
00:45:37,061 --> 00:45:39,263
Why did you come out to do what?

587
00:45:39,263 --> 00:45:41,222
Look at your face.

588
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,613
You planned to meet a guy when you came out.

589
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,108
I should be the one who's most shocked right now.

590
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,977
I was taken back for a while too.

591
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,340
I can go, right?

592
00:45:55,595 --> 00:45:57,934
Where are you going?

593
00:45:58,203 --> 00:46:00,425
How can you do that?

594
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:02,786
Ji Sun.

595
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:05,396
What? You did something bad enough to get hit for.

596
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,125
Sit down.

597
00:46:09,374 --> 00:46:12,832
I’m so shocked and ashamed.

598
00:46:13,108 --> 00:46:15,704
Why are you crying over something like that?

599
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:19,240
Why are you overdoing it?

600
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,703
That rascal…

601
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:25,813
Hey, you were the ones that got your weaknesses caught.

602
00:46:26,227 --> 00:46:28,596
Isn’t it so stupid?

603
00:46:30,076 --> 00:46:32,913
What is this…?

604
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,533
I was really curious.

605
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:53,518
This woman’s voice over the phone was just killer.

606
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,085
Really?

607
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:57,121
Hello~?

608
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:58,780
Yeah, this.

609
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:01,067
Can you do it one more time?

610
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:03,853
Hello~?

611
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:10,024
So I asked him to let me meet you A LOT,

612
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,505
but he says that he can’t ever do that.

613
00:47:12,737 --> 00:47:13,774
Why did you do that?

614
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:17,814
Because I thought I would get flustered if I saw you in person.

615
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:21,494
You were probably flustered because it was more then you expected.

616
00:47:22,024 --> 00:47:25,171
How could you make such serious misunderstanding?

617
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,230
Your taste is very...

618
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:33,171
Hello?

619
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,031
Unni!

620
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:39,149
Can you whisper it to me this time?

621
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:41,605
You want me to press 060 for you?

622
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,431
<i>Hello?</i>

623
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:49,088
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

624
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:53,387
<i>The darkness,</i>

625
00:47:53,387 --> 00:47:57,433
<i>has already overspread into the night.</i>

626
00:47:58,636 --> 00:48:02,315
<i>Knocking on the window and answering to the moonlight.</i>

627
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:43,833
He’s not good news.

628
00:48:44,402 --> 00:48:47,077
It's probably your company's motto.

629
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:52,212
I’m telling you to be careful,
since you seemed to be enjoying it.

630
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:54,798
Stop drinking.

631
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:59,674
You said that I could drink as much
as I want as long as I’m next to you.

632
00:49:33,186 --> 00:49:34,531
Go in.

633
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:08,490
What are you doing?

634
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:11,157
Oh, you came?

635
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,643
Why did you ride the taxi by yourself? It’s dangerous.

636
00:50:17,012 --> 00:50:20,530
Why should I go on the road that you drop off Ji Sun?

637
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:23,337
So what?

638
00:50:25,872 --> 00:50:27,949
I’m coming home anyways.

639
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:30,823
Please, play by yourselves.

640
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:33,729
Ji Sun’s taking care of you because you catch her eye.

641
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:38,455
I know. And that’s why I went along up till now.

642
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,213
But don’t do it anymore.

643
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:42,484
It’s tiring.

644
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:01,671
<i>Yes, I've returned home safely.</i>

645
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:31,367
Hey, let’s go to the bath.

646
00:51:32,203 --> 00:51:34,629
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.

647
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:38,034
You changed your ring tone.

648
00:51:38,268 --> 00:51:40,262
Ji Sun changed it.

649
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:44,875
Go just the two of you to fish in the weekend.

650
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:46,772
Why?

651
00:51:46,772 --> 00:51:52,238
She's very excited about going fishing with you only, idiot!

652
00:51:55,856 --> 00:51:57,948
Let’s change a bit.

653
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,338
About me splitting me with Jun Mo.

654
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,876
If it wasn’t back when I was 20 and it was now,

655
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,652
don’t you think I would’ve made a different decision?

656
00:52:12,914 --> 00:52:14,263
You think so?

657
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:15,815
Yeah.

658
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:19,139
When I see my married friends,

659
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:24,811
well, I don’t mind Sang Hoon and Mi Kyung
because they’re both our friends,

660
00:52:25,067 --> 00:52:29,452
but, there aren’t any other friends
that I keep in touch with often.

661
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:35,448
Whenever we meet, we say, “I’m envious of you”,

662
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:38,187
your husband’s and your child is this and that,

663
00:52:38,187 --> 00:52:45,184
And those friends look at me and say that
they’re envious of my independent life.

664
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,427
But when we go back to our own ways,

665
00:52:49,693 --> 00:52:52,878
we don’t remember what we said to each other.

666
00:52:53,138 --> 00:52:56,577
The conversation’s hung up in thin air,

667
00:52:57,246 --> 00:53:00,546
like how the stomach gets full from drinking a lot of water.

668
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:03,086
and it seems like something’s missing.

669
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:07,775
Then something feels uncomfortable.

670
00:53:07,775 --> 00:53:10,087
Then we grow further apart.

671
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,294
We’re not to that extent,

672
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,935
The start’s good,

673
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:16,231
but on the second, it’s about money,

674
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:18,122
then the third it’s about women.

675
00:53:18,122 --> 00:53:20,561
When we depart, we say don’t get caught and be safe.

676
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:24,232
Fighting! And we encourage each other.

677
00:53:26,593 --> 00:53:30,715
I thought a lot starting from the strange meeting yesterday

678
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,780
all the way the time before I fell asleep,

679
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:39,191
but even among girlfriends it’s like that,
so what would it be like for us?

680
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:42,134
Seeing how you talk,

681
00:53:42,134 --> 00:53:44,549
I don’t think you’d even say hi when
we passed each other in the streets.

682
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:47,782
I heard some people do that to avoid misunderstandings.

683
00:53:49,197 --> 00:53:55,413
So if there’s even just once 1% chance that that
women will become part of your family,

684
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:59,186
concentrate more on her than me.

685
00:53:59,186 --> 00:54:01,269
I will do the same.

686
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:03,263
How disappointing.

687
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:10,185
How disappointing.

688
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:13,045
I felt the same way.

689
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,314
If I go fishing the first time Hong Nan isn’t there…

690
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,742
Enjoy this world as much as you can.

691
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:24,629
I feel like I’ve been dumped while I’ve been dating.

692
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:27,625
I’m not to that extent.

693
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,843
<i>Actually, my heart ached.</i>

694
00:54:35,074 --> 00:54:38,010
<i>I hated the girl that made me think like this,</i>

695
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:43,493
<i>and now that I imagine that, that
girl’s beside Hyung Tae, and not me,</i>

696
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:46,778
<i>a 30 year old jealousy aroused.</i>

697
00:54:46,778 --> 00:54:57,431
<i>I was sad that what seemed like a heavy
30 years could fly away like ear hair.</i>

698
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,761
Let’s think about it to see if that’s the answer.

699
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:48,229
Noona!

700
00:56:24,404 --> 00:56:26,419
You should’ve called before you came.

701
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:27,969
This is enough.

702
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:30,829
Why do you cook up a grand feast,
when it’s no one important?

703
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:32,462
There’s nothing to eat.

704
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:35,083
The sesame leaf is ripped very well, want to try it?

705
00:56:35,415 --> 00:56:36,996
Want to have a glass of soju?

706
00:56:36,996 --> 00:56:38,065
Alright.

707
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,908
Let’s do it.

708
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:57,184
It’s actually ok to live apart.

709
00:56:57,404 --> 00:56:58,946
You become my alcohol buddy.

710
00:56:58,946 --> 00:57:01,504
Be quiet.

711
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,552
Here.

712
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:13,225
You seem like you’ve been starving.

713
00:57:13,494 --> 00:57:15,943
How many times have you dated?

714
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:17,381
You ask such things.

715
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:19,762
Just for the heck of it.

716
00:57:20,032 --> 00:57:24,421
Tell me honestly. When was the last time you loved?

717
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,534
Just eat your food.

718
00:57:28,218 --> 00:57:30,038
When will you grow up?

719
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:32,890
I don’t know what maturity is,

720
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,773
so I’m not going to love anymore.

721
00:57:35,773 --> 00:57:38,078
If you don’t, are you going to live alone?

722
00:57:38,078 --> 00:57:40,733
I’ll go on blind dates and marry.

723
00:57:41,352 --> 00:57:44,434
It’d be better if I marry and love.

724
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,593
Dating is really hard.

725
00:57:55,452 --> 00:58:03,412
Back then, I’d be alright after a few days.

726
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:09,892
But this time is just too hard.

727
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:21,044
I feel like tears are coming up from the pain around my belly button.

728
00:58:22,872 --> 00:58:32,053
I feel like it’s coming up from the inside of my hot chest.

729
00:58:33,891 --> 00:58:38,245
I sit down in the middle of the streets, too.

730
00:58:41,828 --> 00:58:47,435
I’m getting scolded for not listening to you.

731
00:58:57,074 --> 00:59:00,351
If you pass by, I thought it’d be good luck.

732
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:03,608
You really did pass by.

733
00:59:16,038 --> 00:59:17,760
Why?

734
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,325
Mom.

735
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:23,824
Can you hug me once?

736
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:36,944
Don’t be uncomfortable.

737
00:59:37,763 --> 00:59:40,509
I came to say goodbye.

738
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,901
I'll leave tomorrow.

739
00:59:47,104 --> 00:59:54,969
I heard that you made him dinner
on the day he last visited here.

740
00:59:54,969 --> 01:00:00,106
He was starving, so what could I have done?

741
01:00:00,415 --> 01:00:03,003
Thank you, Mom.

742
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:37,016
<i>If you’re a baseball fan,
you’d remember this scene.</i>

743
01:00:37,016 --> 01:00:39,108
<i>Baseball player Kim Joo Wan who was severely injured
with 2 broken anklebones and 3 different ligament ruptures.</i>

744
01:00:39,108 --> 01:00:45,074
<i>He was called the baseball genius.
It was a painful moment of his professional baseball career.</i>

745
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:49,252
<i>But after three years, Kim Joo Wan broke the KBO record,</i>

746
01:00:49,252 --> 01:00:51,123
<i>and he became the prince of the ground field.</i>

747
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:53,989
<i>But right when he was about to enter into the Major Leagues in the year 2000, </i>

748
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:58,362
<i>he was diagnosed with a ruptured shoulder 
which led him to quit his baseball career.</i>

749
01:00:59,028 --> 01:01:00,751
<i>In the year 2003, hand and bones fracture</i>

750
01:01:01,093 --> 01:01:02,832
<i>In the year 2004, ruptured thigh tendon.</i>

751
01:01:03,086 --> 01:01:06,011
<i>Resting for one season, he had a ruptured knee in 2005.</i>

752
01:01:06,192 --> 01:01:12,176
<i>An unfortunate incident that led the baseball genius 
Kim Joo Wan with no other choice but to retire.</i>

753
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:17,840
<i>At the age of thirty, he is becoming the target of his fans.</i>

754
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:25,449
After you catch them, do you eat them as sashimi?

755
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:28,623
You don’t eat fish here as sashimi.

756
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,498
Then spicy fish soup?

757
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:31,946
Do you know how to cook it?

758
01:01:31,946 --> 01:01:33,871
Yeah.

759
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,735
Why?

760
01:01:39,101 --> 01:01:40,834
Nothing.

761
01:01:43,627 --> 01:01:45,550
What? Did you get bitten by mosquitoes?

762
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:49,763
Since a while ago, big mosquitoes kept attacking me.

763
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:52,424
You were bitten a lot.

764
01:01:52,645 --> 01:01:54,487
Hold on.

765
01:01:57,693 --> 01:02:00,850
I guess when we go fishing I shouldn't wear shorts.

766
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:03,556
I should have told you beforehand.

767
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:08,367
Aish.

768
01:02:08,367 --> 01:02:10,145
Why?

769
01:02:10,596 --> 01:02:11,484
It doesn’t turn on.

770
01:02:11,484 --> 01:02:13,692
I should go buy one.

771
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:17,761
Oh...it works!

772
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:33,783
Ji Sun.

773
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,672
I…

774
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:51,143
I think I shouldn’t have come here.

775
01:03:01,999 --> 01:03:10,281
I… think I like Nan Hee.

776
01:03:14,311 --> 01:03:17,575
<i>You’re asking me to date?</i>

777
01:03:17,872 --> 01:03:19,983
<i>Seeing that you love me,</i>

778
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:22,688
<i>as I kept watching you,</i>

779
01:03:23,092 --> 01:03:25,632
<i>I wanted to accept more,</i>

780
01:03:27,314 --> 01:03:30,233
<i>and I wanted to do more.</i>

781
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:33,247
<i>and I wanted to do more.</i>
