Brought to you by WITH S2
Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad

2
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:06,514
How many entries were there?

3
00:00:06,657 --> 00:00:08,623
About 1000 people.

4
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:10,713
Yah, it is not easy becoming a writer.

5
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:12,396
Mmh.

6
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:15,890
Hyung Tae, shall we go watch a movie
after we are done with dinner?

7
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:17,839
Ok.

8
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:30,267
What it this?

9
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:32,748
I have something I need to thank
these lady and gentleman for.

10
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,962
Thank them?

11
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:42,762
After that vacation, we got a baby.

12
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,416
Congratulations.

13
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:46,789
It's great. Congratulations.

14
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:48,455
All thanks to the both of you.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,760
Vacation?

16
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:55,168
Thank you for your champagne.
My heart felt congratulated.

17
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:57,776
But why are you thanking them for?

18
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:02,340
That time I told you,
we used them two for a bet.

19
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,838
If these two are really friends…

20
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:07,716
If we are really friends,
you will be able to get a baby.

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,683
It's not that.

22
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:10,333
You keep saying that we are lovers.

23
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,243
At the start you still said that we are homosexuals.

24
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:13,528
That is right.

25
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,903
Look.

26
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,842
Congratulations to you,
you have waited so long for it.

27
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:21,303
That's right.

28
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:24,363
After the vacation, both of you are fine?

29
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:26,810
Anyway, I want to thank the both of you.

30
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,617
Congratulations.

31
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:32,923
What are they doing?

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,993
Both of you went to a holiday together?

33
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,671
When both of us didn't have any partners.

34
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,713
Occasionally.

35
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,299
Even if we went, so what?

36
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:55,739
It's like you suddenly become someone who did something wrong.

37
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,771
How are you two like cohabitating?

38
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:00,270
Right.

39
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:01,994
Actually I am quite envious of you both.

40
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:04,900
I want to have friend that are like both of you.

41
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,020
Is it not?

42
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:08,339
You know each others in and outs
so you feel very comfortable.

43
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,006
You can say anything you like.

44
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:13,103
Have you seen them squabbling before?

45
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:15,051
Actually, I envy that the most.

46
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,435
They speak of each other without any reservations.

47
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:20,719
In my whole life, I never treated anyone like that.

48
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:22,201
Does that need to be said?

49
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:23,490
Who would be like that?

50
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:27,445
If you are angry you grab the other
person and scream out loud.

51
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:29,014
Or talk to the mirror by yourself.

52
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:30,561
Where it would it be like the both of you.

53
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:31,495
Right.

54
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:34,471
You can't be like lover and quarrel over love matters.

55
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:38,351
And you don't bother as to whether
the opposite party is frustrated.

56
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:42,947
After hearing you say that,

57
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:45,944
Looks like our relationship is something
to be envious about.

58
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,665
I frustrated you so much that you cared?

59
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:51,993
When we are dating, it's unavoidable to have times like that.

60
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,572
Don't pretend that you don't have it.

61
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:59,526
Let's become friends like them too.

62
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:03,249
Ok.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,944
If you want to be like that then take away the curtsies.

64
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,941
I heard you proposed.

65
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,648
Mmh.

66
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,180
Why are they still not coming out?

67
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:01,200
<i>Hyung Tae, quickly come out.</i>

68
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:20,579
Nan Hee.

69
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,026
Mmh?

70
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:28,451
Your relationship.

71
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,852
Looks like it's not just friends.

72
00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:39,088
The atmosphere in that house tells me.

73
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,884
Didn't you still say that you were envious
of our relationship just now?

74
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:44,420
I only am envious of your relationship as friends.

75
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,738
Then, you can continue to be envious.

76
00:04:54,844 --> 00:05:00,565
That day, why did that girl come in between our space?

77
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,488
Those eyes told me that.

78
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:06,212
You two are…

79
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:10,645
The man comes out from the shower.

80
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:15,162
The girl wearing home clothes
and just sitting around.

81
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:18,596
With addition of your allergies.

82
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,622
Whole heartedly everything is rejecting me.

83
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,306
You mean that you cannot shower at home?
You can't wear comfortable home clothes at home?

84
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:28,036
Although I am going to move out soon.

85
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,581
But I don't wish to say it to you.

86
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:38,787
Before you appeared, our relationship was already like that.

87
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,724
Till now, I don't need to ask for your understanding right?

88
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,502
If you are putting it this way,
I have nothing to say.

89
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:48,742
What is more, I owe you one.

90
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,019
Don't say such things to me in the future.

91
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:52,712
Tell that to Hyung Tae.

92
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:56,025
I can't do that.

93
00:05:56,692 --> 00:06:03,797
When I tell Hyung Tae that, I have
to be prepared to lose everything.

94
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,713
Because to Hyung Tae, it's the problem of choosing
one of us between the both of us.

95
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:15,086
What do you want me to do,
want me to sigh and act pitiful?

96
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,232
Not to act pitiful.

97
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:25,770
If that situation really appears,
who knows what decision Hyung Tae will make?

98
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,615
Might as well you really become a woman.

99
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,794
Have a competition with me.

100
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,480
You really know how to put sarcastic
remarks on a woman's pride.

101
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:41,625
If you are entering in just as a friend,
I would be very unsettled.

102
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:44,636
If you are entering as a woman,
I have confident.

103
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,413
Really too much.

104
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:50,318
Come here.

105
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,830
Come on.

106
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,694
Fooling around.

107
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,804
Isn't she Yoon Sung Ah?

108
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,334
Looks like someone recognize you.

109
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:20,411
You have to be careful in the hotel.

110
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,494
Why does that matter?

111
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:24,299
I am just a unnoticeable working class person.

112
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,719
I can not take scandals.

113
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,267
What do you mean by that?

114
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:28,716
Better be careful.

115
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:29,987
Such a good friend.

116
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:31,798
I only manage to get to know such
an oppa through many connections.

117
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,880
Do you want me to say that?

118
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,047
See you.
Many connections oppa.

119
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:44,715
Mmh.

120
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:09,213
I should think about it some more.

121
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:12,128
You put it so seriously.

122
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,491
The essay has also ended.

123
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,677
I will consider it careful.

124
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:18,501
Go and have a good rest first.

125
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,481
You must be tired too.

126
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:23,292
If you are preparing to move,
you are going to be busy.

127
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:24,522
Maybe.

128
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:26,834
Whenever you think of me,
feel free to contact me.

129
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,388
You should open up your heart
and contact me too.

130
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:33,801
After I have given it some thought
and I am prepared, I will tell you.

131
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:37,685
Maybe, I need a very long time to think it through.

132
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,709
Thank you.

133
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:43,756
Did I come too early?

134
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,692
- Did you drive here?
- Mmh.

135
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,334
Then I'll be going.

136
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:48,367
Be careful.

137
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:49,962
Go on.

138
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,384
Let's go.

139
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,131
Where did you park the car?

140
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,742
I didn't drive here, sent it for repairs.

141
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,544
Then why not take Jun Mo's car?

142
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,983
I don't want. Looks like I am the light bulb.

143
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,696
What is wrong with you two?
It's not to that stage yet.

144
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:13,803
Then, in the future will it reach that stage?

145
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:17,609
I want to give it some serious thought.

146
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,021
Jun Mo and me.

147
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:22,892
What relationship the both of us can have.

148
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,222
Let's go.
I will fill in your emptiness.

149
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:28,188
Ok.

150
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,818
Just this little gathering, it's not enough to fill in my emptiness.

151
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:41,971
What if I don't get selected?

152
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:45,686
The essays are as high as a mountain.

153
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:49,930
I am afraid that the staffs are not
careful and miss out my essay.

154
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:54,617
Those that walk behind will step and trample on it.

155
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,602
After that it will just become waste paper
and vanish, what shall I do?

156
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,802
What are you thinking about Miss Hong?

157
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:05,834
Drink slowly.

158
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:10,564
Today, I must drink to my heart's content, let myself go.

159
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,724
Then just let go.

160
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,279
After that throw yourself into the waste pile.

161
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,150
Yah, just now, if we were exposed,
then we would be done for sure.

162
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:23,713
The situation will become more complicated that's all.

163
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,488
Irritating.

164
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:29,308
That is your true feelings, understand?

165
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:34,372
In order not to let Sung Ah know,
you looked into your inner self.

166
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:38,046
Even if it is, how can you understand me so well?

167
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:41,832
Again, again, there you go.

168
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,413
Quick drink up.

169
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,932
You are still sober.

170
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:54,385
I say, nowadays our conversation are too superficial.

171
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,414
Anyway, you're already in a relationship.

172
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:01,415
Next time, let's just have a very relaxed conversation.

173
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,080
Thinking about it carefully,

174
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:09,313
each of us have our own partners,
our relationship will be more relaxed, is it not?

175
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:12,025
Ok, let's hear it.

176
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,212
In the mobile phone, there wouldn't be,

177
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,670
That's great. Absolute baby. Good work.

178
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,131
That sort of messages coming in.

179
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,446
Thinking of that makes me empty.

180
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:29,613
No sudden situations.

181
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:33,182
My life has become empty.

182
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,201
Is it?

183
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:42,202
After the little rascal left, in 2 months,
there aren't any sudden situations?

184
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,359
Your turn.

185
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,553
Ok.

186
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,028
You are asking me to talk about Sung Ah right?

187
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,860
Mmh.

188
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,231
We have 3 years of blanks between us.

189
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,935
That blank is very mysterious.

190
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:01,483
It can be felt in the skin ship.

191
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:05,210
Not only when hugging.

192
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:06,767
Especially when we are kissing.

193
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:10,790
- Here, can we have another bottle of soju?
- Ok.

194
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:15,711
What were you saying?

195
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,628
What exactly do you want to hear?

196
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:27,096
When you start over with Sung AH,
what did you feel?

197
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,020
You really want to know?

198
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,158
Mmh.

199
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:34,855
This is my life.

200
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:43,153
There was actually such a huge chuck of meat cut off.

201
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:48,948
But I feel that has been filled.

202
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:56,798
But, I don't know if I can take it.

203
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,743
Truthfully speaking, I am quite worried.

204
00:12:58,835 --> 00:12:59,713
Why?

205
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:02,812
The status gap is too huge.
Very huge.

206
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:04,554
You still care about that?

207
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:08,735
Sometimes, you think too highly of me.

208
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:12,651
Me, I thought that I am the only one who
feels the feeling of being dwarfed.

209
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:14,037
How are you dwarfed?

210
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:15,730
You still need to ask?

211
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:19,991
I am much worse off then you.

212
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:23,881
I love to hear words like that.

213
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:25,300
You…

214
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,025
Drink up, drink up. Come.

215
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,372
Congratulations that you have a proposal.

216
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,407
Cheers.

217
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,197
Drinking soju at this time of the year,
the feeling is great.

218
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,261
Can't be drunk.

219
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,314
This is a good sign.

220
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:51,317
Yes.

221
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:53,257
You must definitely get chosen.

222
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:54,984
This is too much.

223
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:58,618
This girl is going crazy soon,
don't you know how to pity her?

224
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,666
Really?

225
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:08,853
From the start it was just a simple trip.

226
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:12,731
Raining on the outside, my mood is just normal.

227
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,201
Until now, I still feel that my hands are itching.

228
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,199
After I endured so many nights,
I have no intention of sleeping.

229
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:19,100
Really.

230
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,776
Talk with me through the night?

231
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,550
No problem.

232
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,441
You...

233
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,746
If you sleep off first like the previous time,
you will get it from me.

234
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,693
Of course.

235
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,693
With Miss Hong Nan Hee,
how can I afford to sleep off?

236
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:56,595
Hold the shovel, the shovel.

237
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:00,818
How can a fish-shaped bun hold a shovel?
What are you saying?

238
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,872
What are you saying?

239
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:17,741
So I am begging you,
wear your shoes, shoes.

240
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:23,320
Talking in your sleep, really…

241
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,395
Next time, sleep on the bed.

242
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:42,639
You worked hard, Miss Hong Nan Hee.

243
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:59,826
<i>Although this is my room but it feels unfamiliar.</i>

244
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,871
<i>This room has already long become Nan Hee's.</i>

245
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:22,867
<i>Every corner, there are Nan Hee's footprints.</i>

246
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,460
<i>Every corner, there is Nan Hee's scent.</i>

247
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:34,143
<i>This house is not the house of 5 months ago.</i>

248
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:37,207
<i>The atmosphere is different.</i>

249
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:58,397
You worked hard too.

250
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,212
Did you sleep well.

251
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,891
Yeah.

252
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:44,964
My back aches.

253
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:48,027
You actually slept two days.

254
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,134
What?

255
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:58,621
After father passed away,
there isn't any man in the house.

256
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,793
So it's like this?

257
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,579
Seeing you shave, there is a mysterious sense of security.

258
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:18,608
<i>This space still remembers every thing
that we chatted these days.</i>

259
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:24,222
<i>Even if Nan Hee moves out,
I will be fine right?</i>

260
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:26,070
Had a good dream?

261
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:29,322
I saw a white snake in my dream.

262
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,257
White snake?

263
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:33,573
What is the meaning?

264
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:36,886
You finished writing the essay and you
actually had a dream of pregnancy?

265
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,271
Pregnancy?

266
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,928
Of course, it is a very famous fetus dream.

267
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:46,264
<i>This year's 26th Korea's professional
baseball competition is starting.</i>

268
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,620
<i>Today is the day of Korea's 26 years of baseball history.
This event was held at a stadium in Dong Dae Mun plaza.</i>

269
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:52,604
<i>Not only was the 70's high school baseball held here.</i>

270
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:54,547
<i>This stadium was a famous place in the 1970's
where all high school baseball games were held. </i>

271
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,598
<i>The big match between famous baseball players Sung Dong Ryul
and Park Yoo Joon was also held at this stadium.</i>

272
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,935
<i>This place has recorded the stars famous finale battle.</i>

273
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:01,373
<i>The question about Nan Dae Mun
baseball field to be demolished,</i>

274
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,950
<i>There were talks about getting rid of the stadium, </i>

275
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,208
<i>but today, the city of Seoul and baseball leagues
have finally reached an agreement to keep the stadium. </i>

276
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,417
<i>This issue has been resolved and will disappear through history.</i>

277
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:08,349
<i>The countless famous battles evidence will be gone today.</i>

278
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:11,340
-14th inning-

279
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:17,262
-the lush green grass still remembers your story-

280
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,734
That room won't do.
That area is not safe.

281
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,785
And it's too far from your mom's place.

282
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:27,151
Just say it, it's too far from your place.

283
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,021
<i>I am saying…</i>

284
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,348
That place one of the best.

285
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:33,706
You only looked at a few and you said yes.

286
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,203
Anxious, but really…

287
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,080
Don't be so anxious.

288
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:39,875
Careful you might fall into a trap.

289
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
Look for one slowly.
No one is chasing you out.

290
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:44,887
But I really feel the excitement.

291
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:50,980
When I think that I can be independent soon,
I think that I am just great.

292
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,949
No matter what house I look at, I feel excited.

293
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:55,239
Look.

294
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:58,197
You are really an easy prey for tricksters.

295
00:19:58,328 --> 00:19:59,927
I know.

296
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:01,106
Cool down.

297
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:02,403
Be careful.

298
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:05,985
Yah, it's not lunch time,
how come you are out looking at houses?

299
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:11,421
I came out to meet up with a writer,
so I saw the houses on the way.

300
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:15,484
Yah, Writer Sung Woo contacted me.

301
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:20,392
Oh..The author that made me feels so depressed.

302
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,522
That's right.

303
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:25,623
I can't wait.

304
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:28,169
Don't know what sort of person he is.

305
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,250
Me.

306
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,577
I want to be a little more thicked-skin and ask for his signature.

307
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,607
What is there to be ashamed of?

308
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:34,536
That person will…

309
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:36,551
Hello.

310
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:43,249
Yah, hanging up.

311
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:45,190
Yah.

312
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:46,629
Yah?

313
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:49,986
What's that?

314
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:54,774
The price is cheap, clean, airy, and the sunshine is enough, 
why are you looking for that sort of house?

315
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:55,620
What?

316
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,213
Did you not advertise in the company's website?

317
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,200
Nan Hee unni is moving out?

318
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:01,340
Oh.

319
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,776
Nan Hee?
Who is Nan Hee?

320
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,215
Ah, the very quick-witted friend I saw?

321
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:08,690
Too slow-witted. So she is a little boring.

322
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:11,134
In your eyes it is so.

323
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:15,258
Unni, without you, she will survive better.

324
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:18,509
Where are you going?

325
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:21,878
Says she is going to meet a guy.

326
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:23,204
Oh.

327
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:25,874
There is a meeting at 2 pm,
both of you didn't forget right?

328
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:28,307
I will go prepare.

329
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,465
See you later.

330
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,555
Looks very bright.
That parachute.

331
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,053
How can she not be bright?

332
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,466
I am a player.

333
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:44,060
What?

334
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:47,423
Heard that she is meeting a guy,
you can't bear it?

335
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:50,086
All the male sex is the same.

336
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:52,164
Don't use male sexes as an excuse.

337
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,508
It's your own problem.

338
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:56,714
Let's go.

339
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,959
I want to put all the male sexes' capabilities into work.

340
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:03,128
No way.

341
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:07,577
With your capability, you will become a director very soon.

342
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:16,661
What?

343
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:19,682
I am Sung Woo.

344
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:21,861
Why?

345
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:26,535
That… what are you asking?
I don't know how to answer.

346
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,486
It's not that….

347
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:32,164
Why?

348
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:36,164
Ah, the pen name.

349
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:37,555
It's that?

350
00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:40,780
You are only curious about that right?

351
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:44,853
I am not satisfied with my own name.

352
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:50,247
Recently, I saw a girl with the name Ma Bong Chun.

353
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,206
Recently, I watched a lot of television.

354
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:59,496
There was a great master who saw me.

355
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,462
That great master gave me my name.

356
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,610
So Hun.

357
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:08,451
<i>Why does it have to be you?</i>

358
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:11,654
so regretful, Nan Hee.

359
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:18,265
I though that when you saw my novel,
you will recognize that it was me.

360
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,030
The past,

361
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:24,399
My love,

362
00:23:25,302 --> 00:23:27,608
It is all written in there.

363
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:33,957
<i>That beautiful story, how can it be 
written by a person like you?</i>

364
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:39,405
Between us, there is a never ending similarity right?

365
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:45,347
After I got your phone call,
I was extremely happy.

366
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,833
And ran here.

367
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,465
<i>The essay that made my heart thump non-stop 
when I read it time and time again.</i>

368
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:05,276
<i>Now I still remember the shimmering sentences.</i>

369
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:09,952
<i>The essay that made me so envious that 
I was shaking all over, how could it…</i>

370
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,934
<i>How could it be written by someone like you?</i>

371
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,391
You haven't changed much.

372
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,364
So pretty.

373
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,262
Firstly, think of how to advertise it in the country.

374
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:32,466
Yoon Sung Ah is very famous.

375
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:35,302
Think of more good ideas to earn money.

376
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:37,893
You want to put the focus on the concert 
that is directed at the public?

377
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:39,115
What do you think?

378
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:40,154
She has been a model before,

379
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,989
so everyone should be familiar with who she is right?

380
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:44,524
They are also not musicians.

381
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:47,787
Via the advertisements it must be aimed at the public.

382
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,867
Or hold a high class concert.

383
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:51,581
Choose one from the two plans.

384
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:54,306
If a high class concert was to be held,

385
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:56,106
the music industry would already have held it.

386
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:58,690
Just call in all those who can play 
to have a concert, wouldn't it do?

387
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,983
You are doing things in a slipshod way.

388
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:03,216
Because they wanted something new,
hence they approach an agency.

389
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,844
Why must you make yourself difficult?

390
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,525
Just catch hold of a point and then hit on that point.

391
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:12,068
But, a company without the experience of holding a concert,

392
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,774
why do we have to enter this sort of competition.

393
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,673
The committee director wants to come in for the meeting.

394
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,796
What?

395
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:22,672
This is not a huge event.

396
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:25,360
Our company's President is a music fan.

397
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:26,702
The director has a different plan.

398
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:31,205
So he requested from the director 
to handle the case personally.

399
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:32,847
Really?

400
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:37,022
Your news is too back-dated.

401
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:42,477
The news that I am getting married, did you hear it?

402
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:49,052
It's a joke.

403
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:55,619
What's so important that you're looking for me so urgently?

404
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:56,513
It's a secret.

405
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:58,713
Okay, I'm here.

406
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:04,242
Oh, you're here.

407
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:09,802
How do you do?

408
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:12,011
Come and sit down here.

409
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,117
Yes.

410
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,535
We were just chatting,

411
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,473
and I told the President that I had a friend working in his company.

412
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:27,317
He asked me to ask you out.

413
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,236
Here.

414
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,592
Your name is Byun Hyung Tae?

415
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:36,801
Yes.

416
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,669
Very please to meet you.

417
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:41,806
Come, let's have a toast.

418
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,856
That time he helped me before.

419
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,991
To thank him, I invited him to a meal.

420
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:55,010
He's very cheerful and very gentlemanly.

421
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:57,590
So I became friends with him.

422
00:26:58,145 --> 00:26:59,737
Look at how nervous you are.

423
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,773
He's the President of my company!
How could I not be nervous?

424
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,340
But you meet him quite frequently, don't you?

425
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,090
My company isn't a stall by the street, you know?

426
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:11,158
You don't have any sense of reality at all, do you?

427
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:14,119
The whole company has over 120,000 employees.

428
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,602
For a group leader who sits in a random corner 
to get a chance to speak with the President.

429
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:17,865
It's very rare.

430
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,250
You mean this is the first time you've seen him?

431
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:21,534
I've seen him on the news.

432
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:24,415
Hey, Group Leader Byun

433
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,927
Yes. Yes.

434
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,251
You seem very manly to me today.

435
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:38,493
Byun Hyung Tae, an extremely nervous person of society.

436
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,356
Very sexy.

437
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:17,646
<i>Jun Mo</i>

438
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:47,134
By doing this, you can really forget everything?

439
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:49,250
Just a blank mind?

440
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,443
Yah, you make people really curious.

441
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,101
Let's talk after we finish making the chair.

442
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:57,217
Why are we making a chair?

443
00:28:57,524 --> 00:29:02,778
I want to create something that I can show off to the world.

444
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,902
Is that part of your desire to create?

445
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:07,679
Or part of your yearning to have a child?

446
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:10,915
Are you sure you don't need my help?

447
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,649
Don't worry.

448
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:14,765
Should I make a chair too?

449
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:17,974
Just a moment… let me finish this first.

450
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:00,364
This is not bad.

451
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,332
A natural-born talent.

452
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:04,522
Is it something that you can't stand?

453
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,250
Yes.

454
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,153
I get jealous when I see a well-written composition,

455
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:10,920
Then I feel admiration.

456
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:15,043
Later, I buy that author's book the moment it is published.

457
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,687
That's my process.

458
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,636
But I felt really angry today.

459
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:25,679
Then again, today wasn't the first time I got angry.

460
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:29,014
Not long ago, I read a book that was really good.

461
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:33,567
But the author is 5 years my junior.

462
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,379
“What have I been doing all this time?”

463
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:43,144
“Now even people who're younger 
than I am are becoming authors.”

464
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,283
These thoughts were in my mind.

465
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,164
Could you be feeling that other compositions are good

466
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,302
because you're almost done with your manuscript?

467
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,863
Honestly,

468
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:54,600
I don't…

469
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:59,755
Have any talent.

470
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,432
I know that.

471
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:06,059
But…

472
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:09,488
I really like writing books.

473
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:12,901
I can't keep myself from writing.

474
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:18,395
Even when I'm just sitting down
I start thinking of it.

475
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,559
Is it true…

476
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,328
That plain hard work is not enough?

477
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:31,015
Are you tired of it?

478
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:34,984
I'm not very sure myself.

479
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:40,024
During this time when I haven't been around,

480
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:44,270
After Seung Hwan left, didn't you guys talk about this?

481
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:49,252
That you would live out the youth that Seung Hwan missed out on.

482
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:53,040
With even more vigor, with more energy.

483
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,870
Because there was someone who didn't 
even get the chance to do so.

484
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,825
If you're really sick of it,

485
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:05,364
Throw in the energy on Seung Hwan's behalf.

486
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,742
Only give up after that.

487
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:12,895
Your answer is really…

488
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,616
As complete as this chair.

489
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:21,597
Of all the furniture in the house,
I like chairs the most.

490
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:25,716
When I can't take it anymore,
and I need to rest

491
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,164
I just sit down

492
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:31,116
And it's like I get recharged.

493
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:36,145
Hmm… it seems like that.

494
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:16,237
But…What is this?

495
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:20,293
Ah.. I'm looking for a house.

496
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:58,186
What is this?

497
00:33:58,258 --> 00:34:00,108
A charger.

498
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:01,855
What are you recharging?

499
00:34:01,949 --> 00:34:03,467
Ya!

500
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,820
Ya…

501
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:12,393
It isn't a big sum, so why are you using a calculator?

502
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:14,254
Just calculate it mentally.

503
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,633
What are you trying to say?
Walking around here and there.

504
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,166
You're making me dizzy.

505
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:21,896
I met my company's president today.

506
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:22,901
President?

507
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:23,896
What president?

508
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,909
The president of my company!

509
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,270
- President, Lee Jae Young?
- Yes.

510
00:34:28,336 --> 00:34:29,621
What was the matter?

511
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,020
Did you have a presentation?

512
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,542
We drank wine together.

513
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:34,977
Are you lying to me?

514
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,677
It seems that he's a friend of Sung Ah's.

515
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:39,803
Oh, bravo.

516
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:41,300
What do you think?

517
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,770
What do you mean?

518
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,630
Not just about Lee Jae Young being my president

519
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:47,251
But about how Sung Ah's friends 
are of a totally different class than you are.

520
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,176
Why do you have to keep involving me in this?

521
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:51,894
It's because Sung Ah's friend is Lee Jae Young

522
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:53,498
But my friend is you.

523
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,988
Ah… you're really…

524
00:34:55,147 --> 00:34:57,706
Everybody's stepping on me today.

525
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:01,684
The house you're hoping to buy is 
the same price as her bathtub.

526
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:04,250
What do you think of that?

527
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:06,849
My life is too dry.

528
00:35:07,056 --> 00:35:10,279
Which is why I think your troubles are too rich.

529
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:14,068
Let's see…

530
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:21,250
When did you manage to get so much information?

531
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:24,310
I put it together whenever I had free time.

532
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,180
There isn't much to calculate.

533
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,816
My hands were both empty when I started living here.

534
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,390
That might be the reason. 
Even buying furniture is going to cost quite a bit.

535
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,256
But what is this figure? 450?

536
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:36,721
That's the pay that is owed to me.

537
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:40,949
My company isn't doing well, 
so I've only been getting 70% of my salary.

538
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:41,920
Ask your company for the money.

539
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:44,067
I know how badly the company is doing,
how could I ask for the money?

540
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:45,998
Are you mad? Then what are you going to do?

541
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:48,062
You haven't even gotten your commission, have you?

542
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:50,881
We only receive the royalties after 3 months,
I thought that would be the time…

543
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:56,222
Yah. Do you know what the biggest trap employees 
of small companies fall for is?

544
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,604
Thinking that the company is theirs,

545
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,282
Taking a step back when the company is in trouble.

546
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:04,818
That's what gives small companies the strength to survive.

547
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:06,151
Look!

548
00:36:06,253 --> 00:36:10,273
That's why your boss doesn't think anything of your salary.

549
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,390
There really have been a lot of emergency expenditures

550
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:14,416
With everyone is stuck in the same space

551
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:18,422
It's difficult to pull a long face and ask 
your boss for your money, right?

552
00:36:18,671 --> 00:36:20,491
Of course it's difficult.

553
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:23,573
Do you think your company will collapse
 if you ask for the money that's owed to you?

554
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:25,238
It won't.

555
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,516
I'm not saying that your boss is bad.

556
00:36:27,673 --> 00:36:32,705
It's just that not paying your salary in full has 
become a habit of hers unintentionally.

557
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,144
Look at the people around you.

558
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:35,834
It might be like that at the beginning,

559
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:39,678
and in the future, employees might even have to 
come up with money from their own pockets.

560
00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:42,145
If you continue like this,

561
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:44,063
You'll never be able to live on your own.

562
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:45,302
Don't scare me.

563
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,465
It isn't even a very stable job.

564
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,607
If it goes bankrupt, what will happen?

565
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:52,296
Move back home again?

566
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:59,496
There's something you have to do now that's even 
more important than looking for a house.

567
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,463
You need to ask for the salary that's owed to you.

568
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,691
- You're here.
- Good morning!

569
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,549
Good morning.

570
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,234
Boss, you seem very happy.

571
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:16,513
Oh yes, I'm great.

572
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:23,663
What's this?

573
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:25,895
This is the salary that you owed me.

574
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:30,945
And this is the commission that you owed me,
based on the sales of Author Shin's book.

575
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:35,186
What is this? Are you planning to quit?

576
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:38,320
What would I live on if I quit?

577
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:39,747
Then…

578
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:43,174
I'm looking for a house to buy,
but I don't have enough money.

579
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,273
I don't have any money now.

580
00:37:45,457 --> 00:37:50,096
Even if you don't, please keep in mind 
that you owe me this amount.

581
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:52,289
I understand.

582
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:53,805
I'll give it to you once I receive the royalties.

583
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,045
Please give it to me now.

584
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:59,480
You can come up with this amount of money, can't you?

585
00:38:03,505 --> 00:38:08,373
The salary you owed me has built u
p over the year to this much,

586
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:12,687
With the sales right now, you should know 
how much you'll receive in royalties.

587
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:16,155
You'll definitely receive the money in 3 months.

588
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,988
What's wrong with you today?

589
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:20,618
You let me take a break while I was writing my manuscript.

590
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:25,135
I'm very thankful to you for many things.

591
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:30,204
But I can't accept that paying me only a portion 
of my salary every month has become a habit.

592
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,971
That's a whole other problem.

593
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:37,316
Every time you receive royalties, our salaries 
should be the first on your expenditure list.

594
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,402
Ms Hong!

595
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:40,905
Please help me with this.

596
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,873
Just choose one.

597
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:50,605
Chinese food? Crabs?

598
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,942
Or tenderloin?

599
00:38:56,558 --> 00:38:57,556
What?

600
00:38:57,729 --> 00:38:59,250
Chicken?

601
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:05,855
You wanted to eat something delicious, 
and you choose chicken?

602
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,206
Yah… Summer, chicken, beer…

603
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:13,382
Isn't this better than even expensive fish?

604
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,532
I had a craving for chicken, but I couldn't 
bear to order it near my house.

605
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:24,846
A vision of this spring chicken kept appearing in front of me.

606
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,751
Spring chicken?

607
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:28,362
Jun Mo,

608
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:31,202
Am I a very big busybody?

609
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:32,236
No.

610
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,159
That's right.

611
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:39,571
Someone who's making your heart 
move has appeared, right?

612
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,109
No!

613
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,294
It's fine, you can go back now.

614
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:47,924
Just keep walking.
I'll send you to the door.

615
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:51,029
Really? Then just give me a moment.

616
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,465
I'm going to buy some tofu.

617
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,566
Okay.

618
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:13,191
Spring chicken.

619
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,971
Two of them?

620
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:17,787
Are you sleepy?

621
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:26,920
Hello.

622
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:28,986
Hello.

623
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:33,518
Hello.

624
00:40:34,238 --> 00:40:35,654
Hello.

625
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:45,234
Do you have a manager in your 
company named Jung Jun Ho?

626
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,226
Yes, there is.

627
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:50,423
We used to work together in a construction company.

628
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,302
He's a very meticulous person.

629
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,378
Oh, you worked in Shin Shin Construction?

630
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,586
They're one of our clients.

631
00:40:57,551 --> 00:40:59,379
I heard that he did very well in the past.

632
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:03,023
He was the fastest to be promoted, 
and also the fastest to retire.

633
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,379
Oh right,

634
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:07,660
Ms Hong did something big at the office today.

635
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,055
Really?

636
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:11,905
Oh, he's working at Nan Hee's company.

637
00:41:12,775 --> 00:41:13,695
This is a secret.

638
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:14,861
Why?

639
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,729
Oh, you're all Hong Nan Hee's friends?

640
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:23,050
I thought he was your boyfriend.

641
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,249
That's right, he is my boyfriend.

642
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:26,890
Right?

643
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:39,228
Chun Hee,

644
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,597
Yes?

645
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,349
I really think that you have the right to live a happy life.

646
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:47,865
I think so too.

647
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,339
Don't worry.

648
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:52,448
I can't help but worry.

649
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,124
Jun Mo,

650
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:57,838
What's the quality that has made us friends?

651
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,116
The fact that both of us couldn't go to university?

652
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,053
That was why we grew closer, right?

653
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,010
That could be it.

654
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:05,833
We were in the same boat.

655
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:12,397
I think he won't want to bring his little 
chicks out for walks any longer.

656
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,086
I'll tell you just this one thing.

657
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,958
The last time,

658
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:22,262
When you told me to try and fall in love with someone,

659
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:26,926
I thought of that person's face.

660
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:31,548
That really gave me a shock.

661
00:42:32,162 --> 00:42:34,244
Give me your hand.

662
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:37,952
I'll share a little warmth with you.

663
00:42:50,642 --> 00:42:52,365
You're here?

664
00:42:53,506 --> 00:42:56,251
What is this, really?

665
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:59,143
I found a place.

666
00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:01,487
Where?

667
00:43:02,128 --> 00:43:03,799
Why did you make the decision alone?

668
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:06,074
I was afraid I'd miss the chance if I hesitated.

669
00:43:06,281 --> 00:43:08,671
You say you're afraid of missing 
out every time you view a house.

670
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:10,995
You say that every house we view is bad.

671
00:43:11,123 --> 00:43:12,564
The contract? Have you signed it?

672
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:13,513
Yes.

673
00:43:13,731 --> 00:43:15,827
I've even made the deposit.

674
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:20,756
This feels great.

675
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:54,302
Fine, I understand.

676
00:44:19,105 --> 00:44:20,978
This looks okay.

677
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,939
It's not bad, right?

678
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:24,533
It's not too good either.

679
00:44:24,726 --> 00:44:29,282
If I had to find a place that pleased you,
I'd never move out in this lifetime.

680
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:33,260
At least you won't have to paint the walls.

681
00:44:33,427 --> 00:44:36,349
Right. I didn't want to waste money.

682
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:37,562
Money is scary, isn't it?

683
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:42,818
Yes. It leaks out so quickly.

684
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:46,241
Is this the south?

685
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:47,390
Yep.

686
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,943
Aren't I smart to be able to find a house 
that faces the south at this price?

687
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,444
What is this?
Is that a school field?

688
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,194
I knew it.

689
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,795
Why?

690
00:44:57,593 --> 00:45:00,305
Do you know how irritating the whistling 
is when gym class is being held?

691
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:02,715
I won't be at home when there's whistling!

692
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:05,716
I could even go out for exercise once in awhile. It's good.

693
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,430
Change the window.

694
00:45:09,646 --> 00:45:11,458
Why? It's still in good condition.

695
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:14,023
This is the third floor isn't it?
This isn't double-layered glass.

696
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:16,499
It's too easy for someone to break in.

697
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:17,699
Really?

698
00:45:17,855 --> 00:45:20,111
I'll change it for you, as a gift.

699
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:22,573
I won't stand on the ceremony, then.

700
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:30,634
You won't be scared living alone?

701
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,555
This bowl is so pretty. Let's buy three.

702
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:20,740
Who would buy odd number of bowls? Buy them evenly.

703
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,530
Should I buy a small fridge?

704
00:46:43,897 --> 00:46:45,109
<i>Fridge</i>

705
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:48,413
<i>Bed</i>

706
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,168
<i>Heater</i>

707
00:47:04,677 --> 00:47:07,433
Mom, it's me.
Happy birthday!

708
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:12,184
It's your 58th birthday, and the present 
you're hoping for is hair dye?

709
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,652
Do you have money?

710
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:17,542
Remember to apply everything evenly.

711
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:19,236
Okay.

712
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,532
Did you write well?

713
00:47:21,684 --> 00:47:23,558
I don't know.

714
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:26,591
You keep saying that you don't know.
So why are you continuing to write?

715
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:29,768
Mom, I'm moving house.

716
00:47:29,894 --> 00:47:32,464
Why? Where to?

717
00:47:32,672 --> 00:47:33,814
Don't move, Mom.

718
00:47:33,965 --> 00:47:35,552
What are you up to again?

719
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,003
It's a good thing.
I spend too much on living expenses.

720
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,283
The landlord wants to increase the rent 
after returning from his holiday.

721
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:47,266
That's why I asked why you were 
staying in such a big house all alone.

722
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:50,538
Why didn't you discuss this with me?
Where are you moving to?

723
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:53,674
It isn't far.
It's only three bus-stops from here.

724
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:55,952
I'll bring you there once I'm all set up.

725
00:47:56,181 --> 00:47:58,297
Did your company not pay you?

726
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:00,437
I've even received the salary they owed me previously.

727
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:02,295
That's good.

728
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:03,816
Mom,

729
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:06,886
Are you so worried about me?

730
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:09,963
Am I really that worrisome?

731
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:14,317
If it's too tough,
Move back home to live,

732
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,032
Mom, do you have any dreams?

733
00:48:20,281 --> 00:48:24,443
You're already 30 and you're asking 
your mother a question like this?

734
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:26,011
Could I not worry?

735
00:48:26,188 --> 00:48:29,881
Okay, I know. Don't turn around,
you'll get dye on your face.

736
00:48:33,512 --> 00:48:35,170
Mom,

737
00:48:37,675 --> 00:48:38,825
I'm sorry.

738
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:41,197
For everything.

739
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,744
I'm just putting everything in order.
I'm almost done.

740
00:49:49,914 --> 00:49:52,070
<i>Didn't I say I'd help out?</i>

741
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,632
Its okay, I wanted to do this alone.

742
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,803
Right… Did you tell your Mom about this?

743
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,937
Yes, yesterday.

744
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:02,133
<i>She didn't say anything?</i>

745
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,736
I just felt guilty

746
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:06,374
I feel so bad that I've been lying to her about living with you.

747
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,122
We've pulled this off for so long without being found out.

748
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,496
Shouldn't you be grateful to me?

749
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:13,306
Of course I'm grateful.

750
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:20,266
Come back early, I'll be waiting with dinner prepared.

751
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:30,003
Say it again.

752
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:31,916
<i>What?</i>

753
00:50:32,274 --> 00:50:34,316
What you just said.

754
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:41,034
Come back early today, I'll be waiting with dinner prepared.

755
00:50:42,365 --> 00:50:44,537
What's up with you?

756
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:51,127
This is the last time I'll ever hear this from you.

757
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,232
Today.

758
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,276
What's all this?

759
00:52:46,905 --> 00:52:48,951
My gesture of thanks.

760
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:52,901
Let's eat.

761
00:53:24,187 --> 00:53:26,070
Has the baseball match ended?

762
00:53:26,438 --> 00:53:29,843
Of course it ended.
Just look at the time.

763
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:34,907
I'll just leave the plants here.

764
00:53:35,198 --> 00:53:37,981
There's more than enough sunlight there.

765
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,020
Okay.

766
00:53:40,669 --> 00:53:42,370
Don't let them die.

767
00:53:43,675 --> 00:53:45,382
Okay.

768
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,668
Hyung Tae…

769
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,527
Yes?

770
00:53:57,999 --> 00:54:01,071
Though many things have happened,

771
00:54:02,718 --> 00:54:04,535
I…

772
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:10,068
Am very grateful for the chance to have lived with you.

773
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:14,562
Yeah.

774
00:54:15,938 --> 00:54:18,817
I thought I'd have many things to say.

775
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,772
But now I don't really have anything to say.

776
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,679
Will you be able to live well?

777
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:07,071
I'm a little afraid.

778
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:10,447
It's very different from how I felt when I first moved here.

779
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:15,316
Because it was your house,
so I wasn't worried.

780
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,667
Do you want me to send you there?

781
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:26,517
No, it's okay.

782
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,730
Call me if you ever need anything, at anytime.

783
00:55:39,095 --> 00:55:41,257
Always be careful.

784
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:42,830
Especially,

785
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:45,577
Be wary of people.

786
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,592
Okay.

787
00:55:54,214 --> 00:55:56,096
I'm leaving.

788
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:33,938
<i>I wanted to tell you yesterday,</i>

789
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:37,611
<i>But I couldn't, so I'm writing this letter to you.</i>

790
00:57:37,992 --> 00:57:42,773
<i>I moved into this house in the Spring of 2007</i>

791
00:57:43,486 --> 00:57:48,044
<i>I didn't have the face to stay with Yun Hee and her husband</i>

792
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:52,407
<i>My life was in such a terrible state.</i>

793
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:57,350
<i>Everyday my mother would nag at me,
I was so terrified.</i>

794
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:03,874
<i>I was terrified of turning into the person that 
my mother was talking about day by day.</i>

795
00:58:04,352 --> 00:58:06,069
<i>At that moment,</i>

796
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:07,948
<i>Just for 10 minutes</i>

797
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:11,812
<i>I needed a place I could live in peace.</i>

798
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:13,819
<i>Even if it was for 10 minutes.</i>

799
00:58:13,974 --> 00:58:18,282
<i>I needed a place I could love myself.</i>

800
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,936
<i>But ever since moving into this house</i>

801
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:22,934
<i>It hasn't been just 10 minutes,</i>

802
00:58:23,091 --> 00:58:27,062
<i>But for the whole day, you've been there listening to me talk.</i>

803
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,036
<i>When I reach home upset,</i>

804
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,776
<i>You're there by my side to make me feel better.</i>

805
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:34,208
<i>So,</i>

806
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:40,524
<i>Even if things didn't get better,
I had hope in my heart.</i>

807
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:44,804
<i>Now, even if I'm tired of what's happening,
I have the strength to stand up.</i>

808
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:48,828
<i>If the road is blocked, I have the heart to find another road.</i>

809
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:53,263
<i>All these things appeared when I lived with you.</i>

810
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,002
<i>Thank you.</i>

811
00:58:55,249 --> 00:58:56,902
<i>Hyung Tae.</i>

812
01:00:23,342 --> 01:00:24,889
Have you eaten?

813
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:26,299
Hyung Tae,

814
01:00:26,533 --> 01:00:29,276
I've only moved out for 10 hours.

815
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,156
If it's time to eat, you should eat.
What's that got to do with anything else?

816
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:34,370
I'll eat when I go home.

817
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:35,930
Oh my,

818
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:38,608
I need to build a relationship with the house.

819
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,009
You haven't knocked off?

820
01:00:40,188 --> 01:00:42,064
I'm going to.

821
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:45,597
Of all days, I had to finish my work early today.

822
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:54,280
Come over.

823
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:55,850
Go have fun with Sung Ah.

824
01:00:56,076 --> 01:00:58,568
She's got an appointment.

825
01:00:58,878 --> 01:01:00,981
That's what I told you.

826
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,325
Are you at home safely?

827
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:25,432
What's up? Don't you have an appointment?

828
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:32,237
What's going on?

829
01:01:32,407 --> 01:01:35,046
I was afraid you'd feel empty, so I came over.

830
01:01:48,929 --> 01:01:51,580
You can use the bedroom now, right?

831
01:01:53,178 --> 01:01:55,071
That's right.

832
01:01:55,376 --> 01:01:58,247
It feels empty, maybe because everything's been moved out.

833
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,486
Why don't you move your stuff over?

834
01:02:00,688 --> 01:02:02,793
Why, so quickly…?

835
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:05,220
Come outside and have a beer.

836
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,523
Okay.

837
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:12,200
Why did you do such a big load of laundry?

838
01:02:12,785 --> 01:02:14,588
Oh, that?

839
01:02:15,174 --> 01:02:16,782
Wanna watch a movie?

840
01:02:16,824 --> 01:02:18,188
I'll bring in the laundry for you.

841
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,773
No, how could I let you do that?

842
01:02:19,938 --> 01:02:21,952
Let's watch a movie.

843
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:53,756
Why?

844
01:03:54,356 --> 01:03:56,227
Nothing.
