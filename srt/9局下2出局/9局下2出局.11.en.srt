00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:15,340
Nan Hee?

3
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:29,065
So early in the morning, where did she go?

4
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,895
What is it? She doesn't want to see me?

5
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:40,031
Last time she never made breakfast,
why is she preparing breakfast nowadays?

6
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:47,416
This table which is filled with sincerity
is making people go crazy.

7
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:50,517
What does she want?

8
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,738
Where is her laptop?

9
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:58,031
This girl, is she planning on getting
ready to move house bit by bit?

10
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,311
He said if we wanted to remain friends forever,

11
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,412
We cannot have any monetary issues
between us nor have any love relationship.

12
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:12,911
He said it himself, why is
he breaking the rules now? Why?

13
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:17,348
You are becoming more
and more sensitive by the day.

14
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:19,931
Yesterday is not the same as today.

15
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,480
Not the least bit comfortable at home.

16
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:26,772
Lucky it is the last day of the leave,
I can finally breathe now.

17
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:29,441
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

18
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,169
Because our eyes keep meeting.

19
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:35,291
Because you keep staring,
that is why your eyes keep meeting.

20
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,173
Unknowing I feel that,

21
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:41,174
The house has a man, a man, a man.

22
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,138
I am going crazy.

23
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:51,075
I always thought that
your friendship was unbreakable.

24
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:56,248
Because of that few days, the friendship of
30 years is on the verge of going down the drain.

25
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,113
I can't do anything, anything.

26
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:02,607
Friendship that is on the verge
of going down the drain.

27
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:06,114
Is it that your heart is on
the verge of being beaten?

28
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,829
Frustrating.

29
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,956
Then forget it.

30
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,035
I only want to return to the past.

31
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:39,941
When our friendship was still
happy, peaceful and healthy, those days.

32
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:44,418
Really wish to return to those days.

33
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,518
Really wish to return to those days.

34
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:56,343
11th Inning> On the 15th of every month,
there will be a civil defense exercise.

35
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,659
Heard that you caught a phoenix.

36
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:26,466
What phoenix?

37
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:27,736
Stop pretending.

38
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,717
The whole complex knows it, you rascal.

39
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,931
From the basement eatery team
to the 18th floor office.

40
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,931
Everyone is spreading it, rascal.

41
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,391
What rumor is spreading?

42
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:36,392
Hey!

43
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:41,887
Her looks are good.
The family background is good too.

44
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:43,020
Mr. Byun.

45
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:45,020
Mr. Byun, congratulations.

46
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:47,020
They know too?

47
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,209
This is...

48
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,470
You rascal.

49
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:54,325
You actually manage to
get Ji Sun into your hands.

50
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,680
Are you crazy?

51
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,436
It's not that.

52
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:11,808
I only mentioned it to Hyun Joon.

53
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,797
What is that anyway?
You have to thank me.

54
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:17,534
Actually there are lots of people
that wanted to woo Ji Sun.

55
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:19,718
Take this chance to solidify your relationship.

56
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,718
This is making me crazy.

57
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:22,992
Where is Ji Sun?

58
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,001
Really a pity, pity.

59
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:30,930
I have to tell Ji Sun your
history of making friends.

60
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:33,588
It is not like this.

61
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,377
Really sorry.

62
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,603
How can such thing happen?

63
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:53,967
How was your break?

64
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:57,506
Bravo.

65
00:04:57,545 --> 00:04:59,015
You must be really happy.

66
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:13,872
Did you see it? Did you see?

67
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,387
- Really great.
- Really great.

68
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:22,963
I am really happy I can share
his beauty with you both.

69
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,707
Oh my.

70
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,107
Your breathing has been adjusted really well.

71
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,709
The time when you were holding me,
it was better a little.

72
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:37,378
Please come again tomorrow too, Mother.

73
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:40,999
Of course.

74
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,814
See you.

75
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,718
Let's go back and eat instant noodles.

76
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:53,224
My stomach is a little hungry.

77
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:58,670
Hey, did he just call her Mother?

78
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,622
Didn't she hear it?

79
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:16,589
Looks really delicious.

80
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,342
Who is she?

81
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,884
Why? If I say it, will you know who she is?

82
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,284
You...

83
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,958
Really pretty.

84
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,804
She sings nicely too.

85
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:30,451
Dances not too bad.

86
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:31,559
Isn't it?

87
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:35,058
Heard that her boyfriend is very rich too,
he is a 2nd generation heir.

88
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,058
Really?

89
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:40,764
Lacking nothing.

90
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:44,806
Really wish she could be a bit unluckier.

91
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:46,931
Unni.

92
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,660
Eat up, eat up.

93
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,937
I don't want to go swimming anymore.

94
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,473
That's right. Such a waste of time.

95
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:04,770
Moreover, with your figure,
if you don't exercise, you look great too.

96
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,220
That's right.

97
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,289
That coach looks ordinary too.
His figure looks ordinary too.

98
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,358
That's right.

99
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:12,610
Nowadays, there are tones that look like him.

100
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:14,121
That's right.

101
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,892
Is your holiday good?

102
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:21,207
It is just normal.

103
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,584
We did not meet for the last two days.

104
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,584
Now you are suddenly asking this.

105
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:33,204
Suddenly I am more interested in what
happens around me rather that my own life.

106
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,718
Did Nan Hee cook this?

107
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:46,718
Yes. Why?

108
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,701
You went to bed with a guy did you?

109
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:52,653
What did you say?

110
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,984
Are you crazy? What are you saying now?

111
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,429
The instant noodles are not the same.

112
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:01,401
My goodness, you're accusing me for nothing!

113
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,733
What is with you?

114
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:04,972
Quick eat up unni, eat up fast.

115
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,999
If it is not, then forget it.

116
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:30,486
If going by the law,
have they made a move yet?

117
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,082
Have they filed a lawsuit?

118
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:37,116
No. Looks like they haven't.

119
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,600
What is the meaning?

120
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:40,967
They said they are going according to the law.

121
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:46,159
But they want to take a little money
from our company? Is it like that?

122
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,648
I am not too sure too.

123
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:52,893
Afraid that the situation will get worst.
So I did not ask directly.

124
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:54,769
Give me their contact information.

125
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,298
Oh that... Director.

126
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,730
I will go take a look tomorrow.

127
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,389
I am afraid you can't settle it.

128
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,631
I cannot report it to the superiors,
and it is not solved.

129
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,078
I am like sitting on a bed of needles.

130
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,567
I promise to get them to forgive me.

131
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:11,835
So...

132
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,296
Until the weekend, give me some time.

133
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,952
And..

134
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:22,079
If I manage to solve the problem,
let me continue working, okay?

135
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,337
I am begging you.

136
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,261
<i>Me too. My face doesn't break out as much.</i>

137
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:32,914
<i>The texture is very good.</i>

138
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:35,305
<i>I prefer the texture of silk.</i>

139
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,560
<i>Now it is the well being era.</i>

140
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,690
I am right, aren't I?

141
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:53,860
Yes, yes, we are dating.

142
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,771
I'm very sorry to be telling you all these.
Didn't we break up already?

143
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:13,879
During the fishing trip.
Didn't I express myself clearly?

144
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:17,955
That's right. We broke up.

145
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,878
But what are you doing now?

146
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,489
Wish to get back at you.

147
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,785
The news really travel fast.

148
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:33,787
Drive the car, drive.

149
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,892
I am very scary, aren't I?

150
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:39,892
A bit.

151
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:46,417
I will admit being made a fool by you,
in any case, I was in the wrong.

152
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:51,289
But, what is the result of the prank?

153
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:55,179
Whatever the case, I won't let you go.

154
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:59,366
The news only state that we are dating.

155
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:02,738
But it was an event that brought us
from different teams together.

156
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,738
It is too helpful to us.

157
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,596
It's not an advertisement agency,
it's more of a match-making agency.

158
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,539
Ji Sun.

159
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,776
Have you succeed?

160
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:19,900
What?

161
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:22,704
Did Nan Hee unni say that she like you too?

162
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,704
It has nothing to do with that.

163
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,346
Look, you are so uptight. It was a joke.

164
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,438
When I say I'll let you go, you heave
a sign of relief. Really makes me angry.

165
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:39,964
Ji Sun.

166
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,502
Really sorry.

167
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:45,159
From the start, till now for everything.

168
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:50,359
Go and yell at the lobby of
the office 10 times, I am a bad person.

169
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,954
And it must be the time
when it is the busiest.

170
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,954
Office hours.

171
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:57,064
If it's in the afternoon, it will better.

172
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:59,064
Then I will forgive you.

173
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,829
Can you just let me off?

174
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:07,587
The rumor had to happen on the day
that you started your leave.

175
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:11,992
Before I could be released of the clutches,
the rumor had started spreading so quickly.

176
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,594
I thought, don't bother about it,
wait for you to return to pick up the mess.

177
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,271
It was very hard on you, wasn't it?

178
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,513
I want to curse you.

179
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,172
Not to let you suffer again.

180
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,966
I will clear up the mess soon.

181
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:46,836
I will get off here.

182
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:50,004
Didn't you park the car at the office?
Almost reaching, why are you...

183
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:53,147
Our team has to work over time,
I am to buy supper back.

184
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,147
I will wait for you.

185
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:59,937
Next time, don't treat me so well.

186
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,025
Okay.

187
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,193
We'll be leaving first, see you.

188
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:08,638
Thank you.

189
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,347
Aren't you going for the gathering?

190
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,678
Over time.

191
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:19,505
Because of a date, you are pushing it off, right?

192
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,505
Can you not talk about it anymore?

193
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,253
I am going, see you.

194
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:24,649
Where are you going?

195
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:25,834
Isn't your team going to have over time?

196
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,531
What did you say?

197
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,211
Who said that? Rascal.

198
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,571
The words are not printed clearly.

199
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:46,954
The color is also different
from the sample. Right?

200
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,677
Just because of something like this,
you want to use a machine?

201
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,753
Of course.

202
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:55,090
Isn't looking at the sample because of this?
It is not that I have nothing to do.

203
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:56,974
Aren't you too much?

204
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,573
Not giving any money.

205
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,871
And you have so many requests.

206
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,871
We will pay you the next time.

207
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:04,551
You can have a look at other printing companies.

208
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:07,809
Your company has a bad reputation
and everyone is afraid of taking orders.

209
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,816
We have always been very grateful to you.

210
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:11,816
Really.

211
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,650
Please help us do it.

212
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,376
I really hold this book in high regard.

213
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,717
Boss.

214
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:22,353
Go back to rest.

215
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,460
I will send the sample back for you to see.

216
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:27,381
What I have is time.

217
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:29,414
Looking at it here, it is so pretty.

218
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,974
Why is it that when it's printed out,
it does not look good?

219
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,198
If not, let's do it like this.

220
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:46,054
Since you are doing it,
can you use this method.

221
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,282
I just saw it on the magazine.

222
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,282
Here. How is it?

223
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,219
Ah! That bad girl.

224
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:59,160
Don't even bother to give a call.

225
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,343
<i>You...</i>

226
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,343
<i>Your legs are pretty.</i>

227
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:59,822
- You are here.
- Yes.

228
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,702
Why? Aren't you going
to sit at your old spot?

229
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,380
Don't wish to eat alone.

230
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:06,064
Want a drink?

231
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,407
Give me some noodles.

232
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:11,146
Right. Heard that you went for a holiday?

233
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,146
How did you know?

234
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,460
What are you doing?

235
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:50,738
Looks like that there's no one inside.

236
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,738
Oh? Is it?

237
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,128
You.

238
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,541
You seeing if I am home, right?

239
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:09,361
No.

240
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:14,285
Afraid to be with me?

241
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,285
No, I am not.

242
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:17,693
You, really...

243
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,084
I am not an imbecile.

244
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,795
How can there still be a person like you.

245
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,625
Let me change first before you start.

246
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,043
I was starting to feel very stifling.
Why are you back so late every night?

247
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,670
I have work to do, so I am back late.

248
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:32,804
Eating at the roadside store
after work is also considered work?

249
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:36,791
That's right. Truthfully speaking,
I feel very uneasy.

250
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,495
I don't wish to express it out,
afraid that you will suffer. But...

251
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,707
- It's already expressed too clearly.
- I'm making an effort too.

252
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:42,318
What are you making an effort for?
What does this counts as to?

253
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,705
How can you be so nonchalant?

254
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:45,311
So what if I am nonchalant?

255
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,387
In my life, there are more than
two women that have passed me by.

256
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:50,452
Bottling them all in my heart,
how can I even live? Don't you know me?

257
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,028
Didn't you say you don't want
to be a girlfriend, just friends?

258
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,328
I have already recovered,
why are you still like this?

259
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,982
Yes, you are so cool.

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,871
Really so amazing, so suave, bravo.

261
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,207
Now I have totally no interest
in you, so trust me.

262
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,119
I know.

263
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:06,535
I will even acknowledge you as a male.

264
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:09,579
What did you say?

265
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,244
What?

266
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,745
Why did she suddenly put an
effort on her toe nails, this girl.

267
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,745
Makes people unable to understand her.

268
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:44,885
So embarrassing.

269
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,954
Wait for me.

270
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:02,785
Let's run together.

271
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:04,131
Why?

272
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,995
Why do you look so surprised?
Did we not use to run together the last time?

273
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:08,364
Let's go.

274
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:47,509
Hey, why didn't you open it for me?

275
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,431
Being a girlfriend and a friend,
the treatment is indeed different.

276
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,192
So.

277
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:55,963
I am an impartial guy.

278
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:58,380
You are great...

279
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,784
If that holiday, that guy
wasn't you but someone else.

280
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,494
I definitely will have a lot
to say to you now.

281
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,595
Anyway, it was a very special experience.

282
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,365
I can't complain to you.

283
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,905
Hence, my actions are a little awkward.
Just be more understanding.

284
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,905
Me too.

285
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:32,575
To be dump by you, so I have
none to complain about.

286
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:35,781
No matter what the ending is, how can you say
I am just another girl that passes you by.

287
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:39,066
Don't think to complicated of it, frustrating.

288
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,730
If I turn a little weird, point it out
to me immediately, I will change.

289
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:49,888
Let's go, quick.
I have to get to work early today.

290
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:52,705
Go.

291
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:55,899
Quick, quick.

292
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:58,084
Quick run, quick run.

293
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:07,614
Yes?

294
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:10,383
Can I come in?

295
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,383
Yes, what's up?

296
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,224
The money you like.

297
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:19,517
Work?

298
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,517
Whisky advertisement information.

299
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:25,109
Looks like I can't look at this.

300
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:30,105
I am working in another company right now.

301
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:34,324
Competitor company's information,
I can't look at it, right?

302
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,324
Yes.

303
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:40,439
Jun Mo gives me some
work to do occasionally.

304
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:42,921
Then forget it.

305
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:45,501
I will go off first.

306
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:03,685
Hyung Tae.

307
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:09,062
Sorry.

308
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,492
What?

309
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:12,492
Nothing.

310
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:14,890
Just, thank you.

311
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:43,847
Is this the information on the
company we are meeting today?

312
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:45,551
Yes.

313
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:50,430
[Planner by / Byun Hyung Tae]

314
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,184
<i>Everyone.</i>

315
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:32,926
<i>I am a bad person.</i>

316
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:38,371
<i>Everyone knows, I have seduced
Ji Sun that everyone loves, right?</i>

317
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:45,372
My relationships with girls
have not been very discreet.

318
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:50,672
Because I was two timing,
I got dumped by the other party.

319
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,906
What are you doing?

320
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:59,180
From now on, do not check
on my indiscreet relationships.

321
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:00,764
Hey, Hyung Tae.

322
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,688
Record it on the phone,
let me get to work.

323
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,375
Okay, okay, anything.

324
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:12,562
If it helps the company, then please
let me go comfortably to work.

325
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:19,090
Now, I need that time even more.
Everyone... everyone that does not notice,

326
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,185
Everyone.

327

I am a bad person.

Everyone knows, I have seduced
the Ji Sun that everyone loves.

329
00:25:29,008 --> 00:25:33,601
My relationships with girls
have not been very discreet.

330

<i>Say it out.</i>

331
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:38,744
<i>Say it out, say it out.</i>

332
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:41,273
Who is the other party?

333
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,273
I have already forgotten.

334
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,927

335
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:50,292

<i>Please.</i>

338
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,588
I know.

339
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:06,166
It's okay, forget about the clothes.

340
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:09,767
I have clothes to wear.

341
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:13,297
Why did you suddenly...

342
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:16,050
Mom.

343
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,547
I am working.

344
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:20,448
I know, I will be on time.

345
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:22,483
Don't worry.

346
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,597
Going for match-making?

347
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,927
Yes.

348
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,313
You're going for match-making?

349
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:35,599
I am a representative.

350
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,955
You mean you are going
for match-making too?

351
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:41,955
You know my mom's temper.

352
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,215
This.

353
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,788
Don't know if you are satisfied with it.

354
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:52,224
When I look through it in the afternoon,
I will contact you.

355
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:54,685
And, there is one more
thing that needs your help.

356
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,685
Next time, I don't wish to do it.

357
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,821
My own work, I have accumulated a lot.

358
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,052
Novels?

359
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,931
Yes.

360
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:09,332
But, can you show me the novels
you have written? I am very curious.

361
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,954
If it gets to be published,
then we will talk about it.

362
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:18,284
I want to see it before that happens.

363
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,264
Now I am still not considered a writer.

364
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:26,215
But an unfinished work is also
considered private. Can't let anyone see it.

365
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:31,480
How is it?

366
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,480
Just stay put.

367
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:38,386
Your leg is shaking. This... this...
This is very interesting, right?

368
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:41,607
Why?

369
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:45,026
You are too excited, can't stand it only.

370
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:49,299
Maybe you are the first and the last reader.
Just let me be excited for a bit.

371
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:51,171
This...

372
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:55,936
Maybe it can be published as a book.

373
00:27:57,914 --> 00:27:59,799
Hey, would you like a drink?

374
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:02,439
I already put two in the refrigerator.

375
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:04,661
You really...

376
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:09,571
<i>We still get along well</i>

377
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,646
<i>The Magic Princess Minky
has found her way here</i>

378
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,646
<i>From the planet</i>

379
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:21,001
<i>Minky found her way here</i>

380
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:21,998
Planet?

381
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:23,473
That is Sally.

382
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:26,532
Here.

383
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:35,287
When did you write this?
I see that you weren't home.

384
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:37,287
I wrote it outside.

385
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:40,022
Next time write it at home, okay?

386
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:45,030
You can also play and bounce the balls.

387
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:47,539
That.

388
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:50,131
I can't use it.

389
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:54,370
The wound is much better, thanks to you.

390
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:56,370
That is great.

391
00:28:57,755 --> 00:28:59,262
How is it?

392
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:01,730
Looks like there is a little feeling.

393
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,312
Come.

394
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,729
I can just use to this apply for a messenger?

395
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:28,235
Thank you.

396
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:32,579
No.

397
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:35,869
Not divorcing.

398
00:29:36,705 --> 00:29:39,440
Why does dad and mom
have to get a divorce?

399
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,340
Of course.

400
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:46,297
Adults, they will quarrel too sometimes.

401
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,939
If I had knew of this way earlier,
we could have gotten in touch more.

402
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:59,020
Dad...

403
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,422
Using this,

404
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:02,862
I will talk to mom more.

405
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:04,862
<i>Hyungnim.</i>

406
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,736
Okay, thank you.

407
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:09,084
Oh okay.

408
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,821
Okay, dad too. Bye.

409
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:16,344
Can you teach me how to use messenger?

410
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,344
I will teach you.

411
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,697
Really making one crazy.

412
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,697
Today you brought kimbab over.

413
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:25,224
You should forgive her, what happened?

414
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:26,620
Dragging time, right?

415
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:29,874
If not, when do we get
the chance to see this lady?

416
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:32,180
Who let you take care of my meals?
Are you playing with me?

417
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:34,180
I cannot do anything for you.

418
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,613
Ask your head to come see me. Head.

419
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:38,613
Customer.

420
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:41,316
Please let me off.

421
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:44,876
If I don't settle this, I will be fired.

422
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,317
Miss, do you stay near here?

423
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,881
You don't bother her.

424
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:49,881
Don't kneel anymore.

425
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:53,903
Customer, really sorry.

426
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:56,547
I am really in the wrong.

427
00:30:56,575 --> 00:30:59,031
If you still don't bring
your head here tomorrow,

428
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,789
I will go to court immediately, do you hear?

429
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,040
Can you please let me off?

430
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,985
Customer.

431
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:11,844
Really poor thing, don't kneel.
Come to my room.

432
00:31:11,863 --> 00:31:14,105
Cool down a little too.

433
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,650
You are too much, quick go learn.

434
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,974
Come out.

435
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:19,618
Really.

436
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:28,115
Aren't you even afraid of coming
to a house where only men live?

437
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:31,704
I am really sorry.

438
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:34,918
Please forgive me, customer.

439
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:40,284
You are driving me crazy.

440
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:42,385
Could you forgive if it was you?

441
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,471
Saying my wife was cheating on me,
and going to hotels...

442
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,672
Hearing those kinds of things...

443
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:53,083
Do you know how I felt?

444
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:55,083
I know, I know.

445
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:58,890
I know for sure, and I understand
where you are coming from.

446
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:02,314
If you know then leave.

447
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,140
Really don't come here again.

448
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:11,538
Your beauty will not work on me.

449
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,677
I'm sorry.

450
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:25,176
It was funny what you said
about me using beauty...

451
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,176
I'm sorry.

452
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,176
I'm really sorry.

453
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,347
Just go.

454
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,789
I will teach you how to use messenger.

455
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:39,574
I'm sorry.

456
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:53,807
[Messenger]

457
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:04,165
What kind of messenger do you use?

458
00:33:07,503 --> 00:33:13,764
Nighton, RSN, or Buddy Buddy...
you know there are a lot of different kinds...

459
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,423
What is that?

460
00:33:18,676 --> 00:33:19,884
I will find it for you.

461
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:21,125
It's okay.

462
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:26,224
You can never find it doing it like that.

463
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:29,915
I will find it for you.

464
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:37,825
If it is my course, would it be RSN?

465
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,072
Let's see... ID... what should I use an id?

466
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:49,677
- Flying Chick.
- Flying Chick...

467
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:51,130
It can be in Korean?

468
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:52,883
Of course.

469
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,246
Oh! I think it's working.

470
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:14,838
Then press this...

471
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:19,093
You found it! You found it at once!

472
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:22,091
Oh, it is this.

473
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,435
[Jennifer: Who are you?]

474
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,906
[Flying Chick: Honey. ]

475
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:40,881
Oh, I won't look. I won't look.

476
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,029
[Because you would not pick up the phone]

477
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,192
Suddenly the writings have disappeared.

478
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,192
Huh?

479
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,678
[Jennifer is offline, she may not answer back. ]

480
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:18,384
Why are you calling at this hour?

481
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,185
<i>Just to see what you were doing.</i>

482
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:22,185
I was looking for reference materials.

483
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,185
Hmm, that's what I thought.

484
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:26,185
<i>How did that thing go?</i>

485
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,185
It is not solved yet.

486
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,825
What are you going to do?

487
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,825
I was planning to go again tomorrow.

488
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,072
Nan Hee.

489
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:40,725
At age 30, a high school graduate...

490
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,224
Do you think I could find another job?

491
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:47,088
If you can be satisfied with my salary
there are a lot of things to do.

492
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,519
How can I live with that?

493
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,338
He's not budging at all?

494
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:55,491
I think I have done something
worse than I thought.

495
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:58,031
You didn't do it on purpose,
what are you to do?

496
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:04,233
Nan Hee, it seems like there are
a lot of sad people in this world.

497
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:08,198
Tough Kim Chun Hee is actually
worrying about the world.

498
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,265
Your life really has become
more plentiful. hasn't it?

499
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,005
It seems so.

500
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:16,428
It just seems like yesterday that I
was comforted at seeing miserable people...

501
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,429
Thinking that the world was like that to everyone.

502
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:24,513
But now another person's
misery is hurting my heart.

503
00:36:24,553 --> 00:36:26,513
Who is that miserable?

504
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:31,036
Just... even by just watching human theater*.
(*Human theater - a Korean documentary show)

505
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:33,886
You know Kyung Ha unni?

506
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,284
<i>Oh, that manhwa unni?</i>

507
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,358
Yes. Remember I told you she
liked that swimming instructor.

508
00:36:41,955 --> 00:36:45,714
But he called her mother today.

509
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,510
<i>Oh my gosh... to her?</i>

510
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:56,557
But the saddest part is unni could not say anything
to that and she just put up a white flag of defeat.

511
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,143
What? That is more shocking?

512
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:04,600
I guess a day like that will come to us to.

513
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:09,504
When we can no longer fight against
words like ahjumma and mother.

514
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:13,437
Yes, she looked like she did not
even have energy to respond.

515
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:18,465
Nan Hee, let's quickly get married!

516
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:31,088
It's today?

517
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,528
Yes.

518
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,160
Do well.

519
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:37,160
Fighting.

520
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,852
It's Saturday. Where are you going?

521
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:42,279
I have to go out because there is a recording.

522
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,741
I am going to do the laundry if you have
any give them to me before you leave.

523
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:48,728
It's okay. I will do my own.

524
00:37:56,727 --> 00:37:59,398
Why is he going as far as telling me Fighting?

525
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,961
Hyung Tae, I am going to go out first.

526
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:55,267
<i>Looks like it's the Civil Defense Corps.</i>

527
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,380
Cant we just go?

528
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:01,380
Do they still have Civil Defense
training nowadays too?

529
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:09,352
<i>It's a real situation right now, right?</i>

530
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:15,041
Tell me whenever you feel uncomfortable.
I will look for an empty room somewhere.

531
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:20,323
I'm not going to go further.

532
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,323
Even if you said lets go further I will not.

533
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:32,199
I dont want to be doing it
because I am lonely either.

534
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:45,612
Dont you think we know about each
other too much for us to be dating?

535
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:45,647
Should we stop here?

536
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:54,555
I dont think I could be a woman
to you as Sung Ah was a woman to you.

537
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:58,392
I am afraid to go any further.

538
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:02,855
Because I think everything will be
messed up when we go back to Seoul.

539
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:06,850
Lets stop here.

540
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,468
Until we go back to Seoul,
we'll get Civil Defense training. Okay?

541
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:19,261
Let me ask a favor.

542
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,565
What?

543
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:24,304
You have to forget everything.

544
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:26,702
Yes.

545
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:28,263
Everything.

546
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:30,263
Okay.

547
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,049
Why didn't you call?

548
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,049
Out of the blue.

549
00:42:31,102 --> 00:42:33,673
We used to call each other
at least ten times everyday.

550
00:42:33,703 --> 00:42:35,726
Calling each other to make sure we had eaten.

551
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:37,666
Calling if something good happened.

552
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,516
And calling if something
that made us mad happened.

553
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:44,826
I just ate a few moments ago,
and nothing has happened yet.

554
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:48,850
After vacationing with you,
my call log is empty of your calls.

555
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,850
<i>So what?</i>

556
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:53,795
You said to tell you if I felt awkward.

557
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:55,648
<i>Then let's change it.</i>

558
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,128
Where are you?

559
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,128
<i>On the road.</i>

560
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:03,361
Oh, I guess you're tied up also then.

561
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:04,834
<i>Yeah.</i>

562
00:43:05,008 --> 00:43:06,316
Will you be late?

563
00:43:06,354 --> 00:43:08,316
I think there is going to be an after party.

564
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:09,909
Because today is the last recording day.

565
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:11,909
<i>Then you are going to drink?</i>

566
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:13,068
I guess.

567
00:43:13,095 --> 00:43:15,068
<i>You took your car.</i>

568
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,904
I will get a designated driver.

569
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:18,433
Okay.

570
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:20,433
Don't drink and drive.

571
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:22,061
Have I ever?

572
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:24,911
<i>I know you don't but still...</i>

573
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:27,289
Where are you?

574
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,927
Subway.

575
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:30,927
<i>You are going to be late for your appointment.</i>

576
00:43:30,961 --> 00:43:34,045
Did you also know that people still
get Civil Defense training?

577
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,291
Yeah...

578
00:43:36,477 --> 00:43:39,282
I guess because I passed by without
paying much attention I didn't know.

579
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:41,056
Yeah, I guess so.

580
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:44,140
<i>I don't think now I can just pass by it.</i>

581
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:48,837
I think I will remember forever.

582
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,837
Whenever I hear the siren sounds.

583
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,975
I will remember you.

584
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:57,585
Until I die.

585
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:01,829
Do not confuse me.

586
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,490
It rang, go.

587
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,732
Okay.

588
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:31,088
That commercial? Yes, I've seen it.

589
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:32,658
You saw it.

590
00:44:32,693 --> 00:44:34,658
That is what I do.

591
00:44:34,695 --> 00:44:39,454
How to put a lactobacillus into a capsule and
have it travel safely into the stomach.

592
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:44,742
Oh, yes. They also use this in the medicine field,
which is much more interesting.

593
00:44:44,763 --> 00:44:50,678
And so the depending on where the healthy bacteria
is activated in the stomach or large intestines...

594
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:53,879
There is a big difference in the effectiveness.

595
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:59,688
Sometimes it comes out straight
through in your poop... sorry.

596
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,091
I mean feces...

597
00:45:01,107 --> 00:45:02,892
You are drinking your coffee.

598
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,159
Sometimes it comes straight out
through your feces...

599
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:09,417
You are pretty.

600
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:16,254
If I tell you about the history
of micro organisms... that country...

601
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:19,054
I am shaking, right?

602
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,970
- Good job.
- Good job.

603
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:26,849
Good job. You are going to eat then go, right?

604
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:28,351
Of course. Let's go eat.

605
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:29,582
Yes, let's.

606
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,167
I had a feeling we would meet.

607
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,708
Hey, me whatever... but didn't you
mess up your date because of me?

608
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,960
She seemed pretty okay.

609
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,506
It's not fun to go on blind dates, right?

610
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:46,184
My mom is going to kill me.

611
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,432
Yeah, reporting about the blind date
is more tedious than the date itself.

612
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,831
But was that guy no good?

613
00:45:52,857 --> 00:45:54,831
Yes.

614
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:59,028
But thanks to him I have learned
a lot of facts about micro organisms.

615
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,263
I mean how can bacterium be more useful
than a human being like Hong Nan Hee?

616
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,393
It doesn't even compare.

617
00:46:09,297 --> 00:46:10,972
Would you like to order?

618
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:11,940
Eat something delicious.

619
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,090
I will buy.

620
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:15,529
I said I would buy a meal
after the work was done.

621
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:17,529
I want to buy it.

622
00:46:17,923 --> 00:46:19,342
We will order in a little bit.

623
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:21,342
Okay.

624
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:25,947
I couldn't even buy you anything
delicious because I was a student.

625
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,919
No, wait I wasn't a student
but a repeating student.

626
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,863
How did you date a repeating student?

627
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:39,035
I'm suddenly thankful for those years.

628
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:49,471
I haven't seen this bracelet before.

629
00:46:50,903 --> 00:46:55,113
I guess he felt that something was weird...
he's been treating me nice lately.

630
00:46:56,085 --> 00:47:04,014
What you said before that beautiful girl
you were talking about was Ji Sun, right?

631
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:07,177
Because of you, noona I have
become totally screwed up.

632
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:12,421
Then something happened with your friend?

633
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:16,422
You, you, you, you... what if you lose Ji Sun?

634
00:47:16,455 --> 00:47:17,878
Lower your volume.

635
00:47:17,914 --> 00:47:19,184
Is that what happened?

636
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,201
You idiot.

637
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:21,844
Did you get caught?

638
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,715
That is not it...

639
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:24,821
Go apologize to her.

640
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,187
I told you that's not it.

641
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:29,928
Are you sure you are a copywriter?

642
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,522
What are you going to hit me?

643
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:34,522
That is...

644
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,621
That is...

645
00:47:41,241 --> 00:47:45,447
It seems as though something
precious has disappeared.

646
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,562
I shouldn't have done that.

647
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:53,842
It was the best the way it was.

648
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:57,030
I should have kept it the way it was.

649
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,025
Why did I do that?

650
00:48:05,235 --> 00:48:09,823
That is... It was like a Civil Defense training.

651
00:48:10,038 --> 00:48:11,065
Huh?

652
00:48:11,092 --> 00:48:16,317
That was knowing and not knowing...

653
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:24,102
It was like a safety net that
kept us safe from the enemy.

654
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:26,600
Shorten it to one line... one line.

655
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:28,820
The conclusion is...

656
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:35,622
I, noona, do you know what I hate the most?

657
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:37,131
What is it?

658
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,621
Try to guess it. Try to guess it.

659
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:43,920
Hey, stop. This Miss' heart will start to race.

660
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:49,881
That is... yogurt.

661
00:48:50,484 --> 00:48:52,508
Hey, I'm about to get annoyed.

662
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,508
You know I have no patience, right?

663
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,784
I love you, noona. I love you.

664
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,440
Love... love...

665
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:08,047
That is a really hard word but
it is also a good and thankful word.

666
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,628
Love.

667
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:19,956
Designated driver.

668
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:24,309
What is the number?

669
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:29,425
Designated driver is... Hong Nan Hee.

670
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:32,630
Hong Nan Hee.

671
00:49:34,107 --> 00:49:36,655
Hong Nan Hee, right?

672
00:49:37,736 --> 00:49:38,955
Do you want me to take you?

673
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:41,314
No, he says he is near here.
I can just take a taxi.

674
00:49:41,332 --> 00:49:42,517
Did he say he drank a lot?

675
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:44,087
Yes. It seems he is a bit drunk.

676
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:47,173
After taking Hyung Tae home,
you will be a lot late getting home.

677
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,019
Will you be okay alone?

678
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:50,019
Yes, I will be okay. Don't worry.

679
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:51,046
I will head out first.

680
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,068
Be careful.

681
00:49:52,095 --> 00:49:53,679
Thanks.

682
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:06,323
Be careful, careful, careful. Get in, in.

683
00:50:06,415 --> 00:50:08,323
I'm not drunk.

684
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:13,906
Then we will get going.

685
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:20,708
Miss, are you Hyung Tae's friend?

686
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:21,463
What?

687
00:50:21,492 --> 00:50:23,463
His closest friend?

688
00:50:23,547 --> 00:50:27,427
Uh, it seems so.

689
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:36,830
Should we buy medicine?

690
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:38,830
I'm not drunk.

691
00:50:39,184 --> 00:50:41,702
Your voice sounds fine.

692
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:44,971
I am totally fine. Totally Fine.

693
00:50:45,012 --> 00:50:47,108
Hey.

694
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:49,675
You, sing.

695
00:50:49,704 --> 00:50:51,110
What song?

696
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,545
Sing whatever you think of.

697
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,110
Sing Magic Princess Minky or something.

698
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,110
But I'm driving right now.

699
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:06,685
<i>Often when I think of you</i>

700
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:10,125
<i>Always felt that you were close by,
but you were actually faraway</i>

701
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,254
Hey, dance also.

702
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,702
Hey, I am driving.

703
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:19,942
Hyung Tae?

704
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:21,942
Yes?

705
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:25,698
Teach me to play the guitar.

706
00:51:30,207 --> 00:51:32,374
I kept telling you I would teach you
and you kept saying no,

707
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,475
Why suddenly do you want to learn?

708
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:38,851
Before you wouldn't let me
touch your guitar.

709
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,161
Saying Sung Ah gave it to you.

710
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,260
I didn't like that.

711
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:58,906
Do... you want to learn?

712
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,123
Yes, I want to try.

713
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:27,136
Mi, right?

714
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,745
Maybe not...

715
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:43,142
Fa, so, la, si, do...

716
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:44,965
Oh.

717
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:48,511
Why did you suddenly think of
learning how to play the guitar?

718
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:54,544
You were able to muster up courage, but it seemed
I was not even able to muster up courage.

719
00:52:56,232 --> 00:52:57,911
- Like this.
- Hey.

720
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:01,494
Let's try to avoid unnecessary physical contact.

721
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:05,412
We are not at the stage to be like this
in a closed off space like this.

722
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:07,249
We have done this more than once or twice...

723
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:09,859
But now you are doing this as a man.

724
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:12,678
Is it different?

725
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,427
It's a bit different.

726
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:17,044
You did all kinds of things with Jang Ga*.
(*Jang Ga - name of a dog aka Jung Joo).

727
00:53:17,085 --> 00:53:19,044
And in daylight in my house.

728
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:21,694
Those things really don't bother you?

729
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,934
My past doesn't bother you?

730
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,196
I hate it.

731
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:30,361
The road to go is so long.

732
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:37,908
Then... shall Ms. Hong play her first song.

733
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,417
What? Already?

734
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:41,130
Just do as I say.

735
00:53:41,173 --> 00:53:42,882
First la, sol.

736
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:44,882
La? Sol?

737
00:53:44,919 --> 00:53:46,467
La, sol.

738
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,467
Now do, mi.

739
00:53:51,968 --> 00:53:52,823
Okay.

740
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:56,028
Now this time la, sol twice and mi, re twice.

741
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:59,847
Play la long, but sol short, mi long, but re short.

742
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:01,664
La, sol, la, sol, mi, re, mi, re.

743
00:54:01,691 --> 00:54:02,892
While looking!

744
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:04,610
Wait a minute.

745
00:54:09,468 --> 00:54:11,156
Hey!

746
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:13,156
Good job, cheetah.

747
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,758
Save me, Tarzan!

748
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,860
Wait a minute, Jane.

749
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,314
Whoa! Whoa!

750
00:54:17,573 --> 00:54:18,694
Do you want to go watch a movie?

751
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:19,417
Now?

752
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:23,937
No. Next week at Seoul Plus they are
holding a winter film festival... three movies.

753
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:25,937
Why winter films in the summer?

754
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:27,937
Because it's summer they are winter films.

755
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,937
They are even playing Love Letter.

756
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:32,991
You're wanting to vent out some anger
with this chance, aren't you?

757
00:54:33,026 --> 00:54:34,927
Bad girl.

758
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:38,213
Throwing away a soldier who took break
and was waiting for you with tickets...

759
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:40,214
...to go spend the night with some other guy.

760
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,332
Shall we go Monday?

761
00:54:41,355 --> 00:54:45,273
If you bail on me again, I will not be
able to see that masterpiece again.

762
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:50,130
Now there are no guys who are flirting
with me to spend the night with them.

763
00:54:50,147 --> 00:54:53,681
I am flirting with you to spend
the night watching movies with me.

764
00:54:58,143 --> 00:55:00,724
Shall I try this one more time?

765
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:18,141
<i>Byun Hyung Tae is the shape of poop</i>

766
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:25,424
Stop. No more.

767
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:30,341
<i>Byun Hyun Tae is the shape of poop</i>

768
00:56:40,994 --> 00:56:42,869
You have prepared a lot.

769
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:45,615
But let's end it here.

770
00:56:45,773 --> 00:56:49,827
As you know we are looking
round to some other places.

771
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:55,693
As for these documents, I think it would be better
to take a look at them after I choose a company.

772
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:57,693
Okay.

773
00:56:58,227 --> 00:57:03,479
What I want to tell you is that our company
has a strong marketing team.

774
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:09,845
It is the first time to launch an album
through an advertising firm...

775
00:57:10,846 --> 00:57:19,846
and because you usually played in Europe, the Asian
market demographics will be an important point.

776
00:57:19,872 --> 00:57:24,613
Yes, because we understand this we are
trying to approach it more rationally.

777
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,095
Mr. Kim, one moment.

778
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:33,095
Yes.

779
00:57:41,393 --> 00:57:43,614
You didn't say one word.

780
00:57:45,479 --> 00:57:48,075
Mr. Kim takes care of everything.

781
00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:51,422
Usually the youngest and
the eldest lack communication.

782
00:57:51,456 --> 00:57:53,422
A meeting place is usually...

783
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,946
May 25th is your birthday, right?

784
00:57:59,536 --> 00:58:04,077
I went to Seung Won's grave a few months ago and
I saw that the day he passed away was May 25th.

785
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:10,068
Do you know Seung Won?

786
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:12,114
It was your birthday, right?

787
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:14,114
That is what Chun Hee said.

788
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,988
Who are you?

789
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:17,276
Do you know them?

790
00:58:17,289 --> 00:58:18,603
How are they?

791
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:20,603
Are they doing well?

792
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:26,298
I see.

793
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:29,471
They already have three kids.

794
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:33,780
I played for them at their wedding.

795
00:58:38,026 --> 00:58:39,809
How is Nan Hee?

796
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,318
She works at a publishing company.

797
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:45,236
She doesn't write novels?

798
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:47,236
She still writes.

799
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,967
I really want to see everyone.

800
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,679
I lived in Korea for exactly five years.

801
00:58:53,722 --> 00:58:57,144
And all the memories that I have
of here are with those friends.

802
00:58:58,099 --> 00:58:59,905
It was really good.

803
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:02,881
Did you not stay in contact with them at all?

804
00:59:04,516 --> 00:59:06,402
I'm so sorry I was cold to you before.

805
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,924
Because you kept staring, I thought
you were a strange person.

806
00:59:10,925 --> 00:59:12,625
Do you want to meet them all?

807
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:15,810
Do you want me to call them all up?

808
00:59:16,143 --> 00:59:19,297
If I could I would have contacted them first.

809
00:59:21,578 --> 00:59:25,270
I have only been fiddling with my cell phone
the couple days I have been in Seoul.

810
00:59:25,557 --> 00:59:27,270
Why?

811
00:59:27,506 --> 00:59:30,647
I have given such a big pain to everyone.

812
00:59:32,518 --> 00:59:36,210
I had prepared my heart strongly
before coming to Korea,

813
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:40,211
But once here I can't
seem to push the button.

814
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:47,948
It is good hearing their news
at least this way. Thank you.

815
00:59:48,812 --> 00:59:52,372
But why don't you ask about Hyung Tae?

816
00:59:55,002 --> 00:59:57,866
It seems he was doing okay.

817
00:59:57,932 --> 00:59:59,866
Did you meet him?

818
00:59:59,953 --> 01:00:03,241
I just saw him... from afar.

819
01:00:04,652 --> 01:00:07,439
A person like you even stalks?

820
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,439
Didn't mean to.

821
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:11,439
Didn't mean to?

822
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,760
That is... friend?

823
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:20,597
Friend.

824
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:24,993
Ah, I remembered.

825
01:00:25,014 --> 01:00:27,818
You were Nan Hee's boyfriend, right?

826
01:00:28,403 --> 01:00:30,286
A very long time ago.

827
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:33,384
I've seen your picture before.

828
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:37,183
We are all meeting up Friday,
do you want to go together?

829
01:00:53,468 --> 01:00:56,833
Sang Hoon got a job.

830
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:59,563
I got the call. Aren't you
getting ready for work?

831
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:01,992
I will.

832
01:01:02,713 --> 01:01:05,616
But what about the movie?

833
01:01:05,692 --> 01:01:08,545
It's at night. We can go after it's over.

834
01:01:09,785 --> 01:01:13,594
But if the two of us go out,
won't they think it's weird?

835
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,596
When have we ever gone out separately?

836
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,911
True.

837
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:18,825
I am not going to drink tonight, help out.

838
01:01:18,848 --> 01:01:19,956
Why?

839
01:01:19,974 --> 01:01:23,586
Because I need to drive and treat
someone through the full course. Why?

840
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:29,786
Exactly who is Poop-sama going
to treat that late at night?

841
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:33,640
Don't ever do something like that again.
My hair is about to stand up.

842
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:35,640
Right.

843
01:01:35,688 --> 01:01:36,785
Let's act the way we have been.

844
01:01:37,609 --> 01:01:38,541
Go to work well.

845
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:40,541
You too.

846
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:05,957
I can't I am picking out clothes
to look good for Hyung Tae.

847
01:02:06,118 --> 01:02:08,463
What am I doing?

848
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,945
Congratulations to Sang Hoon for his new job!

849
01:02:40,985 --> 01:02:42,945
Thank you.

850
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:47,341
How much is the pay?

851
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,341
Why does that matter?

852
01:02:49,401 --> 01:02:52,492
My husband is making a living.

853
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:54,284
You deserve it.

854
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:58,167
See what it feels like to
make a living with your body.

855
01:02:58,213 --> 01:03:02,471
Your immature saying that it is best to have
many children as possible will be shattered...

856
01:03:02,472 --> 01:03:04,472
...and you will soon kneel in front of Mi Kyung.

857
01:03:04,551 --> 01:03:06,581
That day will come soon, right?

858
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:08,631
Wasn't today a congratulatory party?

859
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,465
What kind of company is it?

860
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,261
It is just a small management company.

861
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,203
Congratulations, anyway.

862
01:03:24,138 --> 01:03:26,340
[I am on my way now. ]
