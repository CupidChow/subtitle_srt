00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:18,632
I...

4
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:24,724
I think coming to fish was a mistake.

5
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,841
I...

6
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:44,249
Think I'm falling for Nan Hee.

00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:33,005
Why are you suddenly watching pro baseball?

9
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,027
I knew you were Jung Joo's fan,

10
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:36,529
but were you really a baseball fan?

11
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:38,491
Baseball is fun.

12
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:40,529
Kim Jung Hoon player is same age as us.

13
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,238
I want to cheer for him.

14
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,449
Don't empathize.

15
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:48,143
If he is able to recover successfully,
I think I'll get some strength too.

16
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:53,650
Hey! Although this baseball player
had a misfortune, he is a genius!

17
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:57,543
Oh! It's starting!

18
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,941
Jung Joo left.

19
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:13,007
He got on the plane and left.

20
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:21,323
I want to go here.

21
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,706
I wanted to go on vacation anyway.

22
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:28,409
I'll just think of it as a gift from Jung Joo.

23
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:34,422
I'm also thankful for this gift.

24
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,092
No, you can't.

25
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,291
It's not like it's the first time we go together.

26
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:40,406
I told you to stop acting like this.

27
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,892
Why do you ignore me?

28
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:43,103

Hey...

31
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,235
Don't you think that pitcher was too harsh?

32
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:29,698
How can he be like that to
a guy who used to be a legend?

33
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,430
How dare he pitch three strikes?

34
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:36,291
That little punk was too rough on him.

35
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:40,083
I'm tired. Let's eat.

36
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:44,421
I have to go see my mother today.

37
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:47,256
Hey! You want me to eat alone?

38
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:01,577
Hey.

39
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,320
Isn't it your birthday?

40
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:05,633
Yeah.

41
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,315
You don't even care.

42
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:10,077
Then why are you here like this?

43
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:11,917
Aren't you meeting Ji Sun?

44
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,880
Good thing I had some bulgogi* left from before.
(*Grilled marinated beef)

45
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,972
See that, don't you think
it's better than a restaurant?

46
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:32,957
Why are you hanging out
with her on your birthday?

47
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:34,934
I can't change my luck, right?

48
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,157
Are you really bloated?

49
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,076
Why?

50
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,302
Don't ask.

51
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:42,229
You get bloated too?

52
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:43,317
Do you need help?

53
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:44,973
No, just sit down.

54
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:47,301
A man in a kitchen makes it worse.

55
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,412
Do you have any radish kimchi left?
It was delicious.

56
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,852
I knew you'd ask.

57
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,492
Mom, I'll take it out.

58
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:59,633
It's always better to get kimchi from
your own house rather than someone else.

59
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,857
Thank you for dinner, I'll enjoy it.

60
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,888
I heard girls are all over you!

61
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:10,068
Who told you that?

62
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:12,796
She wanted to give you
some food at your house,

63
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,301
but there are some things there she
wouldn't want see, so I told her not to go.

64
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,267
Hey!

65
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:17,723
What?

66
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,960
Did I say something wrong?

67
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,106
Dating is nice.

68
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,243
But don't bring them back to your house.

69
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,288
You listen as well.

70
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:33,530
Don't disappoint your parents
and think about your life.

71
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:34,531
Okay?

72
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:37,621
Don't do anything on a whim.

73
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:41,523
You'll know who is right
for you when it happens.

74
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:44,236
Eat.

75
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:48,726
Congratulations.

76
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:50,543
Should I sing for you?

77
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,585
It's okay.

78
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,601
What did you want to say?

79
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:56,336
Huh?

80
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:57,792
You told me to come because
you had something to say.

81
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,117
Oh...

82
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,060
I got a blind date for you.

83
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,856
What do you think?

84
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:06,614
I'll go.

85
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:09,066
If you're nervous,

86
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:10,752
We can take it slow.

87
00:06:10,855 --> 00:06:12,909
There is no point if you're doing it for fun.

88
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,564
I'm not doing it for fun.

89
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,414
I regret missing out on other dates.

90
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:20,321
I want to get married before I get too old.

91
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,578
Are you serious?

92
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:23,110
Set it up for next weekend.

93
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:24,260
Alright then.

94
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,136
What does he do?

95
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,984
I'm sick of being in love.

96
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,013
Jung Joo was my last.

97
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,228
And I don't think anything
better is in plan for my life.

98
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:52,072
I don't have any more energy
left to fall and get back again.

99
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:55,153
How do you know?

100
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,414
I just do.

101
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,633
I think it's one of the good things of being older.

102
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,073
That's why...

103
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,366
You shouldn't come with me.

104
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:13,171
I want to clear my head.

105
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,086
And let go of what's left,

106
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:19,914
And when I come back I want
to be ready for a new life.

107
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:21,059
No.

108
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,756
I'm going to be right next to you.

109
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,565
I was thinking about not going
when you forgot my birthday but...

110
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:30,048
Then I guess I want you to be mad still.

111
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:34,326
Fine then.

112
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:37,897
If you really want to go alone, then you
can decide whether to take me or not.

113
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:42,204
Didn't you say that you were going to work as a yogurt
researcher and officially jump into the market?

114
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:48,336
We really did go on a lot of vacation together.

115
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:49,730
Yeah, we did.

116
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,305
Do you think we will ever again?

117
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,518
I feel like this may be our last chance.

118
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:05,579
It's not even autumn yet the wind
just goes through my heart.

119
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:12,655
Let's stop by the pharmacy.

120
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,214
You always get stomach problems on vacations.

121
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:17,283
Buy a tranquilizer too.

122
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,310
Tranquilizer?

123
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,830
I'm going to make a bombshell
announcement during our trip.

124
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:22,639
What kind of bombshell announcement?

125
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:26,381
That I'm sick of trying to be your friend.

126
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,922
I love you, my friend.

127
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:32,106
Watch what you say!

128
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,271
Why love...

129
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:44,508
Hey! Say it louder and
sing something refreshing.

130
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,588
Refreshing?

131
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,627
Don't you know that it's illegal?

132
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:23,390
You talked bad about our customers
and his personal information.

133
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:28,279
If they find out, then you're fired
and the company has to pay fines.

134
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:33,945
You worked here for ten years but
how can you make this kind of mistake?

135
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:36,734
What really happened?

136
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,447
I was talking after the phone call
but I guess it didn't go off.

137
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:45,137
But after talking to him, I think
that's what really happened.

138
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:49,487
You didn't even know for sure and you
talked about his wife such and such?

139
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,150
Even if the phone was off,
you really do have problems.

140
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:55,112
You even said they cheated and such.

141
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,843
You should be fired.

142
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:00,207
Director.

143
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,534
I'll meet him personally and apologize.

144
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,358
Please, Director.

145
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,013
You should definitely beg!

146
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,989
You should hold on and beg
until he forgives you.

147
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:15,560
Even then, I can't promise you
I'll put food on your table.

148
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:21,774
Go meet him immediately, if you don't,
he said he'll call the police.

149
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:27,782
Welcome.

150
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,575
Welcome, boss.

151
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:36,150
You're not playing games, are you?

152
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,081
Huh?

153
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:42,321
I'm just worried.

154
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,704
No, I'm not like that it's just for fun.

155
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:48,651
I think you're addicted.

156
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,005
Well it's good when my head is stuffy.

157
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,921
Then there's a problem.

158
00:10:54,285 --> 00:11:00,676
What good would it do when I can see
a man's life just wasting away?

159
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:02,576
I apologize.

160
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,629
<i>Are you sick of life?</i>

161
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,874
<i>I mean how can you not be
excited about anything you do.</i>

162
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,970
<i>Does this job bore you that much
that you can't handle it?</i>

163
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,615
Pick up.

164
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:44,592
Pick up please.

165
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:51,473
<i>If you're tired of this then just tell me.
I'll let you go respectfully.</i>

166
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:56,886
<i>Either pick up your phone or turn it off.</i>

167
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:01,087
Let me see this month's work.

168
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,740
Huh?

169
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,832
Okay, let me organize it first.

170
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:11,493
Nam Jung, the number of magazine copies
that we've solved have gone up.

171
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,474
How much?

172
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:15,182
Enough to buy a marine center.

173
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,818
Oh great!

174
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,592
Is this the vacation proposal?

175
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,375
Oh my goodness! You want
whole two weeks of vacation.

176
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:30,042
Yes, I wanted to go see my kids.

177
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,043
[Leave application form]

178
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,744
His eyes were so pretty.

179
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:58,419
He always looked at me
with his clear sparkling eyes.

180
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:03,428
It's because he's an idiot.

181
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,429
How can a young boy have
any sign of age in his eyes?

182
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,369
Are you really going to be like that?

183
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,240
And you said you wanted meet another guy?

184
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,278
Aren't you even sorry?

185
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,753
I'm going to bury him during this vacation anyway.

186
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:25,967
Help me bury him.

187
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:31,837
Remember for me that there
once was Jung Joo and me.

188
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:33,492
I don't want to.

189
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:35,844
I did it for you.

190
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:42,357
In the corner of my heart, there's a
place left for you and Sung Ah.

191
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:56,157
Can you stop bouncing that ball at night?

192
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:02,410
At home?

193
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:03,896
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,521
I won't do it anymore.

195
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:09,655
Nan Hee.

196
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,713
Yes?

197
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:15,096
I think I like you.

198
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,549
Why are you so serious?

199
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,879
I like you too.

200
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,530
What should I do now?

201
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,822
Ms. Hong, are you still alive?

202
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:43,289
Huh?

203
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:51,408
You didn't say anything for four hours now.

204
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,676
Already?

205
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,392
I'll take that as your answer.

206
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:05,009
How much do you like me?

207
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,513
Look at me.

208
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:22,542
Don't be bothered because it's nothing.

209
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:29,205
Since this is our last vacation,
let's have some fun.

210
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:34,600
- Eat a lot, Ji Hyun.
- Yeah.

211
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,313
Thank you for your hard work everyone.

212
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,209
Aunt, if we sell more books
let's go on vacation.

213
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:41,897
Just eat your sushi.

214
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,955
I'll just drink from my own cup.

215
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,641
Work hard.

216
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,341
Hello customer. I am from L-card, Kim Chun Hee.

217
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:30,786
I'm sorry for leaving so many messages
but I want to meet you and apologize.

218
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:34,251
If you're okay with that, please call me back.

219
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,351
I'll be waiting.

220
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:39,585
I'll leave my cell phone number.

221
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,726
Please call me back.

222
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,841
Please.

223
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:57,747
I think I'm going crazy.

224
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,889
What should I do!

225
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,370
What wrong with him now.

226
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:12,841
Director Im, Director Im.

227
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,374
What should we do?

228
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:16,712
Can you go home okay?

229
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,317
Wake up, Director Im. Wake up!

230
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:20,236
My gosh.

231
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:22,811
Boss.

232
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:27,815
I'm sorry I got carried away.

233
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,209
Do you know his house?

234
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,926
I don't know.

235
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,313
I can go alone.

236
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:35,708
Get a taxi.

237
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:40,381
No, I told you I can go.

238
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:41,377
I'm fine.

239
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,611
I'll be the first one at the office tomorrow.

240
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:46,849
Don't worry.

241
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,089
I'll get you a taxi, okay?

242
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:54,530
Forget it. I'm sure he can find his own house.

243
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,829
You can go too, Ji Hyun.

244
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:01,758
Aunt, how can you be so heartless?

245
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:05,260
Hey, do you think that using
the company's computer,

246
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:09,261
To play games or fill out
his bank papers is a good thing?

247
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,300
I want him to be good
at work not be good to me.

248
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:16,990
"Boss, please take this shot"
I wonder what's going on his head.

249
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,706
Don't you think something
is going on with him?

250
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:25,496
He seems very out of it.

251
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:46,186
Why won't you pick up.

252
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,608
Hello?

253
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,149
Hello?

254
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:56,999
Hello?

255
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,000
<i>What?</i>

256
00:18:58,685 --> 00:18:59,880
Customer?

257
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,394
Hello?

258
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:04,473
<i>Where is this place?</i>

259
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:08,489
Excuse me, can you put someone else on?

260
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,190
<i>Where is this place?</i>

261
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:12,377
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

262
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,446
Don't hang up.

263
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,021
Hello? Hello?

264
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:22,699
Why won't you pick up again?

265
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:47,799
How can I find you?

266
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:35,956
Are you...

267
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,223
Excuse me...

268
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:02,618
Excuse me, are you guys
by chance the event winners?

269
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:03,867
Yes.

270
00:21:03,944 --> 00:21:08,997
Us too. They sent alcohol in place of our
names, so do you want to get together?

271
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,010
Okay

272
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,486
- I'm Ma Ji Won.
- I'm Byun Hyung Tae.

273
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,770
You drink fast.

274
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:29,817
Let's do it again.

275
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:35,564
Here.

276
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,246
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

277
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:43,039
Honey, let's just drink one glass.

278
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,928
Okay.

279
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:47,880
Actually, we came here to make a baby.

280
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:49,306
You're crazy.

281
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:51,650
Please understand if we bother you.

282
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:54,961
We've been married three years
but there was no news.

283
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,785
So we're determined this time.

284
00:21:58,169 --> 00:21:59,227
What's wrong.

285
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,836
Why? It's nice to see.

286
00:22:00,974 --> 00:22:04,039
Are you two dating? Married?

287
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:07,452
We're just friends.

288
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:12,000
"Just friends" sharing one room?

289
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,506
Yeah, only after 30 years
of friendship, it's possible.

290
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:17,487
Then are you...?

291
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:18,866
Gay?

292
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,732
I've heard that many times hanging with her.

293
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:33,860
Ah, I regret it now.

294
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,135
Just forget it. It was nothing.

295
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:40,813
Can we talk, laugh and eat?

296
00:22:43,277 --> 00:22:45,316
I don't think I'm special enough.

297
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:55,787
Those gays don't even talk
and just drink. I'm so bored.

298
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:59,618
Yeah, why don't they just go in?

299
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:07,139
I want to get in the pool
with you and look at the stars.

300
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,116
I think you're crazy.

301
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:16,452
Why is my heart beating so much?

302
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,872
Hey... they're leaving.

303
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,846
The pool. Tonight?

304
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:40,520
Okay.

305
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:31,962
What do I do?

306
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,031
What do I do?

307
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:37,526
Are you okay?

308
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,377
What do I do?

309
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:57,180
Stop looking back at me.

310
00:24:57,257 --> 00:24:58,974
I'm not following you.

311
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,393
Ah! I see.

312
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:04,784
So you live in this neighborhood?

313
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:08,140
If you're that worried, I'll go ahead.

314
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,095
Good night.

315
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,400
Where's your house?

316
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,216
Where's your house?

317
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:31,940
Where are you going?

318
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:33,626
Where is your house, ahjussi?

319
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:36,888
Ahjussi, where is your house?

320
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:40,459
Where is your house?

321
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,951
Ahjussi.

322
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:00,145
Ahjussi!

323
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:08,298
Ahjussi, do you know where that man lives?

324
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:12,483
You want to start dating?

325
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,939
Yes.

326
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,836
You said your heart was beating.

327
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:23,620
It is but I'm not sure why.

328
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:31,007
Maybe I'm nervous or maybe
I'm scared to hurt your feelings.

329
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:38,698
Maybe I'm lonely or desperate,
so I want to lean on someone.

330
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,683
Is it because I like you?

331
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,660
Sometimes I do feel like
you're more than a friend.

332
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:49,184
But can I trust that feeling?

333
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:51,299
Actually I don't know either.

334
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:56,859
I have no idea where our friendship ends
and where it becomes more than that.

335
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,195
It might be a temporary thing
that will just pass by.

336
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:03,366
What if we fail at dating?

337
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:06,861
Our families know each other.

338
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:11,117
And we went to same school all our lives.

339
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:15,495
Same friends same social life.

340
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:23,696
If I lose you, I'll lose my whole life too.

341
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:25,060
Let's just end there.

342
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:26,378
Is it that easy?

343
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:28,095
I can't live without you as well.

344
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:30,584
So why did you tell me how you feel.

345
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:35,366
If you get married to that guy,
then it'll be too late.

346
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:46,460
If you don't want to, then we don't have to.

347
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,820
I'm fine if you blow me off.

348
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:51,329
It's nothing.

349
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:54,731
But I still love Jung Joo. A lot!

350
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:55,957
I know.

351
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,803
Is it okay to date even when you know
all about me and Jung Joo?

352
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:08,325
I heard it all since your first boyfriend.

353
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:10,363
Crazy...

354
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,796
I didn't forget about Sung Ah either.

355
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,084
I know.

356
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:17,516
Can you not take this so seriously?

357
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:20,796
You're not serious either, right?

358
00:28:20,857 --> 00:28:21,700
Yeah...

359
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:25,221
Are you that scared?

360
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:29,635
It's because I failed
so many times at dating.

361
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:34,371
You know how hard it is to recover.

362
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:38,657
I just lost my last relationship.

363
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:42,897
And I'm scared I might lose you too.

364
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:47,663
Since when?

365
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,303
I don't know.

366
00:28:54,456 --> 00:29:01,394
When I saw your love kindle,

367
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:06,447
I wanted to have it,

368
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:09,956
and wanted to give also.

369
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:22,548
What should I do?

370
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:30,792
What should I do to start dating you?

371
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:33,720
Huh?

372
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:36,616
Let's see.

373
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,624
Hey! Don't laugh.

374
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:46,907
Okay.

375
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:53,181
First of all, close the curtains.

376
00:29:53,303 --> 00:29:56,031
Hey! Hey, what are you doing now?

377
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,720
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

378
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:09,544
That couple tries way too hard.

379
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:19,547
Honey, look there.

380
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:21,310
I told you.

381
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,685
It's true.

382
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:25,862
How can boy and girl be just friends?

383
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,674
What was the bet we made before?

384
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:36,870
If they're lovers, we'll have a boy, if they're really
gay, girl, and if they're really friends then nothing.

385
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,446
I wanted a girl.

386
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:42,614
Shall we get together?

387
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:45,220
Together.

388
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:10,503
You really wanted to do this?

389
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:14,396
You wanted to hold mine that day too, right?

390
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,809
How'd you know?

391
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,127
Doesn't it feel like we're doing
something bad behind our parents?

392
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:26,172
I remember they fought when we were young.

393
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,012
You're the one that said to keep it
a secret yet you told your mom.

394
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,714
You bastard.

395
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:35,346
I don't care as long as I'm next to you.

396
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,129
Is this the appropriate conversation at age 30?

397
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:45,895
It should be 17 at max.

398
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:58,395
Is this for real?

399
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,794
Just tell me whenever
you feel uncomfortable.

400
00:32:02,912 --> 00:32:05,027
I'll pretend that we're
getting Civil Defense training.

401
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,269
I'm not going to sleep with you.

402
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,031
I wouldn't even if you wanted to.

403
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:21,709
I don't want us to do it
because we're lonely and sad.

404
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:37,793
Lie down, lie down.

405
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,702
What the heck is that?

406
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:32,261
Did you guys eat?

407
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,627
Eat.

408
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:48,838
This place is disgusting.

409
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:32,059
Did you guys?

410
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,525
Was my mother here?

411
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:50,590
Hey! Hyungnim.

412
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:01,889
Who was she?

413
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:03,130
Huh?

414
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,092
There was a lady yesterday night.

415
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:09,093
She cleaned your room
and left the door open.

416
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,293
A girl?

417
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:14,316
Did you see her?

418
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:15,343
Who was she?

419
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:17,795
Stop acting like you don't know.

420
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:32,435
Cha Mee? Ee Seul?

421
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:39,025
Can you tell me what happened last night?

422
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:44,073
I don't think she fell from the sky.

423
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,622
It's so good. It's been so long
since I had homemade cooking.

424
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:01,666
I'm not even going to poo this out.

425
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:11,914
Where should we go?

426
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:13,876
Ride motorcycle?

427
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,592
Should we ride around the beach?

428
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:16,681
Hey, Guys.

429
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:18,474
Good morning.

430
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:22,302
I knew you two were together.

431
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:27,437
It's not like that.
Did you guys have breakfast?

432
00:36:27,513 --> 00:36:28,142
Nope.

433
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:29,562
Then do you want to hang with us?

434
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:31,416
Should we? Are you okay?

435
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,807
Ok then. We'll be right back.

436
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:35,171
Let's go.

437
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,252
Excuse us.

438
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,028
You always liked hanging in groups.

439
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,530
Why? You don't?

440
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,522
No, I'm good.

441
00:36:55,743 --> 00:36:57,031
What?

442
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:02,131
Why are there so many messages?

443
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,613
From the subway.

444
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,490
Did you sleep well?

445
00:37:41,022 --> 00:37:41,635
What?

446
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,263
You were really drunk yesterday.

447
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,623
How do you know that?

448
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,309
Well I...

449
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:55,379
Were you the one that cooked the food?

450
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:59,149
And clean my room?

451
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:02,015
Well you wouldn't pick up your phone.

452
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:05,859
Phone?

453
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:09,292
You know my number?

454
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,261
Who are you?

455
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,202
I'm sorry.

456
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,712
Excuse me, what are you doing?

457
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,543
Did I do something wrong?

458
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:28,407
I'm from L-card Kim Chun Hee.

459
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:29,741
What?

460
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:39,418
What?

461
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:41,242
I'm sorry for intruding.

462
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,506
You should be sorry.

463
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:49,157
I should be riding with Nan Hee. What is this?

464
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:50,736
Oppa! Hurry!

465
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:21,077
You should walk barefoot.
It makes you feel good.

466
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:34,430
<i>Take you shoes off. It feels good</i>

467
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:35,855
<i>Alright, wait.</i>

468
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,763
<i>Nan Hee, can you film this?</i>

469
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:41,204
<i>Okay.</i>

470
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:05,003
You're not taking them off?

471
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:07,270
No, I like it like this.

472
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:12,971
Nice picture.

473
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:14,350
Here.

474
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:33,446
<i>It's so pretty. Looks like a painting.</i>

475
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:36,204
<i>Nan Hee, aren't you going home?
You're not busy?</i>

476
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:03,233
<i>You left without goodbye.</i>

477
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,325
<i>This is the phone you used while in Korea.</i>

478
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,410
<i>I'll keep it on for you.</i>

479
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,278
<i>Until you come back.</i>

480
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:27,707
I chose some but you should
visit them first then choose.

481
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:33,987
Here's the list so look them over in the plane.

482
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:40,501
Thank you very much. Did you tell my boss that
I want a good amount of free time in Korea?

483
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:45,681
Just how long do you plan to stay there?

484
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:50,370
I don't know. Only this phone
knows that how long I will stay.

485
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:59,339
So do you know what he did?

486
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,062
I don't remember.

487
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:03,641
Of course, you don't.

488
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:07,212
People often forget their own faults.

489
00:42:07,474 --> 00:42:10,156
Anyways, I was drinking with his girlfriend.

490
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:12,624
So naturally, he should take his girlfriend home.

491
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:15,320
But still how can he drop
me off in a subway and...

492
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:18,321
leave me with a black bag tied
on my ear in case I vomit,

493
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:20,281
Because I was so drunk.

494
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:21,001
Really?

495
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:22,564
You're in for it tonight.

496
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,333
Of course. If it was you, you'd be dead.

497
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:26,237
And then?

498
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:26,896
Then?

499
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,230
Did you vomit in that bag?

500
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,839
Of course I did.

501
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:31,525
I drank a lot that night.

502
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,550
When my mother saw me
with the bag she beat me.

503
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:36,297
I'm really sorry.

504
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,738
It's too late now.

505
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,515
It already left a scar here.

506
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:42,427
I don't want to date you.

507
00:42:42,837 --> 00:42:44,323
Oh my goodness.

508
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:47,741
Here, honey.

509
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:50,422
You too.

510
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:53,564
Love shot.

511
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:26,195
So I was on break from army service.

512
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:28,233
I remember this.

513
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:30,195
You do?

514
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,669
We were supposed to meet.

515
00:43:33,823 --> 00:43:36,995
So I went to our promised meeting
place but she didn't come.

516
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:37,915
Stop.

517
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:38,773
Go on.

518
00:43:38,845 --> 00:43:41,144
Guess who she was seeing?

519
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:45,236
I can't forget his name, Ma Bong Joon,
same major as you.

520
00:43:45,404 --> 00:43:46,891
The guy who looks like a fish.

521
00:43:46,968 --> 00:43:47,872
Stop it.

522
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:52,120
She told me in detail how that date went.

523
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,975
You guys talk about that stuff?

524
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:58,787
Hey, you crossed the line now.
Are you crazy? Stop it.

525
00:43:58,998 --> 00:44:05,603
What's important is that I was going
to tell her how I feel that day.

526
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,001
The cafe was closing, so I had to leave.

527
00:44:09,062 --> 00:44:10,871
Your phone is off, what was I to do?

528
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:14,176
I waited all night but she never came.

529
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:18,820
Even more important thing is that
it was a really hot summer day.

530
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:23,536
That's my little poor story.

531
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:25,457
You win.

532
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:53,819
Please standby.

533
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,493
Is she ready?

534
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,581
Ready?

535
00:44:58,703 --> 00:44:59,408
Yes.

536
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:16,970
Wait a minute. She has to change her shoes.

537
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:36,722
What are you staring at?

538
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,127
Just  thinking about this and that.

539
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:53,125
What?

540
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:55,332
I really didn't know.

541
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:04,554
The next day, when I was coming home
while thinking "my mom's going to kill me".

542
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:09,121
I saw you in front of my house
and I felt really bad.

543
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:14,691
The first thing you said while looking
half shocked and half nervous was...

544
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:21,396
"Hyung Tae, my body isn't the same as
yesterday but why is the world the same?"

545
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,001
How embarrassing... seriously.

546
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:29,947
That was back when I was sophomore in college.

547
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,132
So it was before you met Sung Ah, right?

548
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:35,462
I met her after army service.

549
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,849
I should have gone to see you.

550
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:42,791
Why did I forget about that promise?

551
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,159
Because you were crazy over some other guy.

552
00:46:51,573 --> 00:46:55,821
I hope those two really get their baby.

553
00:46:57,837 --> 00:46:58,833
Yeah.

554
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,239
There is only one day left in our vacation.

555
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:03,956
Let's go fishing tomorrow.

556
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:07,527
When I go back I feel like
it's all going to be a dream.

557
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:14,802
This place feels like its floating
across a sea of time.

558
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,476
You have pretty feet.

559
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,440
Really?

560
00:47:23,237 --> 00:47:25,536
Yeah, it's real pretty.

561
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:13,840
What about this?

562
00:48:14,162 --> 00:48:14,836
It's pretty.

563
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:21,396
Wear it tonight.

564
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:23,925
It's not crazy.

565
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:29,221
Let's stay far away from the pool tonight.

566
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:34,907
Why don't you choose one?

567
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,873
I just wanted to buy it for you.

568
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,038
It's okay.

569
00:49:08,357 --> 00:49:09,660
<i>Hyung Tae.</i>

570
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,085
<i>What?</i>

571
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:17,047
<i>Don't you think we know too much
about each other to be dating?</i>

572
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:38,683
Should we end it here?

573
00:49:41,465 --> 00:49:47,871
I don't think I'll ever be
great as Sung Ah to you.

574
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,456
I'm scared to go any further.

575
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:56,222
It's going to be a big mess
when we go back.

576
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:59,517
Let's just end it here.

577
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:06,196
It's still okay to recover, right?

578
00:50:09,537 --> 00:50:10,487
Of course.

579
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:14,596
What about your feelings?

580
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:16,773
I told you it's nothing.

581
00:50:17,907 --> 00:50:21,968
If I didn't say anything then
I was afraid it'd grow stronger.

582
00:50:22,664 --> 00:50:23,982
I'm done now.

583
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:31,982
That's why I tagged along to come here.

584
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:37,964
We can both say it was all
a dream when we're here.

585
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:49,277
We're still dating until we go back to Seoul.

586
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,503
Let me ask you a favor.

587
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:56,817
What?

588
00:50:57,537 --> 00:50:59,453
You have to completely forget.

589
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:01,844
Alright.

590
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:03,912
Everything.

591
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:05,598
Okay.

592
00:51:07,563 --> 00:51:12,830
You have to joke with me as we eat
together at home like you did before.

593
00:51:14,853 --> 00:51:17,413
When I'm shaving, you brush your teeth.

594
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:21,116
Sleep where ever you feel like.

595
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,273
You too.

596
00:51:24,825 --> 00:51:27,644
Just wait and see how cool I can act.

597
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,077
You probably think it really was a dream.

598
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,430
What if we regret it?

599
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,025
Thank you.

600
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,437
Let's go.

601
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:34,664
So...

602
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,073
So...

603
00:54:36,886 --> 00:54:39,108
So, so, so, so...

604
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:40,969
What do you mean so?

605
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:45,046
It was all just a summer dream.

606
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:49,000
You seem pretty cool about it.

607
00:54:49,845 --> 00:54:52,090
When the city dust touched my nose,

608
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:57,091
Reality and my heart beat
came back to normal.

609
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,730
There's no problem.

610
00:55:00,052 --> 00:55:05,539
If you two can stay away from each other
for about one month I'll believe you.

611
00:55:05,692 --> 00:55:11,439
But when you're living in the
same house it's a different story.

612
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:27,468
Why? Aren't you going up?

613
00:55:56,208 --> 00:56:01,434
<i>Does it make sense that two people,
who were kissing just 12 hours before,</i>

614
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:05,603
<i>Constantly bumping into each other
and eating, showering,</i>

615
00:56:05,687 --> 00:56:10,561
<i>Sleeping together in the same space
be comfortable and safe?</i>

616
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:11,825
<i>It makes sense.</i>

617
00:56:19,928 --> 00:56:23,101
I forgot my cell phone in the car. I'll be back.

618
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:24,797
Oh! Okay.

619
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:28,797
This is crazy.

620
00:56:33,425 --> 00:56:35,448
Just date him.

621
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:37,287
Why are you hesitating?

622
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:42,110
Don't you feel anything when you
look at her desperate moves?

623
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:44,976
Is that Kyung Ha's trainer?

624
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,405
They're going to have a party now.

625
00:56:52,129 --> 00:56:54,106
Tell me the truth.

626
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,746
Can you...

627
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:57,585
I shouldn't have told you.

628
00:56:57,815 --> 00:56:59,102
Want to bet?

629
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:04,014
I'm putting my $230 dollars
that you two will be dating.

630
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:06,236
That's too much.

631
00:57:06,516 --> 00:57:08,370
You see that. I knew it

632
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:12,646
Hey! Why the heck is it
$230 dollars and not $200?

633
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:15,727
I have my eye on a mp3 player.

634
00:57:15,845 --> 00:57:17,378
Fine. Let's do it.

635
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,155
Awesome!

636
00:57:19,692 --> 00:57:20,994
You'll regret this.

637
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:26,037
There is a saying that goes like this.

638
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:30,972
A guy's love ends in physical contact...

639
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:35,677
and a girl's love begins with physical contact.

640
00:58:00,698 --> 00:58:02,384
That number is still available.

641
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:03,411
Oh really?

642
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:06,920
Is there a way to know when
this number disconnected?

643
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:08,683
We don't know.

644
00:58:11,543 --> 00:58:13,550
Then can you just give me that number?
