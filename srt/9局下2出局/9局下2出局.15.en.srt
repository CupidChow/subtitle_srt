<i>The 20 years history of Korea's professional baseball.</i>

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:13,013
<i>There are a total of 758 players that have retired.</i>

4
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:17,195
<i>Amongst them, there are only 126 players
then have been victorious 10 times and above.</i>

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,607
<i>One time victory, there are 431 players.</i>

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:29,514
<i>The rest of the 327 players left the playing field
without even winning a single round.</i>

<i>15th Inning >
Thank you all you super stars</i>

8
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:10,944
Why?

9
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:13,784
Oh nothing.

10
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:31,932
What's up exactly?

11
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,717
Sorry.

12
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:38,140
Hold on.

13
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:48,982
We, can we change another place?

14
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,646
I have a feeling that, someone is watching us.

15
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:57,290
Nan Hee?

16
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:03,759
Both of you, are you really just friends?

17
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,308
In this house.

18
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:11,183
In here.

19
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:16,001
Did you have anything going on with Nan Hee?

20
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,513
What does that mean?

21
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,590
Hyung Tae.

22
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,720
Nothing that you imagine happened.

23
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,030
Even if it happens,

24
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,146
I won't mind.

25
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,564
Now the one you love is me.

26
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,410
That is enough.

27
00:02:54,516 --> 00:03:00,235
Even if something did happen,
that was when I wasn't around.

28
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,725
That period of emptiness,
it was my fault entirely.

29
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:09,581
I won't mind.

30
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,889
It's not what you think.

31
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,707
Thinking about it carefully,

32
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:19,139
A man and woman share a house,
but nothing happened.

33
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,678
It is really scary.

34
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:29,859
Only if both parties treasure each other immensely,
then it can be achieved.

35
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,868
Hyung Tae.

36
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:41,481
This house, can we change it bit by bit?

37
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:50,488
I feel that there is too much
of Nan Hee's shadow here.

38
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,796
Oh.

39
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:56,794
Okay.

40
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:03,080
This is driving me crazy.

41
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:05,937
Why can't I fall asleep?

42
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:37,155
[Safety latch]

43
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:02,872
In this house,

44
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:04,998
in here,

45
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,092
Did you have anything going on with Nan Hee?

46
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:10,939
Nothing that you imagine happened.

47
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,349
Even if it happens,

48
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:17,422
I won't mind.

49
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:25,424
Now the one you love is me.

50
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,417
That is enough.

51
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:53,937
Oh!

52
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:57,544
Poop!

53
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,981
The feeling of a chance meeting
is really something new too.

54
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,905
Why can't you sleep and
are out gulping soju?

55
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,262
Who is gulping?

56
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,662
I am only drinking it sip by sip.

57
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:31,032
Aren't you curious what
feelings do I have today?

58
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:34,896
Is the refrigerator still functioning?
Didn't you say that the sound coming from it was too loud?

59
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:37,051
It has already been repaired.

60
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:41,133
The repairman said considering that it was
a second hand item, it was not that bad.

61
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:46,355
When the repairman came in,
did you leave the door open?

62
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:52,914
Do you know how my day today was?

63
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:54,804
How is it?

64
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,620
I worry if your refrigerator was working well.

65
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:03,600
Thinking of the safety latch in your house
that wasn't very good.

66
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:08,197
So I went to the supermarket to get one.

67
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:12,647
When I got home and entered in the security code,
I suddenly felt that you'll be standing by the door like old times.

68
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,482
Striking a fighting pose.

69
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:22,998
Nan Hee.

70
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:24,347
Oh?

71
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:30,503
We...

72
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,859
What about us?

73
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:42,643
We...

74
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,380
Are we really friends?

75
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:50,225
Of course we are friends.

76
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,721
Why?

77
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,494
Sung Ah asked me,

78
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:15,398
But I, couldn't answer at all.

79
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,805
Actually I,

80
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:27,798
Can't treat you as a friend anymore.

81
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,566
How can you say something like that?

82
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:37,818
You came out with all plans to match-make me.

83
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,780
The times that we been through are too precious.

84
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:49,708
So I am trying very hard to compliment
and suit your actions as well.

85
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,589
But I can't do it.

86
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:59,900
I have already expressed my feelings.
To take it back, it is easier say than done.

87
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:03,383
Whether it is to you or Sung Ah,

88
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,748
I am hurting the both of you.

89
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:11,668
I hate myself for doing that.

90
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:19,358
I keep using the excuse of friendship
to keep you by my side.

91
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:26,170
Because if I don't do that,
I won't be able to see you.

92
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:29,297
Then,

93
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:35,319
When you say this, you are prepared
to not see me ever again?

94
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:43,146
You decide.

95
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:46,802
Whether if I can see you.

96
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:49,928
Anyway, I am tired out.

97
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,569
What decision can I make?

98
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:55,951
I don't have a choice anymore.

99
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,998
Isn't it?

100
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,603
- Sorry.
- Enough.

101
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:12,167
Finally, it still has to be this way.

102
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:20,077
I said that life has no feeling of ups and downs.

103
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,047
I have really been played on a joke.

104
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:31,403
How is this problem going to be resolved?

105
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,796
In my life, if I didn't have you, dear friend,

106
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:42,797
How am I going to adapt to that?

107
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,387
My soju bill, you help me pay it.

108
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:55,267
I am going.

109
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,412
<i>The tears doesn't stop</i>

110
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:09,689
<i>But the time stops and doesn't go</i>

111
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:17,300
<i>You say you are very happy</i>

112
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:24,381
<i>Letting me go, but you are smiling
and saying thank you</i>

113
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:31,581
<i>You are afraid that saying you loved me will hurt me.</i>

114
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:35,127
<i>Only saying thank you</i>

115
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:39,254
<i>Wishing that I meet a better person</i>

116
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:44,004
<i>Stay, I am not in time to say</i>

117
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:48,520
<i>I wasn't in time to get near to you</i>

118
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:55,098
<i>I always get choked up and can't say a thing</i>

119
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:58,631
<i>Thinking of you so much I can't breath</i>

120
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:02,957
<i>Until the state that I forgotten what to say</i>

121
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:06,878
<i>You loathe the foolish me</i>

122
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:11,381
<i>So you are leaving me</i>

123
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:25,915
That is a stalker.

124
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,327
Now you should call the police.

125
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:30,669
Why should I call the police?

126
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:34,204
You don't know how much this flower comforts me.

127
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:39,581
Unconsciously, there is someone is taking note of me.

128
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,801
Doesn't it make one feel comforted?

129
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:45,099
Careful you might get cheated.

130
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:49,628
I say, since there is someone taking notice of you,
shouldn't you be more careful?

131
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:52,469
Manager Hong.

132
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,421
Yes?

133
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,204
So Woon.

134
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,736
He is really agreeing to the
cooperation based on this price?

135
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:58,725
Yes.

136
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,710
I only casually gave a low price.

137
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:02,314
Unexpectedly, he agreed.

138
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,898
Where did this sudden fortune fall in from?

139
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,792
But his other requests are a lot.

140
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,651
Could it be, he fallen for you?

141
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,479
He is someone with a wife.

142
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,333
Where did he arrange to meet
with you to discuss the work?

143
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:19,065
In the work room.

144
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,418
Director Im.

145
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:24,729
Next time when Manager Hong goes to
meet So Woon, you accompany her there.

146
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:25,679
Me?

147
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:29,648
This...

148
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,797
Is it so...?

149
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,556
Definitely not.

150
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,774
Nan Hee.

151
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:04,418
You are staying near by too?

152
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,233
You can't bear to live a little
further from him, right?

153
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:13,201
Why did you come out personally to shop?

154
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,452
I came with Hyung Tae.

155
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,368
Is this your style?

156
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,499
He was the one who allowed me to pick anything.

157
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:27,737
It is not changing the shampoo,
but you're thinking of changing the whole house?

158
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,526
The season has changed too.

159
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,890
You can just say it straight
that it was because of me.

160
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:35,847
I heard that the atmosphere that I left behind,
it has made you uncomfortable.

161
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,765
That is part of the reason too.

162
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:55,369
Both of you can shop slowly.

163
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,682
Did two of you quarrel?

164
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:06,181
No.

165
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:28,981
If he was going to be like this, why did he want me
to live in the same neighborhood as him?

166
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:47,238
It's only a few days, and she already wants
to eliminate all the traces I left behind.

167
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,345
She's so bad.

168
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,373
Hyung Tae.

169
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,589
What are you doing?

170
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:39,669
Oh.

171
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,605
I am curious about something.

172
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,340
Say it.

173
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,641
You, when did you delete my number?

174
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,891
When was it exactly?

175
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,454
We...

176
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:05,860
Regarding the time when we are apart,
can we not talk about it?

177
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,520
You said that what was important is now.

178
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:11,508
Okay.

179
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,340
<i>Taking a step closer,
I am getting farther by a step</i>

180
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:50,462
<i>I am sick and tired of you
retreating while I am advancing</i>

181
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:55,018
<i>{\a6}If you like someone, just say it</i>

182
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:55,018
Nothing.

183
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:59,010
<i>Let's not waste our efforts anymore</i>

184
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,585
<i>My love</i>

185
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:07,867
<i>Why are you being like this</i>

186
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,666
<i>Why are you treating me like this</i>

187
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:19,153
<i>Why do you always make me anxious</i>

188
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:21,833
<i>You know exactly where my heart is</i>

189
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,733
<i>If you continue to be this way</i>

190
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,120
<i>If you are continuing to be like this on purpose</i>

191
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:33,036
<i>Me who is just looking at you</i>

192
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:40,865
<i>Just loving you, my heart will change too</i>

193
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:45,396
<i>Taking a step closer, I am getting farther by a step</i>

194
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:50,618
<i>I am sick and tired of you retreating
while I am advancing</i>

195
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:54,917
<i>If you like someone, just say it</i>

196
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:59,305
<i>Let's not waste our efforts anymore</i>

197
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,100
<i>My love</i>

198
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:05,836
<i>I am not a guy whom you get to meet often</i>

199
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:09,604
<i>Once I get into a relationship</i>

200
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:14,784
<i>I will love only one girl</i>

201
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,664
<i>That sort of a foolish guy</i>

202
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:24,712
<i>It seems that I have fallen for you,
I have fallen in love with you</i>

203
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:29,762
<i>Once I think of you,
my heart is not the same</i>

204
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,352
<i>If you like someone, just say it</i>

205
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,305
<i>Let's not waste our efforts anymore</i>

206
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,668
<i>My love</i>

207
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:44,028
<i>I love you</i>

208
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:50,914
<i>I love you</i>

209
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:57,284
Hello?

210
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,574
Hello.

211
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:08,175
Please say something.

212
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:14,880
Who are you?

213
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:18,493
If I continue to be silent,
are you going to cry?

214
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:21,431
Why are you playing a trick on me?

215
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,774
Looks like you are waiting for a call.

216
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:26,701
What?

217
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:29,792
My heart hasn't been beating
like this for a long time.

218
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:32,874
Before, the incoming number wasn't shown.

219
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:36,953
Hence when a call came, you would
wish that the caller was someone.

220
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,525
If the opposite party doesn't say something
and just hangs up, you'll be making wild guesses.

221
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,707
Saying that it is definitely him.

222
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:43,996
Where are you?

223
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:47,212
I am on my way off work.
Feeling a little empty, so I called you.

224
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,309
<i>You got off work so late?</i>

225
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,282
Oh. A little.

226
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:51,558
Oh! That's right.

227
00:20:51,593 --> 00:20:54,078
We are going to your house this weekend, right?

228
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,018
You said that you will give
a treat when you moved.

229
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,507
Oh, that's right.

230
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:03,332
<i>But, I am very curious,
whose call are you waiting for?</i>

231
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:04,955
Hanging up.

232
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,878
I'm hanging up.

233
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:30,492
Nan Hee.

234
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:53,060
When I think of your suggestion,
I think that it's quite right and I'm thankful.

235
00:22:55,983 --> 00:23:01,372
No matter who I go to a match-making session with,
I can't meet a better guy than you.

236
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:11,625
Hyung Tae...do you have feelings for him?

237
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:17,767
Since things have come so far,
there can't be any good ending.

238
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:21,879
I know I should forget it.

239
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,442
But if I am to start a relationship with you
in the current situation I am in now,

240
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:31,378
Us two, we will just hurt each other.

241
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,181
Might as well start over with someone new.

242
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,907
That way is better.

243
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:46,027
Why does he keep hurting you?

244
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:48,669
Might as well give him a good punch.

245
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:55,428
<i>Director, you are too much.</i>

246
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:58,596
Hey, why do you keep saying I am too much?

247
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:02,709
Hyung Tae and I, the work load allotted
to the both of us, the difference is too much.

248
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:05,454
Hey, shut up and come with me.

249
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,561
Always let me...

250
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,634
Really too much.

251
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,181
Director, do you want me to do it?

252
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,844
You better do well what you have to do.

253
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,067
There are too many things to do,
but I have a lot of time too, I can't stand it.

254
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:17,561
What are you saying?

255
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:19,818
Everyday is too long.

256
00:24:19,853 --> 00:24:21,360
So disgusting.

257
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:22,833
Okay, you go.

258
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,383
This fella is too disgusting, I can't bring him.

259
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:27,059
Sir, please leave well, take care.

260
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:29,509
You, you, wait and see. You...

261
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,431
Hyung Tae, thank you.

262
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:32,841
Take care.

263
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:34,466
Jerk.

264
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,880
Marriage?

265
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,786
Of course it is good.

266
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:53,564
That gal, if I don't want her,
who else can she go with now?

267
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,975
Still objecting?

268
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:02,475
Hey, is divorcing such a great sin?

269
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:06,947
In order to retain my pride
I put up a high up attitude.

270
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:10,480
Forget it if she doesn't want to
marry off her daughter to me.

271
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:14,801
It's me that is too bad.

272
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:15,903
Is it?

273
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:16,971
Yes.

274
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:22,829
You know, she really likes kids.

275
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:27,536
She really wants a child.

276
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:33,629
But, unknowingly, she has already reached 39.

277
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,600
I gave her many chances.

278
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,010
Even released her, let her run off from my side.

279
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:45,223
In the end, she dated lots of guys.

280
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:52,477
What if Chief Yoon really leaves you,
can you still survive?

281
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,567
Can't live on.

282
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,158
Yes.

283
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,647
It should be so.

284
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,352
We have been together for 10 years already.

285
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:09,432
Who else can replace her?

286
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,827
Drink up.

287
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:04,192
Oh, it's Yoon Sung Ah.

288
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:07,598
Yoon Sung Ah, hello.

289
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,294
Yes, wearing a chilli jacket.

290
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:13,972
Why are you so cute?

291
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,351
I don't know what to do with you.

292
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:29,402
Aren't you going in?

293
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:35,978
The weather is great.
Let's stay here for a bit before we head in.

294
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,897
- When did you arrive?
- Just now.

295
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:54,354
Recently, is it because of me,
you are shortening your practise time?

296
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:55,284
No.

297
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,205
My daily schedule, someone is in charge of it.

298
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,091
I have long not being make decisions myself.

299
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,789
Ah.

300
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:04,260
Why?

301
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:06,152
You are worried about me?

302
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,727
Looks like I have nothing to worry about.

303
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:16,282
Reeks of alcohol.

304
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:24,750
Come in.

305
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:26,738
When did you arrive?

306
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,256
Much earlier on.

307
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:30,432
- Very clean.
- Not bad.

308
00:28:32,422 --> 00:28:34,079
So cute.

309
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,402
Living alone...

310
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:42,895
I don't know if everyone can fit in.

311
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,296
I brought fried rice vermicelli.

312
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,450
We bought beer.

313
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,743
Thank you.

314
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:52,928
- Present.
- Present?

315
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,210
Radio?

316
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:59,551
You really made it?

317
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:02,411
So pretty.

318
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:04,843
Chun Hee.

319
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:06,544
I will make yours.

320
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,211
I am learning now.

321
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,051
Really?

322
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:20,244
- Do eat more.
- You prepared so much.

323
00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:22,168
Looks delicious.

324
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:32,251
But, isn't there such a phrase,
a useless superior is worse than the enemy.

325
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:36,738
Just a few days into work and
he is already talking like this.

326
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:38,295
Let him be, Mi Kyung.

327
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:42,297
He must show off at suitable times,
it brings meaning to earning money.

328
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,129
Chun Hee, you are the one amongst us
with the most experience.

329
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:50,649
You have worked for 10 years already, right?

330
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:51,875
Me?

331
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:54,546
It is a little troubling on others.

332
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:58,689
Once I see a lazy junior, I feel terrible.

333
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:01,796
Although they are lazy, but when it affects
their interest, they become smarter.

334
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:03,263
I hate it when I see it.

335
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:06,348
To Sung Ah, this must be very unfamiliar.

336
00:30:06,694 --> 00:30:08,767
I know that by saying this I will get a scolding.

337
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:10,110
But I envy all of you.

338
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:12,976
Superior, junior, colleagues.

339
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,332
A work environment, is it not?

340
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:19,661
I knew that I will be chided by all of you.

341
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,268
You guys.

342
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:29,118
What is love?

343
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:32,658
This is a topic that we talk
about in school last time.

344
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:33,988
Why are you still talking about it now?

345
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:35,565
So mushy.

346
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,574
Why?

347
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:37,720
Tell her.

348
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:39,139
Love.

349
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:43,480
It can only be protected if you don't lose yourself.

350
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:45,919
Greed.

351
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,220
Living.

352
00:30:47,255 --> 00:30:49,913
Looks like once you get married,
love becomes very simple.

353
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,728
It becomes more profound, you are too much.

354
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:55,898
What about you, Sung Ah?

355
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:56,648
Me?

356
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,025
Concert.

357
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,200
Why?

358
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:08,237
Because if you don't give it your best, you will fail.

359
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:11,823
Nan Hee?

360
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,812
Timing?

361
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,050
You?

362
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:27,927
Pass.

363
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:29,911
Quick answer.

364
00:31:29,946 --> 00:31:32,286
Rascal, say what is love.

365
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:34,365
Hey! Hey!

366
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,889
<i>Even though living is hard</i>

367
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:41,482
<i>Even if I fall in love</i>

368
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:46,474
<i>But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

369
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,093
<i>{\a6}This is the beginning</i>

370
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,093
It looks so pitiful to leave you alone behind.

371
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:52,893
<i>{\a6}The star of life is me</i>

372
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:52,893
Quickly, go.

373
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:57,380
<i>{\a6}Don't forget, who you are</i>

374
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:57,380
See you.

375
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:06,381
We're going.

376
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:07,582
Take care.

377
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,544
<i>It's okay</i>

378
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,078
<i>Don't worry </i>

379
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:17,147
<i>It's suppose to be hard for everyone </i>

380
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:20,656
<i>After one night's sleep </i>

381
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:24,368
<i>Everything will be fine again </i>

382
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:28,531
<i>I don't know how to give up</i>

383
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:32,219
<i>I'm fine and strong </i>

384
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:39,973
<i>Always cheerful and happy
I will patiently endure it</i>

385
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,689
<i>I believe
Even though living is hard</i>

386
00:32:42,724 --> 00:32:44,558
<i>Even if I fall in love </i>

387
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:48,392
<i>I will never cry
or complain </i>

388
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,174
<i>This is the beginning</i>

389
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:53,358
<i>The star of life is me</i>

390
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:55,519
<i>I never don't cry</i>

391
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:57,675
<i>Sad tears goodbye </i>

392
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,499
<i>Hard worries goodbye</i>

393
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:03,331
<i>The beautiful day that I have
imagined last night, here I come</i>

394
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,459
<i>Today is the beginning </i>

395
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:09,020
<i>I am going to do well</i>

396
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:11,984
<i>Smile again.</i>

397
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:15,568
Greed.

398
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:16,571
Living.

399
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:17,539
Concert.

400
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:19,480
Timing.

401
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:21,367
And, pass.

402
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:25,273
You are suddenly concerned about love.

403
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:29,556
Hey, why did Hyung Tae say pass?

404
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,095
I roughly know why.

405
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:32,905
What is it?

406
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,253
Because someone has already said
the answer he wanted to give.

407
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:42,745
Could it be really because of that?

408
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:45,186
Makes people so curious.

409
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:47,545
Chun Hee.

410
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,887
Why can I see even this sort of things?

411
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,075
Don't you think I will be very tired?

412
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,787
What's up?

413
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:56,609
Hold on.

414
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:58,072
Hand!

415
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:00,335
What happened? What happened?

416
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,381
Hey, are you going to close
that door just like that?

417
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:05,988
I was just thinking of opening the safety latch.

418
00:36:06,412 --> 00:36:07,226
It hurts?

419
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,865
Of course it does!

420
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:20,816
Do you need my help anywhere?

421
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,007
Your hand is already hurting,
how else can you help?

422
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,241
It will be fine, right?

423
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:27,662
Hurts a lot?

424
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,737
Do you want to go to the
hospital for a check-up?

425
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,456
Just a minor injury,
why the need to go to the hospital.

426
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,531
Why is your reaction so retarded?

427
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:36,430
Once I get anxious.

428
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:39,431
I thought you were going to close the door.

429
00:36:54,637 --> 00:36:56,238
Do it yourself.

430
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:07,490
Why did you come?

431
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:10,419
How are you doing?

432
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,357
Didn't you ask that question just now?

433
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:22,777
The announcement date for the selection
of the essays is just a few days away, right?

434
00:37:22,812 --> 00:37:23,527
Oh.

435
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:27,914
Curious if you are doing well.

436
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,635
Very.

437
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:33,133
Hey.

438
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:35,984
How come you didn't ask who's
at door before opening?

439
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:39,854
This girl really have the guts.

440
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,293
What exactly do you want?

441
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,302
Could it be you forgot what you
told me at the streetside food tent?

442
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,693
Didn't you say you can't be
friends with me anymore?

443
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:56,138
But what are you doing here now?

444
00:37:57,592 --> 00:38:01,258
If we can't even be friends,
do you feel that inside it is a little empty?

445
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:03,864
Missing me? Worrying about me?

446
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:07,750
Every time you feel like that,
you would just barge in anytime.

447
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,417
Are you going to keep treating me like a dog
who needs to be fed and just leave like this?

448
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:13,551
When Sung Ah is upset, you are concerned.

449
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,379
When my heart is hurting, you act indifferent.

450
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,895
You are such a joke.

451
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,618
You can only think of it as like this?

452
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:28,162
Then what should I think it as?

453
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:30,795
You have prepared to break off with me,
hence you said those words.

454
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:33,440
But I don't have any preparation, and just lost
the times that we have been through together.

455
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:37,865
I tried ways and means to protect those times,
but you ruined time in just a few moments.

456
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,386
I said before,

457
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:46,345
Losing you, is as good as losing my whole life.

458
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,967
You think that there will be no sense of lose?

459
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:55,077
If it was not unbearable, I would not have said that.

460
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:57,504
You think that my feelings are different from yours?

461
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,965
Did I take you for a little puppy every time?

462
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,007
When have I ever hurt you and,
yet felt happy and free?

463
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:08,065
Do you know why I came?

464
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,756
If I didn't come to see you,
I will go crazy, so I came.

465
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:14,182
I didn't think that much. Uncontrollably, I came.

466
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:17,350
Not wishing to worry about you,
but still I am, hence I came.

467
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:19,847
Without you at my side,
I am so lonely I am going crazy.

468
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:23,723
You are living a new life in a new home.

469
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:28,974
But me, did you ever think of me
that you left behind and how I felt?

470
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:34,874
I lost my directions, I'm at a lost of what to do.

471
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,667
That's right.

472
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,054
I am lacking a lot.

473
00:39:40,256 --> 00:39:42,294
But don't you feel anything?

474
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:46,197
How can you be so rational in everything you do?

475
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:50,984
You only think about yourself getting hurt.

476
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:54,383
You didn't think that you've hurt me too?

477
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:58,240
When you left and pushed me aside,
you said want to be friends.

478
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,845
You think that liking you,
I don't feel any pain at all?

479
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,839
You think that living under one roof,
I have an easy time controlling myself?

480
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:13,040
In order not to ruin our relationship,
do you think I never put in any effort?

481
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:18,965
What?

482
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:22,573
If I came to feed a dog?

483
00:40:23,574 --> 00:40:24,324
Okay.

484
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:29,606
I got it.

485
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:32,733
I will not come again.

486
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,291
Oh, that!

487
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,404
It should be today, right?

488
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,822
I know.

489
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:24,858
But the flower was not delivered.

490
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:27,234
I know it wouldn't be sent here.

491
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:32,936
That means to say, you knew much early on
who is the one sending them.

492
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:37,635
Could it be, you two have met?

493
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,574
Did you keep in contact after that?

494
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:45,863
I am waiting for such an important phone call
that no man can compare to.

495
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:48,672
What is that?

496
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,697
Gave me a fright.

497
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:55,190
Oh, we have got the notice too.

498
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,934
For all the efforts that has been put in,
the result is a little small.

499
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:01,046
Although it is the same holding, but the concert
and album are going to be promoted differently.

500
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:02,716
Adjust it after the meet up.

501
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:04,668
But the meeting ground becomes a problem.

502
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:07,803
Can you not squabble with me
over these small matters?

503
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,423
My life's motivation steams from those.

504
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,830
I will go to your company.

505
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:29,747
<i>The essay selection's announcement
on September 10th.</i>

506
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:31,748
<i>Results can be viewed on the
cultural daily paper or website.</i>

507
00:42:33,688 --> 00:42:36,448
If the individual was selected,
will they inform the person?

508
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,057
Heard that, one or two days before,
they will be informed.

509
00:42:39,277 --> 00:42:41,715
In order to give a speech,
they have to have a little preparation.

510
00:42:41,964 --> 00:42:42,714
Oh.

511
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:50,201
Did you happen to hear any news?

512
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:56,034
All these years, I never thought such a day would come.
You are actually asking me regarding news of Nan Hee.

513
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:58,461
If you didn't hear anything, then never mind.

514
00:42:58,986 --> 00:43:01,330
Don't torture Nan Hee anymore.

515
00:43:04,027 --> 00:43:07,333
If you can't be responsible, then why
are you still asking news of her?

516
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:19,899
Let's have a game.

517
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,869
Do you take Nan Hee as a safety net?

518
00:43:41,904 --> 00:43:43,366
Shut up, play your game.

519
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,898
Holding on to one of her legs for your whole life.

520
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,629
Not letting go but not holding it up.
What are you up to?

521
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,156
When other guys surface besides Nan Hee,
you get so anxious.

522
00:43:54,694 --> 00:43:57,847
When the person disappears,
you act as if nothing happens.

523
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:02,255
Do you think she will stay
by your side your whole life?

524
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:12,384
When she suddenly disappears
from your side, you feel uneasy?

525
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,202
You have Sung Ah by your side,

526
00:44:16,203 --> 00:44:20,203
but you are afraid of losing Nan Hee,
so anxious your heart is on fire.

527
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:26,224
What do you know!

528
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:30,916
Why did you have to make me
say these out, you jerk.

529
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:43,952
You rascal.

530
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:47,278
How well do you know me?

531
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:59,029
Hello.

532
00:45:01,955 --> 00:45:05,139
Yes, I have found a place.

533
00:45:05,456 --> 00:45:07,248
Yes.

534
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:09,975
What are you looking at?

535
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,424
I was thinking, I used to be like her once.

536
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:19,798
This is the first accounting bill.

537
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:22,775
It has been already deposited to you account.

538
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,788
When you look at your account balance,
you will have a sense of achievement.

539
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,527
In our company, you got such a huge...

540
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,945
It will not only be this.

541
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,055
The first accounts bill is only this much money.

542
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,041
I can tell roughly how much the future ones will be.

543
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,898
I have already planned what is
to be written for the next book.

544
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:43,470
Want to hear it?

545
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:45,327
You want to continue working with us?

546
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:46,884
Didn't you say it was one time cooperation?

547
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:48,645
What? What?

548
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,813
Let's hear it?

549
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,946
The topic is...

550
00:45:53,342 --> 00:45:55,687
Can you give me a pen and paper?

551
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,902
Quick, take it out.

552
00:45:57,937 --> 00:45:59,119
Quick.

553
00:46:26,361 --> 00:46:29,866
<i>A road trip on a bus towards happiness!</i>

554
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:34,160
It can be used for the title too.

555
00:46:34,195 --> 00:46:36,595
Using my handwriting for the lettering.

556
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:38,453
This...

557
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:39,991
It doesn't have any feelings.

558
00:46:40,026 --> 00:46:41,988
If Manager Hong has feelings,
that is sufficient.

559
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:43,557
I don't have any feelings too.

560
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,252
You two are...

561
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:47,973
I want to write a story about handicaps.

562
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:52,934
Author Shin, you can write on that sort of topic?

563
00:46:53,474 --> 00:46:57,803
I don't mean to scorn at you,
but you are of such a young age.

564
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:04,040
Using this sort of inappropriate
content to provoke the readers.

565
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:06,342
I will write it well.

566
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:09,120
I understand their world.

567
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:12,147
I also want to live like her.

568
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:14,353
A confidence which stems from no where.

569
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:19,486
My brother met with a car accident 5 years ago
and became a handicapped person.

570
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,410
Don't look at me with that sort of look.

571
00:47:24,982 --> 00:47:32,208
What sort of stares you are giving me,
all will be written in the book.

572
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,604
My brother is a baseball player.

573
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:40,430
He longed to run on the jade green grass.

574
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:42,503
I understand that very well.

575
00:47:42,538 --> 00:47:47,419
But now, how he has found his happiness,
I will write it all out.

576
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,486
Hello.

577
00:48:05,936 --> 00:48:08,749
Yes, the house has been found.

578
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,480
Author Shin.

579
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:15,193
We, let's have something to eat?

580
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:16,419
Treat me for a drink.

581
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:17,922
This child, she just at the slightest occasion...

582
00:48:17,957 --> 00:48:19,829
The level test, I have passed it.

583
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,866
Bravo.

584
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:26,306
Furthermore, with ahjummas
as my guardians, I can drink.

585
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:29,536
Ah... ahjumma.

586
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:32,207
Ahjussi doesn't need to go then?

587
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:36,615
Call Author Lee along too.

588
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:39,333
Okay, let's call Author Lee along too.

589
00:49:02,123 --> 00:49:05,487
Tomorrow is the presentation.

590
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:18,276
Get up, rascal.

591
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:21,061
Didn't you arrange to have dinner with Sung Ah?

592
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:43,901
I say this child.

593
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:47,264
She earned 21 times of what I earned,
just on one books.

594
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:50,702
But we also treasure Author Lee all the same.

595
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,091
Boss Jang.

596
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:57,171
We can only sigh when we see youth, right?

597
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:59,138
I have long lost the energy to sigh.

598
00:50:01,035 --> 00:50:02,980
Author Shin, you can't drink.

599
00:50:03,214 --> 00:50:04,871
Let's go out to dance.

600
00:50:04,906 --> 00:50:06,676
You go ahead.

601
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:09,981
Me, if I'm not careful, my hip will get hurt.

602
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:14,907
Don't stare at the phone already.

603
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:18,313
The literature society has long got off work.

604
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:19,504
It should be so.

605
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:21,048
Even if you give a call,
you won't know the results?

606
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:22,205
Oh.

607
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:24,002
There is still tomorrow.

608
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:26,351
Today, let's jut have fun.

609
00:50:26,386 --> 00:50:27,293
Let's have a game.

610
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:28,378
What game?

611
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:29,429
Yes, or no.

612
00:50:29,464 --> 00:50:30,773
Okay.

613
00:50:31,258 --> 00:50:32,150
Okay.

614
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:33,274
If it is a yes, it is the back of the hand.

615
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:34,363
If it is a no, it is the palm of the hand.

616
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,168
The minority will drink up.

617
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:38,890
Okay. I will start first.

618
00:50:40,368 --> 00:50:45,215
In the past month, did you ever kissed.

619
00:50:58,236 --> 00:50:58,686
Okay.

620
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:01,092
Then I shall start.

621
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:05,545
There is a kid around, I am embarrassed to say.

622
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,743
What is it?

623
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,989
Then?

624
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:11,428
Let's put the water level a little lower.

625
00:51:12,015 --> 00:51:12,836
Can't be bothered.

626
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:14,448
Crowd around.

627
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,848
You really dare to say anything.

628
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:22,180
Whatever you say and didn't say, I heard it all.

629
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:26,181
1, 2, 3.

630
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:31,988
Looks like you are still quite brave.

631
00:51:34,503 --> 00:51:36,336
Just this bit of matter,
what is there to talk about bravery.

632
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:37,591
Okay.

633
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:39,526
I will start.

634
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:43,871
I am now loving someone.

635
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:46,672
1, 2, 3.

636
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:56,228
Manager Hong.

637
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:18,192
Fought with 17 people?

638
00:52:18,227 --> 00:52:19,635
Just you two?

639
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,580
It is nothing much.

640
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:25,248
During our school days,
30 is also not a problem.

641
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:29,470
If you two could maintain that sort of chemistry level,
my concert will be a huge success.

642
00:52:30,735 --> 00:52:32,111
You are inviting us to dinner because of this?

643
00:52:32,293 --> 00:52:34,635
Choosing which company is my chief's decision.

644
00:52:34,854 --> 00:52:36,456
But it is my concert after all.

645
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:39,748
Treating you both for a meal,
hope that you two will take care of me.

646
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:41,020
Practise?

647
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,614
After eating dinner,
I will go home to practise.

648
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:48,532
From tomorrow onwards, I'll be very busy
practising and will have no time to see you.

649
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:52,095
But you are actually causing trouble
on the outside, I feel so unsettled.

650
00:53:30,336 --> 00:53:32,792
<i>Is the preparation for the concert going smoothly?</i>

651
00:53:32,827 --> 00:53:34,756
Good, like so.

652
00:53:36,085 --> 00:53:39,993
<i>Heard that you found a house in Korea.</i>

653
00:53:40,028 --> 00:53:43,762
<i>After the concert, you are not
intending to return to Spain?</i>

654
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,950
Maybe.

655
00:53:46,915 --> 00:53:49,469
<i>Okay, I got it.  Goodbye.</i>

656
00:53:49,948 --> 00:53:51,935
Goodbye.

657
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:46,422
Sorry.

658
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:48,426
I have caught a cold.

659
00:54:49,906 --> 00:54:51,218
Yes.

660
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:53,345
I got it.

661
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,252
Yes.

662
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:21,502
<i>Flowers facing the sky</i>

663
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:28,391
<i>But I am looking at you</i>

664
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:31,849
<i>In my heart, I keep propagating</i>

665
00:55:32,294 --> 00:55:40,029
<i>When we are together,
we are hidden from the fact</i>

666
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:44,612
<i>Like the minute and the second hand</i>

667
00:55:44,952 --> 00:55:47,590
<i>Can you see my tears?</i>

668
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,034
<i>Can you hear my voice?</i>

669
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:54,186
<i>Don't be too late</i>

670
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:59,560
<i>Come over to hug me who is crying</i>

671
00:55:59,782 --> 00:56:01,188
<i>There is only one</i>

672
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:06,601
<i>In this world there is only one</i>

673
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:10,002
<i>That can let me smile</i>

674
00:56:10,249 --> 00:56:13,015
<i>Now I know</i>

675
00:56:13,294 --> 00:56:15,485
<i>Now is it still a little awkward</i>

676
00:56:15,858 --> 00:56:19,107
<i>Although we don't have any pulsating feeling</i>

677
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:21,998
<i>The one who believes me</i>

678
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:27,110
<i>The one who watches over me</i>

679
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,204
<i>I will watch over you</i>

680
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:34,251
<i>Let's not let go together</i>

681
00:56:35,198 --> 00:56:36,398
<i>I love you</i>

682
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,318
<i>Can you see my love?</i>

683
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:46,818
<i>Can you hear my voice?</i>

684
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,990
<i>Don't be too late</i>

685
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:55,054
<i>Come over to hug me who is crying</i>

686
00:56:55,418 --> 00:56:57,059
<i>There is only one</i>

687
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:02,175
<i>In this world there is only one</i>

688
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,771
<i>That can let me smile</i>

689
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:05,951
<i>Now I know</i>

690
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:10,202
<i>The number that you dialled is unavailable.
Please leave a message after...</i>

691
00:57:23,418 --> 00:57:25,963
You have completely fallen ill.

692
00:57:26,448 --> 00:57:28,189
Just a cold.

693
00:57:28,854 --> 00:57:31,388
You should rest at home if you are ill.

694
00:57:31,423 --> 00:57:33,765
From now on, this is my home.

695
00:57:34,513 --> 00:57:36,483
Why are you still bringing this here?

696
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:38,368
I know how to cook porridge too.

697
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:41,044
Do you know how sad it is to be ill and alone?

698
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:45,209
Mom, you are just close by,
what am I sad about?

699
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:48,005
Hey, quick come over to eat the porridge.

700
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:02,107
Oh my.

701
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:04,938
Why not be totally sick?

702
00:58:05,556 --> 00:58:06,493
Right.

703
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:09,174
Eat this up, then afterwards go to sleep.

704
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:11,106
After you sleep, I will leave.

705
00:58:11,877 --> 00:58:12,627
Okay.

706
00:58:13,543 --> 00:58:16,745
This time you are not chasing me away?

707
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,075
Basking in a mother's love.

708
00:58:20,325 --> 00:58:25,016
In this sort of circumstances,
it is the only filial thing I can do.

709
00:58:25,353 --> 00:58:26,377
Oh gosh, really.

710
00:58:26,412 --> 00:58:28,402
Quick, eat up.

711
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:36,651
Oh, it's Kim Joo Hwan.

712
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:51,935
Hit one.

713
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:54,464
Please hit one.

714
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:57,394
You got to hit one.

715
01:00:03,113 --> 01:00:04,570
Hit!

716
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:27,320
He really hit one.

717
01:00:31,116 --> 01:00:33,744
Ms. Hong, you got to keep fighting too.

718
01:01:08,474 --> 01:01:09,225
Hello.

719
01:01:13,925 --> 01:01:15,012
Nan Hee didn't come?

720
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:17,279
Why?

721
01:01:17,314 --> 01:01:18,856
Where you two suppose to meet here?

722
01:01:19,855 --> 01:01:20,605
No.

723
01:01:22,777 --> 01:01:24,797
Sit, do you want to have soju?

724
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,300
Yes.

725
01:01:26,193 --> 01:01:33,143
<i>Yes, I have a dream</i>

726
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:37,575
<i>I believe in this dream</i>

727
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:42,519
<i>Please watch over me</i>

728
01:01:42,884 --> 01:01:49,434
<i>Standing cold-heartedly
in front of that fated wall</i>

729
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:52,150
<i>I can strongly face it</i>

730
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:57,235
<i>I can always go pass that wall</i>

731
01:01:57,627 --> 01:02:01,227
<i>I can fly high up into the sky</i>

732
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:05,159
<i>This heavy world cannot tie me up</i>

733
01:02:05,314 --> 01:02:09,364
<i>My smile will still be with me
until I reach the end of my life</i>

734
01:02:42,112 --> 01:02:46,309
<i>Taking a step closer,
I am getting farther by a step</i>

735
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,418
<i>I am sick and tired of you
retreating while I am advancing</i>

736
01:02:51,453 --> 01:02:55,573
<i>If you like someone, just say it</i>

737
01:02:55,608 --> 01:02:59,694
<i>{\a6}Let's not waste our efforts anymore</i>

738
01:02:55,608 --> 01:02:59,694
Hello.

739
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:01,635
<i>{\a6}My love</i>

740
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:01,635
Hyung Tae just left.

741
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:07,895
<i>{\a6}Why are you being like this</i>

742
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:07,895
He asked me if you came.

743
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,696
Give me a bottle of soju.

744
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:12,967
<i>{\a6}Why are you treating me like this</i>

745
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:12,967
Soju?

746
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:18,462
<i>Why do you always make me anxious</i>

747
01:03:18,497 --> 01:03:22,793
<i>You know exactly where my heart is</i>

748
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:27,207
<i>If you continue to be this way</i>

749
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:31,739
<i>If you are continuing to be like this on purpose</i>

750
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,865
<i>Me who is just looking at you</i>

751
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:41,563
<i>Just loving you, my heart will change too</i>

752
01:03:41,886 --> 01:03:46,196
<i>Taking a step closer,
I am getting farther by a step</i>

753
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:51,240
<i>I am sick and tired of you
retreating while I am advancing</i>

754
01:03:51,585 --> 01:03:55,662
<i>If you like someone, just say it</i>

755
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:59,902
<i>Let's not waste our efforts anymore</i>

756
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:02,100
<i>My love</i>

757
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:05,575
<i>I love you</i>

758
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,160
<i>I love you</i>

759
01:04:20,536 --> 01:04:22,844
What do you want me to do?

760
01:04:26,336 --> 01:04:29,581
Have you been standing here for a long time?

761
01:04:29,864 --> 01:04:33,318
From the time that you peeped into my car.

762
01:04:33,558 --> 01:04:36,326
Holding a tambourine and swaying about.

763
01:04:40,856 --> 01:04:42,610
Its hard on you.

764
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,783
Although you werent chosen.

765
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:51,993
<i>Even though living is hard</i>

766
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:54,714
<i>Even if I fall in love</i>

767
01:04:54,944 --> 01:04:59,508
<i>But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

768
01:04:59,807 --> 01:05:01,977
<i>This is the beginning</i>

769
01:05:02,287 --> 01:05:05,727
<i>The star of life is me</i>

770
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:10,020
<i>Don't forget, who you are</i>

771
01:05:23,603 --> 01:05:25,817
<i>I believe
Even though living is hard </i>

772
01:05:25,852 --> 01:05:27,722
<i>Even if I fall in love </i>

773
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:31,432
<i>I will never cry
or complain</i>

774
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:33,330
<i>This is the beginning</i>

775
01:05:33,365 --> 01:05:36,496
<i>The star of life is me</i>

776
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:38,649
<i>I never don't cry</i>

777
01:05:39,037 --> 01:05:40,691
<i>Sad tears goodbye</i>

778
01:05:40,942 --> 01:05:42,691
<i>Hard worries goodbye</i>

779
01:05:42,726 --> 01:05:46,505
<i>The beautiful day that I have
imagined last night, here I come</i>

780
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,416
<i>Today is the beginning</i>

781
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,043
<i>I am going to do well </i>

782
01:05:52,946 --> 01:05:54,379
<i>Smile again</i>

783
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,909
<i>But I still have you</i>

784
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,651
<i>Will smile again today</i>

785
01:05:57,972 --> 01:06:01,422
<i>Always by my side, my precious friend</i>

786
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,800
<i>Fly up higher</i>

787
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:07,288

<i>Why do you want to work with me again?</i>

796
01:06:29,754 --> 01:06:33,254
I really need Manager Hong's help.
