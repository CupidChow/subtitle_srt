00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:06,673
Brought to you by WITH S2
Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,181
Why are you so frightened?

3
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:22,461
Didn't you tell me you had a ghost stuck on your back?

4
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:25,031
You still said that you were communicating
with ghosts the whole day?

5
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:28,052
9, 10, 11...

6
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:32,350
The appearance looks a lot like a farmer.

7
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:37,805
Following along with a witch like you,
I am unable to identify the convict.

8
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:40,726
But seen so many ghosts.

9
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:48,847
Quickly, let's do the exchange and leave well.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,311
The road to travel is still long.

11
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,176
Get up.

12
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:58,056
All of them are probably holding sickles* and
will try to attack us with them. (*sharp hooks)

13
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,505
I've heard of some people being
frightened to death by ghosts.

14
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:05,213
But I have not heard of people
getting killed by sickles.

15
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,549
You still think that Mr. Kim Jang Shik's
death was caused by humans?

16
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:15,677
Isn't it your wish to put the blame all on the vengeful ghosts?
Anyway, they are vengeful ghosts.

17
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,705
I wish so too.

18
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:23,405
But they, are not vengeful ghosts.

19
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:39,100
Being together with a woman who communicates to ghosts,

20
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:40,837
could it be that I heard hollow noises?

21
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,837
A female is looking at you.

22
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,002
Female?

23
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,226
Yes.

24
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,809
Pretty?

25
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,809
You still have the mood to joke around?

26
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,401
Regardless of whether you ring the bell
or do the dances, quickly kill her.

27
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:55,741
If you wish to reach the village...

28
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:59,876
They are saying something but I don't understand.

29
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,876
It's not the Joseon* language. (*Korean)

30
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:34,729
What is going on?

31
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,315
I already said they are not ghosts.

32
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,865
Didn't I say it already; it's not done by humans.

33
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:28,210
"Didn't I say it already; it's not done by humans."

34
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,480
<i>That color looks very red.</i>

35
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:35,150
The traces of white which were left where they walked.

36
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:40,122
After a while, it will disappear.

37
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:44,173
Ah, won't do. Won't do.

38
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:47,820
Some intense feelings should be added in here.

39
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:52,773
Ah, why won't it do?

40
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:29,204
5th Inning:
30... The banquet has ended.

41
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,468
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

42
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:56,131
Regarding this free-styling way,
what do you think of it, Department Chief?

43
00:04:56,154 --> 00:05:00,048
Lousy, lousy, this is too superficial.

44
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:01,865
I knew you would say that.

45
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,327
Ah, why? Isn't this fresh and new.

46
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:06,750
Cars exclusively made for women are going to be marketed.

47
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,729
Of course it has to be eye-catching!

48
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,434
Have a look, it's not bad.

49
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:17,404
With regards to this project, I can foresee what
President Kim will say before he even thinks about it.

50
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:19,896
Hey, Hyung Tae, you know that too. Have a look.

51
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:22,912
This... eye-catching advertisement.

52
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,488
Once the hot and sexy models come out, it is a goner.

53
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,234
Asking you to sell cars, not do artistic works.

54
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,853
<i>How come you like to show that off so much? Really.</i>

55
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:37,059
<i>Department Chief, you are using the client as an
excuse on purpose, picking on faults right?</i>

56
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,381
<i>Quick accept it, if not I am going to yell.</i>

57
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:44,467
<i>Because Department Chief is always like that,
hence we came up with some minor changes.</i>

58
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:48,005
<i>Every time we come with the same cases,
who wouldn't get sick of it?</i>

59
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:50,005
<i>You... are really...</i>

60
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:54,788
<i>I say, the car's color is an art.</i>

61
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,493
<i>But the advertisement can't use art.</i>

62
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:58,470
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

63
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:01,089
<i>A questionnaire form.</i>

64
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,922
<i>You look nervous.</i>

65
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:13,407
<i>Are you courting death?</i>

66
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,103
<i>I finished it two days in advance, praise me.</i>

67
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,039
<i>Why don't you wait for the meeting to be over
before you give it to me?</i>

68
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:29,803
<i>This way is more exciting.</i>

69
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,117
<i>Fooling around.</i>

70
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:36,382
<i>Of course I have to.</i>

71
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,803
<i>After I have confessed my love, I was dumped.
You keep avoiding me, how will this do?</i>

72
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,690
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

73
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,690
<i>Why are you laughing like a fool by yourself?</i>

74
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:58,830
It's an undeniable fact that small cars
are good assets to have in stock.

75
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,691
The value of these cars would be important.

76
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,565
Yes, of course.

77
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:05,554
Who was the one who brought is one down?

78
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07,877
I will be the one who understands
the President's wishes better.

79
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,341
This wouldn't do.

80
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:14,126
Can you think of something more sellable?

81
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:18,838
Ji Sun, you can go home first, aren't you going
for the organization entry exams tomorrow?

82
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:22,063
Yes, I'll be leaving then.
Good luck to everyone.

83
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,055
Ok, thank you for your hard work.

84
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,667
Isn't she a nakasan*?
(*a person who got the job through connections)

85
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,667
What is the use of the examination?

86
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,275
Whatever the case, she will enter the organization.

87
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:35,834
Isn't life like that?

88
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:41,103
<i>Ah, seriously. I hate working at this advertising
company when something like this happens.</i>

89
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,063
<i>What is there to be troubled about?</i>

90
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,916
<i>You write proposals everyday,
in a year, can you get 10 million?</i>

91
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:52,531
She? Just on her name card alone,
is already worth 10 million.

92
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,155
This proposal, just keep it first.

93
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,893
It is not very suitable with the main theme,

94
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:59,194
furthermore, the advertisement itself
may become the main attraction point.

95
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,042
Recently, this is also one point not to be missed.

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,648
That's right.

97
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,065
Believe us this once, Department Chief.

98
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:09,020
I also... became very famous
because of what I've accomplished.

99
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,715
You are really formidable.

100
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,830
Using the consumers as the main focus
to shoot a short film how is it?

101
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:15,125
This sort of drama, everyone is sick of it.

102
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:19,527
Not saying that we have to keep hinting to them to buy,
just like a story board.

103
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,285
Oh, that is good.

104
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:24,786
The customers needs are all different.
Hence, a general foundation...

105
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,175
It's too eye-catching.

106
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:31,560
Furthermore, this is the first ad that the boss's
daughter is handling after taking over as manager.

107
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:35,263
That's right. Every time, the same thing is done,
of course she might not like it.

108
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,549
How old is the manager?

109
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:39,645
Thirty-nine.

110
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:42,076
A woman aged thirty-nine.

111
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:48,706
An age where there's nothing to be afraid about in
this world, only abide by her own laws and rules.

112
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:52,696
Department Chief.
You are saying this for me to hear?

113
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,696
You are 39?

114
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:56,696
Yes.

115
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:00,532
Look young for your age.

116
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,868
<i>You don't have the courage to fall in love?</i>

117
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:30,610
<i>What is to be done?
My love has just started only.</i>

118
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,418
I'm eating ramen now.

119
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:03,386
Can you stop asking me if
I have had my three meals?

120
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:05,382
Are you my wife?

121
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:08,606
What have you turned my pure and innocent gesture into?

122
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:10,562
I don't like that too.

123
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,650
I already said that meal relations are very scary.

124
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,122
We must have become really close while eating
meals together for one or two months.

125
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,317
What do you mean by that?

126
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:20,646
When I think of you being hungry,
my heart will start to ache.

127
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:26,100
My maternal instinct is caring for Jung Joo, but
I must had extra room to care about you too.

128
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,821
If there is extra, you can try the challenge
of producing a new athletic generation.

129
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,782
Don't eat ramen.

130
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,160
I know.

131
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,697
There is some rice.

132
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,749
I've prepared some snacks for you just
in case you get hungry again at night.

133
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,749
I got it.

134
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:53,020
Is there an addiction for nagging?

135
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,976
Hold still, don't move.

136
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:14,507
The smell of perspiration is great.

137
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,912
Ah, you're embarrassing me.

138
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:34,552
Let's see Noona try throwing.

139
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,589
I don't know how to.

140
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,519
I will teach you.

141
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:46,856
Lift your leg.

142
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:49,505
1, 2, 3.

143
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:56,317
Lift your leg.

144
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:59,105
1, 2, 3.

145
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,686
You hit it well.

146
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,375
Punk, such good stamina.

147
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:12,850
I should just ride my bike next time.

148
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:15,466
Why did I even bother to run?

149
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:00,431
I knew it.

150
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,856
She forgot to switch it off again?

151
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:10,891
You are like this every time.

152
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,429
I'm really going crazy,

153
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:24,255
still treating her like a woman.

154
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:40,731
Those that I have to admit, I still have to admit.

155
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:43,169
Miss Hong is still a woman.

156
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,587
Hey, what did you do to me?

157
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:58,498
The morning wind is chilly.

158
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,857
Right.

159
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:05,200
That's right, a few nights ago,
didn't you wake up screaming?

160
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,745
Yeah.

161
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:10,823
Then, did you really dream about
the days when you were in the army?

162
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:14,958
Of course. I dreamt of the army.

163
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:18,377
Packed by bags, running with the troop. Why?

164
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:22,033
No, you should be yearning for women right?

165
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,480
You should be rightfully dreaming of a romantic scenario.

166
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,912
You, you take men too... that...

167
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:32,453
Anyway, that dream is really something.

168
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:33,887
What?

169
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,101
<i>It is a forecasting dream.</i>

170
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,965
Okay, good.

171
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,538
According to this, our friendship will be abnormal.

172
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:51,833
What?

173
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,650
It was on the danger line for a while.

174
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,594
What are you saying?

175
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,261
There was that incident.

176
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,716
Useless fellow.

177
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,654
You didn't dream about wining the lottery,
but you dreamt about getting ready for military training?

178
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,923
Who are you laughing at?

179
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,299
You, now you have a lot of spacebar
imprints on your head, very obvious.

180
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:13,578
During this critical time in which your work of writing is
at stake, you spent all night pressing the space bar?

181
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:17,773
Let's... go die.

182
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:19,449
Do you want bread or rice?

183
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,405
Bread.

184
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,037
What?

185
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,037
Long time no see.

186
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:39,892
You left so early in the morning and
came back when I fell asleep already.

187
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,262
It's so difficult just to have a look at you.

188
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,161
That is to say there is not much time left to.

189
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:47,571
Then, will it be always so late?

190
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:48,779
Why?

191
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,565
I don't wish to eat alone.

192
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:57,727
Alright, let's eat!

193
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,096
Hyung Tae, take your army uniform here,
I'll help you iron it.

194
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,249
How embarrassing, it's only for joining in the
army preparation exercise, why must it be ironed?

195
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:20,918
It's also not to go see a loved one.

196
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:24,379
I want to iron it, iron it really neat and straight.

197
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,355
Nan Hee.

198
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,026
Let's eat YubuChobap*.
(*vinegared rice stuffed in fried bean curd)

199
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:32,839
Why YubuChobap all of a sudden?

200
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:35,258
Oh, there naturally is a reason.

201
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,554
How is it? I made this myself. Is it nice?

202
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,625
There's nothing he can't eat.

203
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:59,204
Let's eat together.

204
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,089
It's mine.

205
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:05,255
Not letting me to eat makes me wanting it more.

206
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,491
You rascal, you have to understand there
are certain things in this world you can't get.

207
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,656
Recently, I keep meeting you.

208
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:39,513
Right.

209
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,305
Oh sorry, did it get to you?

210
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,305
It's alright, nothing, nothing.

211
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,305
Hold on.

212
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:56,220
This is Hyung Tae's.
This is Jun Mo's.

213
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:57,991
You did a questionnaire too?

214
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,258
You too?

215
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:01,578
Both your questionnaires arrived at the same time.

216
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:03,130
But this is interesting.

217
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:04,021
What?

218
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,534
Besides filling in the personal particulars,
there is not even a bit of similarity.

219
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,899
Aren't you two doing the same advertisement?

220
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,009
Chun Hee, you... looks like you gave
Hyung Tae a bit more.

221
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:17,509
Yeah right!

222
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,890
It's not, both of you get fifty pieces.

223
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,072
I let my subordinates do a little,
didn't imagine they would do it so carefully.

224
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,543
Thank you very much, you must be tired?

225
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:30,520
Let's order something good.

226
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,655
- Excuse me...
- Hold on.

227
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:36,208
This is Jun Mo's. This is yours.

228
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:38,878
Ah, so sorry, almost made a big mistake.

229
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,752
So I say.

230
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,539
Hold on.

231
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,133
This is mine, right?

232
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,173
Aren't you two curious what is written inside?

233
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:49,773
- No.
- Which one is mine?

234
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:52,776
Nothing to be curious about.

235
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:56,364
Didn't think I could be a spy.

236
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:05,105
Anyway, if you want to get the information
you need, hand over the money.

237
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:09,288
Thank you for your treat.

238
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:10,665
Don't mention.

239
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,266
Really sorry.

240
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,643
- I actually wanted to treat today...
- It's alright.

241
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,786
Leaving the wallet in the car, that sort of stuff.

242
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:25,009
Lucky we are friends. If it were other people,
they will get the wrong idea.

243
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,677
If I'm successful this time,
next time I will give a big treat.

244
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,291
When that time comes, would you have to buy
beer for Hyung Tae to cheer him up?

245
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:35,371
Why are you two on the same note?

246
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:39,318
- Go ahead.
- See you.

247
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:44,476
Take some medicine, once you get sick,
it will drag on for ages.

248
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:45,711
Alright.

249
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:47,914
See you.

250
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,930
Hey guys...

251
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:58,451
I haven't breathe Yang energy for some time now.

252
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:03,252
My body hurts, my heart hurts too.
Can't you give me a hug?

253
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:05,252
Here?

254
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,252
Something wrong?

255
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:10,085
Here, come here.

256
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:21,400
Hyung Tae, what are you doing?

257
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,567
Hey, why am I hugging the back,
really spoils the mood.

258
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:38,432
Your problem is, your reaction is always slower by a beat.

259
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:43,108
Chun Hee, this is the time.
Give a sneeze.

260
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:47,145
Shut up and concentrate,
concentrate only on me.

261
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:51,229
Because of Jun Mo, I can't concentrate.

262
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:19,071
Oh? What's with the disappointed expression?

263
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,461
You, who are you waiting for?

264
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:27,567
This place, is it the place where
your someone waits for you everyday?

265
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:41,465
You scared me.

266
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:45,480
Stinking fellow.

267
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,813
<i>If I have the courage to start over again,</i>

268
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:02,516
<i>why can't you have the courage to forgive him? Why?</i>

269
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:13,188
Why did Chow Yun Fat go to Hollywood?

270
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:18,800
Still the black eyes are more suited to hold a double gun.

271
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,231
You, like that guy very much right?

272
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:27,003
Why don't you date him?

273
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:29,205
Given my circumstances,
what right do I have to date him?

274
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:32,466
Full of debt.

275
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,466
Head of the family.

276
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:40,983
But when he was chasing me everyday,
I didn't realize that.

277
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,755
After I saw him walk away,

278
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:45,509
how should I say it...

279
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,327
Regret?

280
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,139
No, it's not.

281
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,051
That sort of feeling.

282
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:52,456
Kim Chun Hee who picks up a phone call for consolation.

283
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:54,567
Kim Chun Hee who has full of debts.

284
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:57,262
The brave Kim Chun Hee, who is the head of the family.

285
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,528
That sort.

286
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,978
So?

287
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:06,464
But Kim Chun Hee the lady...

288
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:11,662
When the fellow is by my side,
I feel like I have become a woman.

289
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,535
Nan Hee?

290
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:20,533
How does a kiss feel?

291
00:24:24,502 --> 00:24:28,773
Once I reach thirty, the banquet is over.

292
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:41,310
<i>Chun Hee was always the first in school.</i>

293
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:46,136
<i>But because of family background,
she was unable to attend university.</i>

294
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:51,558
<i>On the day of graduation, it was the first and the last time
that Chun Hee cried because she felt sorry for herself.</i>

295
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:55,900
<i>Her sorrowful cries, till now are still a vivid memory.</i>

296
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:23,060
<i>But then, how could you say that
the banquet has ended Chun Hee?</i>

297
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:27,664
<i>Your banquet, till now, hasn't even started.</i>

298
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:57,530
What are you doing?

299
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:02,481
Why do you keep treating me like this?

300
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:08,131
That ahjumma is really irritating.

301
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:09,800
Who?

302
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:11,860
All because of you!

303
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:15,280
Since I gave her flowers, she's been giving me suspicious
glares and bothering me to go on a matchmaking date!

304
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:16,400
What?

305
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:17,980
That ahjumma is really strange.

306
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:21,560
What's her business to know
what kind of man I'm living with?

307
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:23,527
She actually wants you to go for match making?

308
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,736
How can there be such people?

309
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:28,266
You too, stop sleeping on the sofa.

310
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:30,755
Do you live here alone?

311
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:33,871
Summer days.

312
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,895
We better be more careful, ok?

313
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:37,270
Why?

314
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:38,984
Catch a cold?

315
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,984
Oh, so bothersome.

316
00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:44,874
Did you waste your life living to this age?

317
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,723
What is this for?

318
00:26:57,652 --> 00:26:58,973
Hello.

319
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,973
Oh, mom.

320
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:02,973
What? Supermarket?

321
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,584
How is it, Mom?

322
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,202
Ah, this is quite nice.

323
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:13,237
But, this I can't afford.

324
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,871
Forget it, just buy it.

325
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,229
Mom!

326
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,107
Hello everyone!

327
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,107
Hello, Department Chief.

328
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:28,107
Hello.

329
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,850
Did you let Ji Sun do OT over night?

330
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,850
No, why?

331
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:34,110
Nothing.

332
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:38,810
Ji Sun, why are you wearing the same clothes as yesterday?

333
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,273
You slept outside right?

334
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:44,074
Yes.

335
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,436
Department Chief, meeting time.

336
00:27:50,707 --> 00:27:51,988
Oh, okay.

337
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,566
I don't want to.

338
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,682
Do you know how much money I spent on you?

339
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,078
Did you see me spend money for nothing?

340
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:01,237
Who let you buy it?

341
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,461
Mom, didn't we agree, before I hand over the script,
you will not bother me?

342
00:28:04,496 --> 00:28:07,247
I agreed not to disturb you when you are writing,
I didn't say not to get you to go for matchmaking.

343
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,092
Can you just put the matchmaking aside?

344
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:12,097
The concern for me, just put it on work first okay?

345
00:28:12,142 --> 00:28:13,800
Because it is such a waste.

346
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:17,782
She said there's a fine young man in her area,
she couldn't stop praising him.

347
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:19,536
I need to go back now.

348
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,947
Just five minutes will do.

349
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,274
If that is the case, just give me the photo, that will do, mom.

350
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,411
Aren't you not photogenic?

351
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,866
Still you can't do that too.
I'm not a slave.

352
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,180
You're like taking me to sell in the market, doing my best
to doll myself, must it be like that to go for matchmaking?

353
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:36,636
Even if I'm taking you to sell as a slave,
you won't fetch a good price.

354
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:39,965
Mom.  I'm really...

355
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,895
You better watch, see what I write
on your grave the next time.

356
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,047
What will you write?

357
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:44,705
Just watch and see.

358
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,388
She should be coming.

359
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:52,292
I say, young people nowadays are really frightful.

360
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:53,168
Why?

361
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:56,897
Not married and start staying together already.

362
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,857
Now there are countless of people like that.

363
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:01,614
A lot.

364
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:07,172
Really worrying, that that sort of child
will become my daughter-in-law.

365
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,737
Why the sulky face?

366
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,281
Will this do?

367
00:29:17,307 --> 00:29:19,955
Ah, you rascal. Quick, go in.

368
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:23,721
Why isn't Kim Shin Ja here yet?
She should be here already.

369
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:25,268
Maybe there's traffic.

370
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:27,817
I'm going to the restroom.

371
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:35,378
Sorry we are late.

372
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:37,118
Quickly come in.

373
00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:41,307
We are having lunch together,
she wants give her greeting before leaving.

374
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,558
Hello.

375
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,168
My eldest.

376
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,168
So pretty.

377
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:48,795
She is a little big, as long as she is pretty, that will do.

378
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:53,110
But, how come I don't see Kim Soon Ok?

379
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:59,886
It is a small publishing firm.

380
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:04,169
She is a Korean language major, Cultural University.

381
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,022
You must have learnt well,
you look like a cultured person.

382
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,022
Thank you.

383
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,022
Do you want to drink papaya tea?

384
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:16,473
No, thank you, I still have something on. I have to get going.

385
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:18,725
Have a drink before you go.

386
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:20,357
Let's have two glasses.

387
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,500
Shin Ja.

388
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,694
My nephew is also single, do you want to
have a matchmaking session?

389
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:26,897
That is good of course. How old?

390
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:28,059
Forty.

391
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:30,998
He is also the problematic child in the family.

392
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:37,230
Although he is forty, he looks handsome and his
education is high. He also has financial strength.

393
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:41,662
There are no more drinks here,
let's have some refills.

394
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,048
Hello.

395
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:01,454
What?

396
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,017
Why?

397
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:06,485
Mom, I... need to excuse myself a while.

398
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:36,889
Sunbae! Sunbae!

399
00:31:36,922 --> 00:31:39,763
Don't hold her back, let her go.

400
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:43,292
You think there's no one else, but you?
Hey, go find Lee Myung Gi and tell him to come down here.

401
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:45,913
The case report was written in a mess and yet...

402
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:46,600
What are you saying?

403
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:49,292
What! What? What!

404
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:51,718
Let go.

405
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:53,093
Let go.

406
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:54,972
Just endure it.

407
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,874
Really...

408
00:31:57,727 --> 00:31:58,694
Sunbae!

409
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:00,854
Really...

410
00:32:03,064 --> 00:32:04,625
Noona!

411
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:08,690
Noona!

412
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:15,060
Why is everyone like this?
Tomorrow's the presentation already.

413
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:16,212
Take care.

414
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,954
We will be going first.

415
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,703
Bye.

416
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:22,938
Everyone says you are nice.

417
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:26,594
We might be able to set up three
matchmaking sessions for you.

418
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:28,594
Mom, I'm very busy now.

419
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:32,782
This girl...

420
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,389
Hye Soo wait for me...

421
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,135
Hurry. Take two steps at a time.

422
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:44,345
Why?

423
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:47,218
Unni, you don't have to be so courteous.

424
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:50,025
If I call you unni, it shouldn't be a problem right?

425
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:55,529
Are you really Author Shin Joo Young?

426
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:58,028
Looks like it is not.

427
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:01,007
I say, come see me a little later.

428
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:04,152
- No, it's not like that.
- This...

429
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:10,531
Actually, unni's words were too frank,
so I could not accept them at once.

430
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,727
But when I was editing it, I gave it some thought.

431
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,061
You are right, there is a lot of thought to it.

432
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:19,468
You still edited it.

433
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,423
For the previous incident, I hope you forgive me.

434
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:29,091
I really wish to collaborate with this company.

435
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,715
It's great.

436
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,433
The ending too.

437
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,133
It's so touching.

438
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,455
All because of unni.

439
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:44,455
How can it be?

440
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,815
Author Shin, I'm very sorry about last time,
I was too emotional.

441
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:54,168
It's I who was too much.

442
00:33:54,904 --> 00:33:58,527
Let's just forget it, since the script is already here.

443
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:02,063
But, the main character has become a baseball player?

444
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:06,339
Yes, height: 184. Age: 22, is a baseball player.

445
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,953
So alike to the player that I know, gave me a fright.

446
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:11,953
All my goose bumps are coming up.

447
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:15,802
Ah, really? That is great.

448
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:18,445
Can you let me interview him?

449
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:22,155
There is still some touching up needed. It's great.

450
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,806
Right. Then let's give him a call now,
we can meet him now.

451
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:27,806
Don't!

452
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:32,131
Why not? Why?

453
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:40,790
After this ache has vanished, then we'll meet.

454
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:46,750
Department Chief words are not wrong.

455
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,049
The case is a little...

456
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:51,224
Are there any good ideas?

457
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:59,300
Hye Soo Sunbae prefers these.
These are movies that are famous.

458
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:04,428
Kim Hye Soo Sunbae, the Marketing Director for G Motors.

459
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:05,775
You know the person?

460
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:10,134
Daughters from rich backgrounds,
they like to do little gatherings as well.

461
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,977
Our family is not some famous family name,
hence it is more difficult to get in there.

462
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:16,977
Really?

463
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:21,480
Can roughly understand what she likes.

464
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,387
Thank you.

465
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:28,094
And this too, a list of the books she likes,
travel sites, red wine etc.

466
00:35:28,146 --> 00:35:29,895
Will it be of any help?

467
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:32,930
Last night I spent the whole night talking to get it.

468
00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:34,510
Overnight?

469
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,566
Looks like you are interested in what I was doing
when I spent the night outside right?

470
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:41,389
I was going to say thanks for the hard work, you fellow.

471
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:46,588
You've worked hard.

472
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:48,793
Looks like you placed your life
on the line for this project.

473
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,906
See if this will be able to get into your good books.

474
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,660
Ji Sun.

475
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:56,418
Why? You feel a little pressured?

476
00:35:58,103 --> 00:36:00,147
I will not be pressured.

477
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:01,376
This is good too.

478
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:05,107
Even the notes that you wrote on those documents.
I will forget everything that is not work related.

479
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:09,908
Always from now on. Even if you feel disappointed,
it can't be helped.

480
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:14,258
If I was going to feel disappointed because of this,
I wouldn't have started.

481
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:45,396
You are in the wrong too, stupid guy.
Why give people the spark of hope?

482
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,405
<i>The music of chance?</i>

483
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:56,164
Where are you?

484
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,219
In the car, why?

485
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,674
Right, noona, why are you in the car now?

486
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,661
Then do you expect me to cry out loud in the company?

487
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:03,285
So shameful.

488
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:04,907
<i>That's right.</i>

489
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,635
What is right?

490
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:09,252
Miss Park, thank you.

491
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:12,062
You keep scolding Department Chief in the car right?

492
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:13,980
You can hear it?

493
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:17,199
Not getting disturbed by others, you can turn the music up,
have your own personal space.

494
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,478
Take a guess.

495
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,000
Are you still fooling around?

496
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:25,127
Noona, when your family is nagging at you
to marry someone, what do you do?

497
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:27,127
Drive the car around for a spin.

498
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,500
Oh, hold on.

499
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,661
I think I have a good idea.

500
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:34,157
Noona. Paul Auster.

501
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,574
The music of chance, have you read it before?

502
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,730
Why do modern people hide in the
car with ever chance they get?

503
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,079
Right!

504
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,687
Right!

505
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:46,818
In addition, after they saved up enough money,
what is the thing they want to buy the most?

506
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:49,122
The only place on earth that belongs only to me.

507
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:51,492
This unlimited freedom.

508
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:53,492
Noona, nice!

509
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:57,546
Lee Jun Mo, you are so dead.

510
00:37:57,596 --> 00:38:03,499
This time, it is my chance to win.
You go ahead and cry eating YubuChobap.

511
00:38:08,902 --> 00:38:10,277
Tada!

512
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:12,043
Looks delicious.

513
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:15,400
Is it good?

514
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:17,521
Of course, it is the best.

515
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,781
Can you not use that sort of words?

516
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:21,410
But why is it so much?

517
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,788
Hyung Tae was suppose to come take it too,
but he says that he won't becoming back today.

518
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:25,931
Noona, you eat too.

519
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,926
No need, I ate while I was making it, I'm so full now.

520
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,334
Jung Joo?

521
00:38:31,987 --> 00:38:36,090
Can you do an interview with our writer?
It wont' take up a lot of your time.

522
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:38,090
Our writer is writing a novel.

523
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:40,092
The main character in the novel is exactly the same as you.

524
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,820
- Really?
- Yeah!

525
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,853
Noona, this is fate.

526
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:50,620
In conclusion, I have confidence too.

527
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:53,657
Working in the publishing firm for so long,
this is the first time I'm so happy.

528
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:55,657
This time I will succeed.

529
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:57,981
Jung Joo.

530
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,407
Give me some energy.

531
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:12,850
Today, you threw the balls really well.

532
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:13,907
I'm so proud of you.

533
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,845
Nowadays, my condition is really good.

534
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:19,658
With addition of personal training,
I'm building the shoulder muscles.

535
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:22,552
I can feel that my body is not the same as last time.

536
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:24,812
The feeling is great.

537
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:28,421
If this goes on, I'll be able to become
a professional player, I've found the feeling.

538
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:31,428
This is great.

539
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:33,887
I feel so moved too.

540
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:36,572
But did noona really make this?

541
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,002
Yeah. Delicious, right?

542
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:40,082
- You didn't buy it?
- No.

543
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:21,918
<i>A performance that is done for your loved one.
The performance.</i>

544
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:24,814
<i>Right, right, performance.
Look at this pigeon performance,</i>

545
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:28,496
<i>I can release pigeons very well.*
(*It means to stand someone up)</i>

546
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,691
Ahjumma,

547
00:41:13,715 --> 00:41:15,691
Can I watch the TV?

548
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,855
Still not done?

549
00:41:54,758 --> 00:41:58,576
Because of that writer Lee Kyung Ha, I'm dead tired.

550
00:41:58,844 --> 00:42:02,347
Looks like she only started work
when it is so near to the deadline.

551
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,274
Need me to help you?

552
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,274
Really?

553
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,899
That's great.

554
00:42:10,205 --> 00:42:12,278
Then let's have dinner before continuing.

555
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:14,488
OK!

556
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:16,488
What shall we order?

557
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:19,835
It seems like you don't want to eat dinner by yourself.

558
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:22,028
People who live together are a little slow.

559
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:26,350
Writer Lee, one week before the deadline,
try to get to her good books.

560
00:42:26,368 --> 00:42:29,143
Suddenly eating alone, the feeling is weird right?

561
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:31,143
Is it extremely empty?

562
00:42:31,172 --> 00:42:33,143
I want omurice. You?

563
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,534
Hyung Tae came home before?

564
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:08,534
Hyung Tae came home already?

565
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:19,708
Hyung Tae!

566
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,599
What is this?

567
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,216
<i>Don't forget to wash the clothes.</i>

568
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:42,285
I made a trip back.

569
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:44,293
Much better if you made a call before you came back.

570
00:43:44,312 --> 00:43:46,405
<i>Why are you whining?</i>

571
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:50,829
I miss you a lot.

572
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:53,121
I'm very busy, hanging up.

573
00:43:55,766 --> 00:44:00,876
Who does he think he is? Why did he wash
the clothes before disappearing?

574
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:06,581
<i>Jun Mo</i>

575
00:44:09,403 --> 00:44:11,841
Don't you have a date tonight?

576
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:13,200
Yes.

577
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,197
Squeezed out time for you to go home, why are
you still coming back eating a biscuit?

578
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:21,581
Was that a joke just now?
Ha, I can't concentrate!

579
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:23,968
Let's go eat first before we continue.

580
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:25,968
Really going crazy.

581
00:44:25,978 --> 00:44:28,491
I say, quickly end the meeting and go home.

582
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:32,119
I still have to stay up in the night to get
a good write up on the proposal.

583
00:44:33,732 --> 00:44:36,450
I'm at home.

584
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:38,450
<i>I'm now in front of your house.</i>

585
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:39,960
<i>Can you come out awhile?</i>

586
00:44:40,002 --> 00:44:41,493
What?

587
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:45,570
Where are you?

588
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,257
<i>Why is your room light is still lit?</i>

589
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:54,847
I'm not feeling that well.

590
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:57,974
I wish to have an early rest so I'm lying down now.

591
00:44:58,249 --> 00:44:59,974
<i>Are you sick?</i>

592
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:03,589
A bit of cold.

593
00:45:04,444 --> 00:45:06,819
What's up?

594
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:09,405
Doing part-time post?

595
00:45:12,882 --> 00:45:15,603
Ubiquitous, a pixel era, a women generation.

596
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:18,283
We need to face it with a better attitude.

597
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:21,746
The females' buying power will increase steeply.

598
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:24,175
All around the world it will rise.

599
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,297
We need to use a better attitude to face it.

600
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:40,369
No need ideas.

601
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:42,219
Go to hell.

602
00:45:44,803 --> 00:45:46,729
Too cruel.

603
00:46:29,725 --> 00:46:32,160
The office is not bad.

604
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:42,875
So this is where that girl sits.

605
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:27,574
Did you sleep well?

606
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,275
The suit, did you bring it?

607
00:47:31,303 --> 00:47:34,315
Didn't you say you will come home and get it?
Why did you leave without taking it?

608
00:47:34,804 --> 00:47:37,052
Long time no see.

609
00:47:40,987 --> 00:47:42,581
From now on...

610
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:44,493
You look too unconfident of yourself.

611
00:47:44,523 --> 00:47:46,609
Chest out! Head up!

612
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:49,134
Say with uttermost confidence that your car too perfect.

613
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,738
You have to give a big boost.

614
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:54,600
Right.

615
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,055
Give it a try.

616
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:06,706
This new model of cars, you can say it is
the women's most sought after romantic item.

617
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:10,174
<i>So our clients are women.</i>

618
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:13,936
Ubiquitous, a pixel era.

619
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:18,852
The females' buying power will increase steeply.

620
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,514
The dream to get a car...

621
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,478
It is will only belong to my romantic.

622
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:43,155
It combines practicality...

623
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:45,088
I did take a long at Hyung Tae, but he is very simple.

624
00:48:45,118 --> 00:48:47,211
I did help Hyung Tae with his work before,
but that was something simple.

625
00:48:47,263 --> 00:48:49,616
Using advertisements to advertise,
it is roughly the same.

626
00:48:49,644 --> 00:48:52,609
All the materials I have already brought here,
it will not be too difficult.

627
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:54,786
Are the people directed to members?

628
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:56,786
It is directed to the general public.

629
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,446
Then it should be easily understood.

630
00:48:59,493 --> 00:49:01,346
Should be.

631
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,789
Aren't you busy?

632
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,433
Hyung Tae is so busy he has no time to meet up.

633
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,814
I have to eat quickly and get back to work.

634
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:14,509
You are still as familiar with Hyung Tae's schedule as ever.

635
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:21,149
What about your cold? Better?

636
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:22,818
Cold?

637
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,733
Much better.

638
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:40,031
<i>Hope that your first presentation will be a success.</i>

639
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,619
<i>It's not that expensive. Got it?</i>

640
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:01,623
When I pass by DonAmDong, I find myself
walking into the alley sometimes.

641
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:04,444
I will think about the past.

642
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:08,328
Last time, at your doorstep,
we often had heart to heart talks.

643
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:14,375
What is Nan Hee doing now, I'm very curious.

644
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:20,808
But your room light is often off.

645
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:24,102
<i>Love is like this.</i>

646
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,945
I sleep early.

647
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,801
Eat up.

648
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:43,249
<i>It has all ended, even if I can't
remember when it happened.</i>

649
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:56,712
<i>The once glamorous banquet,
the scar is still in the heart.</i>

650
00:50:56,768 --> 00:51:01,205
<i>It keeps changing shape, never vanishing.</i>

651
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:16,146
<i>As the time flows on, all that is left</i>

652
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:22,952
Oh, why is the mirror here?

653
00:51:23,126 --> 00:51:26,145
Sunbae, did someone sit here?

654
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,348
What?

655
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,880
Nothing.

656
00:51:56,688 --> 00:52:00,175
<i>The he who used to look at me.</i>

657
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:06,036
<i>My heart which has been hopping about in me,
between hope and setbacks.</i>

658
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:12,304
Hong Nan Hee, not getting up?

659
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:17,032
Have to wake her again.

660
00:52:25,635 --> 00:52:28,891
<i>Those are the memories of that time.</i>

661
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,085
Department Chief, I'm ready.

662
00:52:52,113 --> 00:52:53,768
All prepared?

663
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:54,897
Yes.

664
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,897
Are you confident?

665
00:52:58,364 --> 00:53:00,273
Yes, let's go.

666
00:53:18,008 --> 00:53:19,637
Did you do well?

667
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:21,911
I can't remember anything.

668
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:24,779
I don't even know what I said.

669
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:27,781
Welcome home.

670
00:53:29,034 --> 00:53:30,880
Thank you.

671
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:38,648
Yes.

672
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,104
<i>This beating heart of mine,
is a trace left by my one sided love.</i>

673
00:54:07,614 --> 00:54:10,287
Looks like I'm really capable.

674
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:12,941
The first time I did a presentation and already...

675
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,290
Yes.

676
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,640
What are you going to do?

677
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,016
What do you mean?

678
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:48,887
It's not like that.  I should treat you to a
consolation beer, but my pay has not arrived.

679
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:52,202
Talk about that incident.

680
00:54:52,233 --> 00:54:53,650
What?

681
00:54:53,697 --> 00:54:55,261
What is Nan Hee's boyfriend like?

682
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:57,631
You sound curious.

683
00:54:57,668 --> 00:55:01,719
After I told you that thing,
everything else becomes insignificant.

684
00:55:02,554 --> 00:55:04,256
Drink up.

685
00:55:09,584 --> 00:55:10,912
I'm back.

686
00:55:10,938 --> 00:55:12,912
Good.

687
00:55:13,828 --> 00:55:15,372
You are ready to leave.

688
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:16,214
Yes.

689
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,249
From Monday, the new staff have to undergo training.

690
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:24,264
When you return, do you have
any idea where you will be posted?

691
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:27,605
Maybe this is the last time, can't bear to let you go.

692
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:29,159
Me too.

693
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:31,139
Anyway, I will let you return.

694
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,752
Isn't this team full already?

695
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,277
Kick him out, that will do.

696
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:35,848
You go to other department.

697
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,350
Really...

698
00:55:37,395 --> 00:55:40,743
Right, aren't we having a simple farewell party thing?

699
00:55:40,773 --> 00:55:42,182
Right, Department Chief?

700
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:43,049
Should we?

701
00:55:43,068 --> 00:55:44,831
Hyung Tae is off work already?

702
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:47,382
Looks like he went home directly.

703
00:55:47,486 --> 00:55:50,009
Aren't you two close?
Call him back again.

704
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:54,292
Ah, no need, we said our greetings just now.

705
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:59,051
That rascal, the presentation was successful,
what is the rush, vanished off by himself.

706
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,022
Hold on.

707
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:08,615
I wish to eat the best.

708
00:56:08,968 --> 00:56:11,373
Big prawns? Salt baked?

709
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,971
Or should I bake fish in the oven for you?

710
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:36,640
That one is on sale right now.
Do you want me to wrap it up as well?

711
00:56:37,738 --> 00:56:39,826
Give me two.

712
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,447
Ah, scared me!

713
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:02,447
I heard you're having a party.

714
00:57:04,823 --> 00:57:08,194
Big prawn, I'm a connoisseur.

715
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:12,445
Mayonnaise, ketchup, sesame oil, black pepper...

716
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:16,545
You know how to eat those?

717
00:57:16,788 --> 00:57:18,807
You bought red wine too?

718
00:57:18,854 --> 00:57:21,323
It is a well-planned party.

719
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,755
Hey!

720
00:57:22,788 --> 00:57:24,292
Looks like you grew taller?

721
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:25,736
Quite difficult too, grew 2 cm.

722
00:57:25,752 --> 00:57:29,653
You are still not fully developed yet, how can you date?

723
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:32,756
Just change it to playing basketball.

724
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,756
Go on up.

725
00:57:39,765 --> 00:57:41,686
This is better?

726
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:44,585
I don't quite know unni, you pick.

727
00:57:44,648 --> 00:57:47,023
Really, then this it is.

728
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:52,122
Let me choose the salad.

729
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,105
Okay.

730
00:57:53,143 --> 00:57:55,277
Then, I will go get a bit of bread.

731
00:57:55,313 --> 00:57:57,925
Bread? What is it for?

732
00:57:57,953 --> 00:58:01,188
Hyung Tae likes to put tomatoes
on top of the bread to eat.

733
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:03,506
Then I shall pick a few tomatoes.

734
00:58:03,532 --> 00:58:05,506
Would you?

735
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,157
He was in quite a lot of pain once.

736
00:58:23,342 --> 00:58:27,029
Heard that all men are like that in their first relationship.

737
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:31,402
It has already been three years and
yet he is still afraid to fall in love.

738
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:35,023
Could there be any special reason?

739
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:41,864
Is he still waiting?

740
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:45,807
You look like you like Hyung Tae.

741
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:48,375
Maybe it is because it is one sided.

742
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:52,134
The more you know you can't have it,
the more you want it.

743
00:59:09,704 --> 00:59:12,088
Hyung, you really don't know how to play.

744
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:15,908
I just finished a workout, my hands don't have
any energy left, that's why I'm like this.

745
00:59:16,134 --> 00:59:18,939
I just threw three hundred balls.

746
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:24,487
Can you really get in to the American team?
Could it be only a dream?

747
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:26,878
Some say that.

748
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:29,420
A good pitcher is only seen once every ten years.

749
00:59:29,585 --> 00:59:32,592
A player like you, ten minutes and there will be one.

750
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:34,550
I will be going for the test next month.

751
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:35,429
America?

752
00:59:35,453 --> 00:59:37,505
Help me keep the secret from noona in the mean time.

753
00:59:37,524 --> 00:59:38,335
Why?

754
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:40,335
I don't know how it will turn out.

755
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,509
You can also think like that.

756
00:59:44,535 --> 00:59:47,860
I only want baseball and noona,
what is so difficult?

757
00:59:50,728 --> 00:59:52,884
Why do you keep taking me as an idiot?

758
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,690
When I was young, lots said I was
a generous, comments like that.

759
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:04,115
If you are a genius, the flies will not aim for rotten eggs.

760
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,737
If you came here to seduce him,
you have to go all the way.

761
01:00:44,855 --> 01:00:46,670
Ah, I don't mean that.

762
01:00:46,717 --> 01:00:51,683
Didn't you say that you were envious of me because I
can send him a text message to ask him if he has eaten?

763
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:54,628
You wish to cook for him too right?

764
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:56,628
Unni.

765
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:59,763
Thank you.

766
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:10,792
But, how do I do this?

767
01:01:10,905 --> 01:01:15,034
Soak the prawns in the salt water,
after that just give it a quick bake..

768
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:17,686
The rest, just leave it to Hyung Tae,
he is very good at that.

769
01:01:17,728 --> 01:01:21,144
The rest is written on the fridge.
It is very simple.

770
01:01:21,753 --> 01:01:24,248
I don't know if I can do it.

771
01:01:24,299 --> 01:01:25,994
That's alright.

772
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,687
Hyung Tae, he, compared to women who can cook,
he prefers pretty girls.

773
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,409
Let's give our Jung Joo a call.

774
01:01:49,237 --> 01:01:50,733
Noona!

775
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:52,799
Jung Joo!

776
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:54,925
Nan Hee!

Tell me. Will you be able to marry her?

783
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,070
Why are you talking about marriage for?
He's still a student.

784
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:18,215
He is my boyfriend.

785
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:20,965
You are eight years older than him, right?

786
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:26,210
<i>That man... I'll definitely make him mine.</i>

787
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:32,127
She works at a publishing company. Jang Comics.

788
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:32,924
What?

789
01:02:33,174 --> 01:02:34,140
Do you know?

790
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:36,710
You need to put some make-up on yourself.
DongAhn make-up set.

791
01:02:37,649 --> 01:02:38,478
It's new.

792
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:40,368
You just stay here.

793
01:02:40,435 --> 01:02:42,054
You think he's going somewhere to have fun?

794
01:02:42,169 --> 01:02:43,445
Could you please don't go?

795
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:45,431
Oppa!
