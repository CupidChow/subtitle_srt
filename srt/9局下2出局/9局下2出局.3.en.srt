2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,833
Just come back up.

3
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:09,408
No need!

4
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:10,809
Still acting tough, are you?

5
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:12,549
See how swollen your eyes are.

6
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:15,608
Is that guy really worth crying for?
It's not like someone died.

7
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:16,701
What about you?

8
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:19,778
When you fell out of love, you acted
like you were about to die too.

9
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:23,380
What are you doing?

10
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:24,666
You have nowhere else to go, do you?

11
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,291
And what has that got to do with you?

12
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:27,535
Just come back up with me.

13
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:29,535
I don't want to.

14
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:31,379
Why are you so strong?

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,677
Let go!

16
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:35,011
Didn't you say you can't live with me anymore?

17
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,965
Yes, I can't live with you anymore.

18
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:38,585
Then why are you doing this?

19
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:43,130
You really don't remember what I said yesterday?

20
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:54,041
Let's just stay together.

21
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:59,665
When I was carrying you home last night,
I said let's stay together.

22
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:01,665
Can't you remember?

23
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:07,814
Staying with me is so difficult for you?

24
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,785
For me, if you weren't around, I think I'd feel bored.

25
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,043
Let me repay the debt I owe you.

26
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:24,554
When I was having a real hard time,

27
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,535
When my parents were at a loss about what to do with me,

28
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:30,709
When I almost wanted to die,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,160
Weren't you with me by my side?

30
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,960
I want to do that for you too.

31
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:32,425
Why are you so kind all of a sudden?

32
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,480
Watching your back as you slowly went out of sight,

33
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,023
I thought to myself, I shouldn't treat you like this.

34
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,141
Is this how a wife who walked out of
the family feels when she returns?

35
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,141
It's so touching.

36
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:51,309
Is that the only bag? I'll put it in the room for you.

37
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:57,857
Hey! Why is this so light?

38
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,751
Oh! I didn't pack my things in there.

39
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:01,499
What?

40
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:04,188
Since I knew that you wouldn't let me leave...

41
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:07,931
Packing it in then taking it out, why go through all that trouble?

42
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:10,635
So I just packed some stuff that will rattle,

43
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,174
See how scared that made you!

44
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:15,695
I should try this again some time.

45
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,992
I get treated totally differently.

46
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,935
How can a person behave like this?

47
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,376
Kim Jung Joo?

48
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,183
That kid who made the speed of 140km/h?

49
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,206
Yes.

50
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:17,319
But when he was playing in youth competitions,
he didn't win any prizes, right?

51
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:20,387
At that time, his ankle was injured,
it seems he over-exercised.

52
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,786
He was very unlucky.

53
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,884
How good he is, depends on luck too.

54
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:24,996
Just take a look at him, alright?

55
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,423
I'm sure you'll be happy with him. I'll give you my guarantee.

56
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:36,779
Hey! Kim Jung Joo!

57
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:38,881
Don't throw it crooked. Just throw it straight.

58
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,360
Yes.

59
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,981
My wife throws better than that.

60
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:46,870
Throw it like you should, punk!

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,889
Hey! Did you eat something wrong?

62
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,294
What you're throwing now... you call that baseball?

63
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:04,163
I recommended you but this is embarrassing.

64
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:05,338
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,875
Don't you know how rare is it for you to have a chance like this?

66
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,761
A chance for you to stand in the world stage bearing
the honor of your country, you punk!?

67
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,082
Jung Joo, are you anxious?

68
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:15,979
There's no need to be.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,979
Didn't you show me the last time?

70
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,513
Just do it like that.

71
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:22,235
A throw with strength and inflexion.

72
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:26,460
Be confident.

73
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:31,595
Hey! Are you listening to me?

74
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,468
I can't hear anything.

75
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:38,446
I can't think of anything.

76
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,356
I can't see anything.

77
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:45,140
How did I become like this?

78
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:08,700
3rd Inning: Baseball is an art of time.

79
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:12,130
The winning ball.

80
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:49,280
Hey! Open up!

81
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,856
Hey!

82
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,384
Who is it so late?

83
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:56,333
Who are you?

84
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:59,465
I should be asking who are you, young lady?

85
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:01,844
When did she go out?

86
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:06,876
Since you drank at night, You should just stay at home.

87
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:09,483
Why are you out here creating a din?

88
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:12,286
Why wouldn't you believe me? Why?

89
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:18,156
Of course I understand how you feel,

90
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:19,887
Nan Hee!

91
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:23,025
Sorry for the disturbance. Sorry!

92
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,782
Nan Hee! Are you hurt? Let me see.

93
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,282
Jung Joo and I...

94
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,826
Just stay put for a while. You're bleeding.

95
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,195
Hyung Tae!

96
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,195
Your skin's all scratched.

97
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,223
Isn't it painful?

98
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,050
Painful.

99
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:11,291
Sunbae, we're leaving first.

100
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:14,117
Enjoy your meal.

101
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,887
Yes.

102
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,840
Oh! You're giving us a treat?

103
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,153
Thank you.

104
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,519
This is new! Why would you be paying?

105
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:31,783
She's pretty, isn't she?

106
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:37,127
That girl wearing the white top,
the competition for her is real strong.

107
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,445
I like the pink one better. Is she from the design team?

108
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:41,869
Didn't you say you won't be dating?

109
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,468
Aren't they interns?

110
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:44,947
Will they stay on in the company for sure?

111
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:46,947
You scheming fella.

112
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:49,898
But why do you insist on not dating?

113
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,428
I've ordered food for you.

114
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,060
Thanks!

115
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:58,471
Ji Sun, this guy is extremely popular in the company.

116
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,065
But it's so strange,

117
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,451
He never dates those around him.

118
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,451
Do you know why?

119
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:09,036
Maybe he's done too many wrongs to women in the past.

120
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:11,432
For example?

121
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,432
It's plain to tell he's got lots of secrets.

122
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:15,166
You're just the same as me.

123
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:19,170
The two of you... do you have some secret between you?

124
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:25,833
The interns seem to be lunching together
but why are you here alone?

125
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:30,481
Nakasan*?
(*a person who got the job through connections)

126
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,753
Yes. That's why they don't like her very much.

127
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,152
There are so many nakasans in an advertising company.

128
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,411
The few of them always get ostracized, don't they?

129
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:41,679
I heard she's the daughter of the biggest
wine wholesaler here.

130
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:43,679
Exactly like the Go Hyun Jung of our era.

131
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,434
Oh! You guys are here!

132
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,365
Yes.

133
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,231
Who will date me tonight?

134
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,376
What?

135
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:52,376
The time is right after work.

136
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,709
Oh! I'm very busy.

137
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,709
Very!

138
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:07,113
Me?

139
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:08,300
Yes.

140
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:16,861
Hello!

141
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:19,553
This is the time slot for Chief Kang, right?

142
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:20,507
Yes.

143
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:21,664
Do you know me?

144
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:22,626
Planning Team 2.

145
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,707
We know you,

146
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:25,398
Section Head Byun Hyung Tae.

147
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,398
You treated us to lunch earlier.

148
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,398
OK.

149
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,228
I've come in place of Chief Kang.

150
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:41,705
So who was it who had a generous portion of a huge steak just now?

151
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,195
Own up quick!

152
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:49,710
So today, let's talk about the advertising business.

153
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:53,136
You're just going back now?

154
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,136
Yes.

155
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,136
You didn't join in the celebration?

156
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,661
What celebration?

157
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,957
You really don't know about it or are you pretending?

158
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:04,842
Didn't they say in the meeting just now
that they're going for drinks after?

159
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,842
I really didn't know.

160
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:12,800
With a foreign car and branded clothes,
your colleagues feel threatened by you, agree?

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,402
Regardless, I'd still be ostracized,
so I might as well live comfortably.

162
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:17,745
You're rather carefree.

163
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:21,979
Having been ostracized for so long,
it has become a habit already.

164
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:23,672
Goodbye!

165
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:25,233
I'm off!

166
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:50,959
What's this?

167
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:58,386
Oh! I didn't press 7.

168
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:08,329
How long have you been standing like this?

169
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:09,892
What?

170
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,850
I've been back for a while.

171
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,723
What time is it now?

172
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,841
Do you know what time it is?

173
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,050
You wore your clothes inside out.

174
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,733
You didn't shower, did you?

175
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:36,043
Aren't you bucking yourself up?

176
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:37,572
Oh! What a shock!

177
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,494
Why are you yelling?

178
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:45,173
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

179
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,439
Put me down.

180
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,439
Hey!

181
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,190
Hey! Let go! Let me go!

182
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:54,779
Come here!

183
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:56,968
What are you doing?

184
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,660
Ah! Hot!

185
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,021
You want me to give you a shampoo?

186
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,657
What are you doing to me now?

187
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:05,317
Not eating, not sleeping,

188
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,901
You're just drinking everyday. It's not the end of the world,

189
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:12,213
Yet you're living your life in such a mess.
What if something happens to you?

190
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:16,654
Oh! My script!

191
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,306
Is it very important?

192
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,695
Do you want to die in my hands? You!

193
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:35,265
I edited a whole lot of it already,
but now I'll have to do it all over again.

194
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:37,894
How would I know?

195
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,917
If it was the finalized script,
I'd really be in hot soup.

196
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:43,398
Luckily, it isn't, right?

197
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,820
Next one.

198
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:56,752
Has this author ever been to school?

199
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,091
How could he have gotten so many words wrong?

200
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,957
Stop picking on it. Just do it.

201
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:07,198
What?

202
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:10,757
What kind of comic is this?
Why is it so unhealthy?

203
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,192
That's the kind of comic it is.

204
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,862
Fine. Just go now.

205
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,293
I'll do it myself.

206
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:37,217
Why? I'll do it.

207
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,751
Oh it's so hot.

208
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:51,427
Hey! What are you doing?

209
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,297
Come over.

210
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,658
What?

211
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,052
- Come over.
- Stop it.

212
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:59,818
Come over.

213
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:04,945
Don't come over.

214
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,170
Come and you'll be dead!

215
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,539
Are you more alert now?

216
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,205
I'm completely alert, you rascal!

217
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:20,623
Want some coffee?

218
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:21,984
Give me a cold one.

219
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:23,984
Yes, a hot one.

220
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:45,909
Why does she suddenly feel like a woman to me now?

221
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,766
[Delete?]

222
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:25,870
Not sleeping yet?

223
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:27,711
You sleep first.

224
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:29,711
I'm going to write some more.

225
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:33,297
Oh! So now you're back to normal.

226
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,989
I have something to think about.

227
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,119
Do you want me to borrow more material for you?

228
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:39,516
Just tell me what you need.

229
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,436
How about I get some video tapes for you?

230
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:45,107
It should help you get some ideas, right?

231
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:52,518
What? You're looking at me strangely.

232
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,924
Could it be our quarrel and the crisis
we went through together?

233
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,050
These days you seem more and more acceptable.

234
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:02,050
It's nothing much.

235
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,126
Once you see all my good points,
you might get mesmerized.

236
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,565
Thanks.

237
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,565
For this and that.

238
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:14,312
I'll gather myself and move on.

239
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,992
Let me have that.

240
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,492
[Delete?]

241
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,627
You have only 5 seconds to think about it.

242
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:31,068
If you can't decide after 5 seconds, I'll place the call.

243
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:37,275
5... 4... 3... 2... 1.

244
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:39,156
Delete it.

245
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:52,555
Try pressing '1'.

246
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,533
[Hyung Tae]

247
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:06,321
If number 1 is left vacant, you'd feel very empty.

248
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:08,693
If you're careless and lose your way,

249
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:13,108
Or when you're drunk and can't find your way home,
just press '1'. I'll mobilize myself for you.

250
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,275
Is this how you get the girls every time?

251
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:18,880
Am I mad?

252
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:22,151
Why would I give the precious number '1'
to just some lady acquaintance?

253
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,151
This line from you is not bad too.

254
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:26,151
I'm going to bed now.

255
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:32,369
But, why aren't you dating women recently?

256
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,369
Are you sick of them already?

257
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:35,089
No.

258
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:37,713
You've been with me for almost a month now,

259
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:40,186
But I've not seen you date.

260
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:41,369
Me?

261
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,892
Isn't it true?

262
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:45,697
You're always having dinner at home.

263
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:48,365
No!

264
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:11,188
Thinking about it more, there is
a woman on my mind.

265
00:21:11,524 --> 00:21:13,007
Me?

266
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,938
Is my shampoo really that fragrant?

267
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:20,014
Even when I'm out of love,
I won't turn my attention onto a friend.

268
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,217
I'm really lonely.

269
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:25,369
Keep your door lock when you sleep.

270
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:34,837
A woman on his mind?

271
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,471
What?

272
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:40,694
He'll just split with her after a few days.

273
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,734
Oh! Sorry! Sorry!

274
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,802
What? What? What?

275
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,267
Promise me something.

276
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:58,480
What?

277
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:00,796
Don't get married before me.

278
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,796
Oh! Really!

279
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:12,055
Sung Wook is getting married, huh?

280
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,486
But what's wrong with you?

281
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:19,313
I'm happy for her.
Very happy for her, sincerely.

282
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:22,306
No need to emphasize it. So pitiful.

283
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:26,766
It's true. Sending you an invitation
now is a little cruel to you.

284
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:28,339
Wrinkles.

285
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,874
Eye bags.

286
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,942
Festivals.

287
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:31,974
Family gatherings.

288
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:33,109
Soft and subtle skin.

289
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:35,564
Bouncy breasts.

290
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:38,528
To me, all such things are extremely cruel.

291
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,834
The world is going further and further away from me.

292
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:47,764
So you received it too?

293
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:51,664
Amongst our classmates, other than
the eight of us, the rest are all taken.

294
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:53,664
Everyone's taken, so what about us?

295
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:57,281
How can we just sit and wait to die?

296
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,858
"Time is passing me by, he's coming towards me"

297
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:02,761
He?

298
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,761
Aging! Aging!

299
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:08,771
Oh. Mine's already here.

300
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:11,846
I'm already all too familiar with it.

301
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,799
How can you do nothing?
You should fight against it.

302
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:16,111
Chun Hee...

303
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:20,994
I think I'm going to grow old being lonely
then eventually I'll become an elderly single.

304
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,185
When festivals come, I have nowhere to go.

305
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,301
And no one will invite me to celebrate it with them.

306
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:28,057
I'll just order a bowl of jjajangmyun and be done with it.

307
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:29,947
What happens if I become an old woman like that?

308
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,431
Stop talking nonsense.

309
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,923
I'll book a flight ticket and ask if he/she wants to go along.

310
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:36,544
A man's voice. Who is that?

311
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:39,337
Oh nothing. It's the sound of the TV.

312
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,518
What is the reason to keep it from them too?

313
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:49,522
Although we had no choice but to live together,
that's still not something normal.

314
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:52,781
Although we are just housemates, but
to others, they'll see it as co-habitating.

315
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,275
They won't bother asking questions,
they'll just say we're co-habitating.

316
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:57,048
This is due to some special situations,

317
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,823
It's not like we chose to live together.

318
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,535
Would you dare to let your parents know?

319
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:02,239
Well, that...

320
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:04,459
If they know, they'll be worried.

321
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:08,688
See, it doesn't mean if you have a good reason,
everyone will understand.

322
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:13,506
Jun Mo and Chun Hee are there already.

323
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:16,786
So it's like that, huh?

324
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:18,413
What?

325
00:24:18,563 --> 00:24:21,008
You're acting like this because of Jun Mo, right?

326
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:24,081
That's why you can't tell them we're living together?

327
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:28,915
Although your relationship has ended, you still
want to keep some space for Jun Mo, right?

328
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:31,076
Do you think I have the energy to consider that?

329
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:33,883
Anyhow, I don't like those useless secrets.

330
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:35,611
I know.

331
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:38,065
Why do you have to apply so much?
No one's going to notice you.

332
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:40,065
The mascara's made my eye bags darker.

333
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:49,743
Sorry, we're a little late.

334
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:51,286
You're here?

335
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,286
Hello.

336
00:24:53,637 --> 00:24:56,432
You're wearing too little.
There will be strong winds today.

337
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,373
No, I'm fine.

338
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:05,047
With make-up so thick, it won't matter
even if a typhoon came along.

339
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,135
Let's go.

340
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,632
Why would they have an outdoor
wedding in the rainy season?

341
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:18,960
I'm thinking that too.

342
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,960
What if it rains?

343
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,898
Don't you think they look like they're wishing for rain?

344
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,476
That can't be.

345
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:29,476
So you still don't understand them well.

346
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:31,626
How scary women are!

347
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:58,976
Weren't they somewhat depressed earlier?

348
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:02,731
It's because they're too pleased with the groom.

349
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:07,064
But telling the truth, even in
the eyes of men, he looks terrible.

350
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:09,594
That's what they like about him!

351
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:13,287
How sickening they are.

352
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,595
The weather's so good.

353
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,221
Yes. Why would it rain on such a fine day?

354
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:25,708
Still so adorable.

355
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:28,405
Who?

356
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:30,662
Chun Hee?

357
00:26:44,192 --> 00:26:45,688
We're just friends, that's all.

358
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,310
Really?

359
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,030
Then, that's fine.

360
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:54,857
So you like Nan Hee?

361
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,262
<i>I'm doing the broadcast duty today.</i>

362
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,043
<i>I'm Lee Jun Mo from Year 2 Class 1.</i>

363
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:03,356
Why is it Jun Mo?
Isn't it your duty today?

364
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:07,755
<i>To all teachers and everyone, I am very sorry.</i>

365
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:12,565
<i>I'd like to broadcast a little personal message,
I hope you will all bear with me.</i>

366
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:18,380
<i>Today, I'd like to make a love confession to her.</i>

367
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,341
<i>Nan Hee!</i>

368
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,112
<i>I like you.</i>

369
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:29,141
<i>Although I don't know when it started or how it started,</i>

370
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:34,708
<i>When I realized my feelings for you
were beyond just friendship,</i>

371
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,131
<i>I had wanted to let you know.</i>

372
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:58,938
Do you know why Nan Hee and I broke up?

373
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,448
I don't know.

374
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:03,497
I told her not to see you anymore.

375
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,835
But she said she couldn't do that.

376
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:10,856
Am I such a big eye sore?

377
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:14,834
She'd rather break up with her boyfriend
than to part with a friend like you.

378
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:19,903
To Nan Hee, you're someone
who's more than a friend to her.

379
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:42,062
Someone said he was going
to reveal about us co-habitating.

380
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:46,210
Didn't you say not everyone will understand us?

381
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,210
Hong Nan Hee.

382
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:50,152
What?

383
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:52,358
Why did you break up with Jun Mo?

384
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:58,960
He said he was sick of me,
didn't you already know this?

385
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,568
Why?

386
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:04,880
Did Jun Mo say anything?

387
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:06,666
No.

388
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:29,893
Who is it?

389
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:38,789
Why can't I open it?

390
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:55,748
Who are you?

391
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:58,858
Oh sorry!

392
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:12,010
In this building, there are quite a few lonely people like me.

393
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:15,791
I think so.

394
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,791
Goodnight.

395
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,258
Good throw.

396
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:56,460
Um... I'm really sorry about the other day.

397
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:59,536
What's with the young people these days?

398
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,811
Living in the same house,
making a din after getting drunk,

399
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:07,115
It was already so late at night.
Did you know what time that was?

400
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:09,641
I'm very sorry.

401
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:14,630
That young man came to me several times to explain
things, so I won't hold it against you this time.

402
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,508
But, it seems the two of you aren't married, right?

403
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:22,581
Yes. But ours is not that kind of relationship.

404
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:28,605
I have no reason to bother with the lifestyles
of young people these days anyway.

405
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:37,536
Why are you so late?

406
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:45,960
Oh! You're here already?

407
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:48,356
Yes, you're here too.

408
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:53,940
Ah! Why are young people behaving like that nowadays?

409
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:55,017
Why?

410
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:58,294
Something else happened to that drunken girl again?

411
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:03,105
Mom! I'm just checking if you've eaten?

412
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:05,338
<i>You seem to be calling more often lately.</i>

413
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:08,738
Cash is still more substantial than a phone call,

414
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:11,959
but since I still can't manage
to do it now, I can only regret it.

415
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:16,913
How about I find you a nice man?

416
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:19,120
Nowadays they say there's nothing
more filial than doing that.

417
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:23,550
Find one for yourself first.
Do me the favor.

418
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:33,699
I'm just done with my singing practice
near your office. Do you want to come?

419
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,602
The dumpling soup is really tasty.

420
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:38,999
Busy?

421
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:40,999
Oh alright then.

422
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:44,789
Yes I know. I'll eat a lot.

423
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:46,789
Yes. Yes.

424
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,735
Your daughter is so caring.
She doesn't forget to check on you.

425
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:54,079
Oh, kids these days are like that.

426
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,962
Whose kids aren't the same?

427
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,617
I heard she's not married yet, right?

428
00:32:57,648 --> 00:32:58,482
Does she have a boyfriend?

429
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,732
Oh, she doesn't know about that.

430
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:04,659
She's too naive. She hasn't got a boyfriend yet.

431
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:08,213
Why? Do you have someone to recommend?

432
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,090
Ahjussi, although it'll be a little more trouble,

433
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:15,702
but please tell them to place these in a better spot, alright?

434
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:16,837
There's no free lunch.

435
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:21,998
You just have to tell them these were hot
in Japan once, they'll give you a good spot.

436
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,742
Noona!

437
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,603
Ahjussi, wait a minute.

438
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:29,162
Why? What?

439
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,162
Ahjussi, get on, quick!

440
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,451
Noona!

441
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:56,072
Running so hard all for an ice cream?

442
00:33:56,505 --> 00:34:00,457
Hey! Do you know how meaningful this ad is?

443
00:34:05,218 --> 00:34:06,302
Why?

444
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,302
Oh nothing.

445
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:17,822
If you're not happy with it, I don't have to play it.

446
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:22,043
Well, there aren't many customers anyway.

447
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:25,880
Please play it. We'll listen to what we want.

448
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,021
Why is that guy so bad at running?

449
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:43,174
Yes, if you're talking about running,
Tom Cruise was great at it.

450
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:47,935
Noona!

451
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,644
<i>Noona!</i>

452
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:53,460
He can really run.

453
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,252
Noona!

454
00:34:57,192 --> 00:34:58,642
Noona!

455
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:01,753
<i>You should have gone straight,
then he won't catch up with us.</i>

456
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:04,976
But, he's running on the road,
what can I do, ahjussi?

457
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:09,208
Noona!

458
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:12,702
<i>Was it fun watching?</i>

459
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:15,114
Yes, it's very interesting.

460
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,427
I just remembered, this is yours, right?

461
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:37,252
I was just about to ask you too.

462
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:40,496
But, you just didn't get the chance, right?

463
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,652
The job's all done.

464
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,779
You can really do it on your own?

465
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,225
I can leave?

466
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,803
Yes. But, aren't you living alone?

467
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,989
I think you mentioned that before.

468
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,663
Yes, why?

469
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:03,344
Those who live alone seldom miss their
home but you're always leaving early.

470
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:07,938
I have a dog at home, I have to go home and feed it.

471
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:09,850
What?

472
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,113
Section Head Byun and a dog, where's the similarity?

473
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:16,134
What about you? You have no boyfriend?

474
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:17,221
I caught you.

475
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:18,408
What?

476
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:24,062
The code in your conversation.
The dog represents your girlfriend.

477
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,669
I'm off.

478
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,579
See you!

479
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,955
You crazy lunatic!

480
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:38,813
The pitcher runs away on the way to the game.
What will happen to the team?

481
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,452
You crazy lunatic.

482
00:36:40,503 --> 00:36:42,452
Are you dumb?

483
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:44,452
How could there be anyone like you?

484
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:47,343
What were you trying to do? You don't
want to play baseball anymore?

485
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,664
What? You're giving it all up because
you didn't get into the national team?

486
00:36:52,438 --> 00:36:54,833
Do you have brains or not?

487
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,790
<i>I don't have time to think about that.</i>

488
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,275
That's what I mean. Why did you run away?

489
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:10,228
I thought your debtors were coming after you.

490
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:13,151
He knows your office and house address too.

491
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:16,696
Whenever he wants to, he could go and see you.

492
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,280
Noona! Noona!

493
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:27,083
Open up!

494
00:37:27,097 --> 00:37:28,240
Noona!

495
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:30,793
Noona!

496
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:36,500
<i>I really thought hard about it but I still don't get it.</i>

497
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:40,179
<i>Why on earth did we break up?</i>

498
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:43,717
<i>Noona! Noona!</i>

499
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:47,138
<i>Open up this door!</i>

500
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,597
<i>Can you do without me?</i>

501
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,450
<i>Can you live?</i>

502
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:53,450
<i>I'm about to die.</i>

503
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:56,592
<i>Noona! Noona!!</i>

504
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:59,423
Noona...

505
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:01,731
I love you.

506
00:38:02,818 --> 00:38:05,364
I know, you punk.

507
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:07,090
Long time no see.

508
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,090
Hyung-nim!

509
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:12,236
Hyung-nim.

510
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:19,358
Hey!

511
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,187
Noona!

512
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,187
Take off your shoes, you!

513
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:24,822
Noona!

514
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:31,539
Do you know how much I missed
your face and your hands?

515
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:37,165
I wanted to hold you, to touch you,
I wanted to hear your voice.

516
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:40,264
I wanted so much to...

517
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,056
Noona, you didn't miss me?

518
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:46,473
You're really living fine?

519
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:58,898
You said you were very tired out so
I thought I should just bear with it.

520
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:04,247
But I really tried very hard already.

521
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:10,471
But I can't, I just can't no matter how hard I try.

522
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:14,620
Without you, I can't think.

523
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:17,420
I can't do anything.

524
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,343
I can't even pitch anymore.

525
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:24,958
Without you, without baseball, I will die.

526
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:32,573
Jung Joo! Jung Joo!

527
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:37,181
Don't cry. It's all my fault.

528
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,724
I really didn't want to come,

529
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:45,234
But when I saw you today,
I really have gone insane.

530
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:52,960
It's like my heart's all torn up and my head's all split.

531
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:58,384
It hurts too much here. Really hurts.

532
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,081
You want dinner before you go?

533
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:08,416
Hyung-nim, please save me!

534
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:10,339
Hong Nan Hee.

535
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,642
Decide quickly. Haven't you been waiting for so long?

536
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:17,166
And you, if you dare forget to use polite
terms with me in future, you're dead!

537
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:18,909
Yes.

538
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:33,768
Why did I bother to come home early?

539
00:40:34,605 --> 00:40:37,134
Here's the burger you ordered, enjoy your meal.

540
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,134
Thank you.

541
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:43,073
What is it that's taking you so long?

542
00:40:43,094 --> 00:40:44,733
Why are you back here?

543
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,733
I came to catch up on my reading.

544
00:40:47,326 --> 00:40:50,131
If I knew you were still around,
I'd buy one more of these.

545
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,090
I have my sushi right here.

546
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:54,090
Shall we exchange?

547
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:56,340
Here, let me take a look.

548
00:40:58,153 --> 00:41:02,070
If this is the level you're attaining,
there's a serious problem.

549
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,584
Is it that bad?

550
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:13,527
It's kind of bad but the way you are ostracized
by others is a more serious problem.

551
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:17,865
The rest of the interns are doing
this in teams, why are you alone?

552
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:20,684
I'll learn as I work at it.

553
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,585
Anyhow, I've no choice but to remain in this company.

554
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:25,585
You're really...

555
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:28,586
I just have to keep thinking positive.

556
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:34,701
You're not leaving yet?

557
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:36,843
You go ahead first.

558
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,843
Where have I seen this before?

559
00:41:38,898 --> 00:41:42,598
The colleague in the office suddenly changed his attire.

560
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:45,380
He becomes much more attractive.

561
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,775
I'm just saying.

562
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,775
I'm leaving first.

563
00:42:03,302 --> 00:42:06,833
Oh! Why is this book so uninteresting?

564
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,648
Hello.

565
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:13,376
Oh, you're here?

566
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:14,613
Hyung-nim!

567
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:17,143
Oh, you guys are here too?

568
00:42:17,844 --> 00:42:20,176
Come over. Why are you sitting alone?

569
00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:21,436
Forget it.

570
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:23,867
You're really sitting alone?

571
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:25,445
Yes, give me an egg please.

572
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:27,445
What's up with you guys?

573
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:29,228
We can't finish the food here, come over.

574
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:31,036
Hyung-nim, please come.

575
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:32,818
If others hear you, they'll think I'm some gangster.

576
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,972
I'll pour you a drink.

577
00:42:33,993 --> 00:42:35,159
Forget it.

578
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,607
Just speak in polite terms, that'll do.

579
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:40,816
Rascal, he's disgusting even when he speaks politely.

580
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:44,061
Hey! You punk shouldn't speak at all.

581
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:46,131
We'll go over instead.

582
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,144
Hey, hey, hey!

583
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:51,215
Hyung-nim, what are you doing now?

584
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:53,867
What's that?

585
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:58,026
Why are you writing with your finger?

586
00:43:01,447 --> 00:43:03,829
Young man, how do you read this?

587
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,131
It's U.S.A.

588
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:07,131
Rascal!

589
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:12,170
I thought you'd say "oohsa", I'm so disappointed.

590
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:15,721
Next question.

591
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:21,398
In my eyes, why is Nan Hee a girl...

592
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:23,398
Me? What about me?

593
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:25,884
Nothing. Nothing.

594
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:29,364
Listen up.

595
00:43:29,545 --> 00:43:33,347
21 people are playing scissors, paper, stone together.

596
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:35,171
One try only for each game.

597
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:41,399
One of them wins everybody else.
What is the probability of coming in tops?

598
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,043
Do you know the answer?

599
00:43:43,073 --> 00:43:45,043
Isn't it 21%?

600
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,532
You have to understand... understand it well.

601
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,109
No.

602
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:55,809
Even if you don't understand it,
how can you say it's 21%?

603
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:57,809
You ignorant...

604
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,372
Hey, police! Come and lock up this guy.

605
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:10,085
Hey! Hey, fella! Let's walk together.

606
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,531
He's gone?

607
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:12,850
Yes.

608
00:44:14,627 --> 00:44:17,265
Don't tell me you kissed?

609
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,795
Otherwise, why that radiant expression?

610
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:26,018
He said he missed your hands and your face
so much so that he's almost gone insane.

611
00:44:26,888 --> 00:44:30,027
It seems he hasn't seen the rest of you yet.

612
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:34,202
Even so, I was just about to ask you things related to that.

613
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,587
No... no... no.

614
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:37,144
You guys figure it out yourselves.

615
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:38,286
Why?

616
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:40,259
Didn't you ask me about that before?

617
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,400
If you're really curious then... what's that called?

618
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,902
Oh! Youth Sex Hotline.

619
00:44:45,932 --> 00:44:48,173
Call there with your questions.

620
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,022
Let me get the number for you.

621
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,955
Hey!

622
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:55,633
Wait!

623
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:57,633
Why?

624
00:45:04,304 --> 00:45:05,517
I know.

625
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:06,452
What?

626
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,639
A woman who's in love is very sexy.

627
00:45:08,658 --> 00:45:09,732
Right?

628
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:11,732
Ah, that must be it.

629
00:45:12,328 --> 00:45:14,893
Do I look sexy to you?

630
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:20,538
Seeing you in love, I'm rather envious.

631
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:23,691
I'm jealous.

632
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,584
It's the truth.

633
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:33,368
We only walked at the start...

634
00:45:34,071 --> 00:45:38,451
It was raining and I was feeling kind of blue.

635
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,398
It's the truth.

636
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:42,991
It's not a lie.

637
00:45:43,155 --> 00:45:47,489
I'm sorry. I'm in front of your house.

638
00:45:47,684 --> 00:45:49,346
I love you.

639
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:51,062
Love who?

640
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:01,426
Youth Sex Hotline
02-715-8600

641
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:10,282
Coach, please forgive me this once.

642
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:12,775
It will never, ever happen again.

643
00:46:12,826 --> 00:46:15,737
I can pitch now, coach!

644
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:18,822
<i>I'm going for coffee, who wants?</i>

645
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:20,822
- Me.
- Me.

646
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,745
I'll go with you.

647
00:46:31,475 --> 00:46:33,836
<i>Didn't you work with Ji Sun before?</i>

648
00:46:33,862 --> 00:46:34,924
<i>Wasn't it upsetting?</i>

649
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:35,935
<i>That's what I said.</i>

650
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:38,249
Are they talking about you now?

651
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:42,006
<i>Should we take it from the customer's
angle or from the company's angle?</i>

652
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:45,377
<i>Doing it this way and that way,
what are they thinking of?</i>

653
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:49,847
<i>Could it be she forgot what she said before?</i>

654
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,092
<i>She's a nakasan.</i>

655
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:54,276
That's right. She doesn't know anything.

656
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:01,297
Wow! Hearing the terms you use
when you talk, you all sound like experts.

657
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:04,828
Better than me. I was struggling with how to train you guys.

658
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:09,133
Ji Sun's report was vetted by me.

659
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:13,214
It's far off the mark, is it?

660
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:30,041
You stay back tonight.

661
00:47:31,534 --> 00:47:34,771
I'll give you one or two tips.

662
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:39,036
In our company, this proves to be the most effective.

663
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,895
Go touch up on your make-up.

664
00:47:58,266 --> 00:47:59,272
Yes?

665
00:47:59,298 --> 00:48:00,930
<i>Gosh!</i>

666
00:48:01,602 --> 00:48:04,141
How can the first word in a phone conversation be "Gosh"?

667
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:06,384
I pressed '1' by habit.

668
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:08,611
Hey! You'd better get that changed quickly.

669
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:11,470
If that kid finds out, he's going to blow his top again.

670
00:48:11,493 --> 00:48:13,231
Will you be back early today?

671
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:14,632
Why?

672
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:17,049
I'd like to visit my mom.

673
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:18,274
Fine.

674
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:20,274
Then I'll eat before I go home.

675
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,406
Yes. See you later.

676
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,678
But, I won't change my number '1'.

677
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,826
<i>Do you know how moved I was at that time?</i>

678
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:32,265
Yeah right.

679
00:48:32,286 --> 00:48:34,677
There'll come a day when I can return your kindness.

680
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:37,898
If you want to return it, then change it to cash for me.

681
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:42,601
Anyway from now on, even if I press '1' by mistake,
just be magnanimous with me, alright?

682
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:44,740
Yes.

683
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:54,467
You seem thinner recently.

684
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:57,474
Now that I've moved out, you're missing me?

685
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:00,800
If you grow any thinner, you won't get married out.

686
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,438
I'm totally overwhelmed.

687
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,147
You should just eat more.

688
00:49:06,187 --> 00:49:08,002
Yun Hee, aren't you sensitive about the smell of food?

689
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:09,596
Yes, not much morning sickness.

690
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,500
I've ordered blankets. They should deliver
it directly to your place, right?

691
00:49:12,528 --> 00:49:13,731
Summer blanket?

692
00:49:13,753 --> 00:49:15,420
Why the need for that?

693
00:49:15,448 --> 00:49:17,101
From the market, we can get real cheap ones.

694
00:49:17,131 --> 00:49:20,921
When I got Yun Hee's done, I got one for you too.
How would you know what to choose?

695
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:23,472
Oh yes. I forgot to take out the new kimchi I made.

696
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:27,641
Your blanket is specially ordered.

697
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:30,817
She seems to be worried that you're living alone.

698
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:38,456
Mom, I seem to love you more and more recently.

699
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:41,836
What? You're talking nonsense again?

700
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:44,110
Oh, forget it.

701
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,358
This soup is good. I'll bring some back later.

702
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:48,159
Hyung Tae will be so ecstatic to see this sea urchin soup.

703
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,759
You're going to Hyung Tae's house now?

704
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:54,981
No, I'm sending it over tomorrow.

705
00:49:58,755 --> 00:49:59,625
Here.

706
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:01,019
Why is there so much?

707
00:50:01,038 --> 00:50:03,989
The weather is getting hotter.
Be careful with food hygiene.

708
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:05,166
Yes.

709
00:50:05,185 --> 00:50:08,070
Take note of your behavior.
Be responsible and live well!

710
00:50:08,126 --> 00:50:11,658
A woman living alone is easy prey
for those talking behind your back.

711
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,289
You're not up to any hanky-panky, are you?

712
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,532
What hanky-panky?

713
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:18,424
In my singing class, I heard a woman saying,

714
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,843
that in her building, a pair of unmarried
guy and girl are living together.

715
00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:25,605
I really don't know what kids are thinking these days.

716
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:29,778
When a guy and girl live together,
does it always have to mean trouble?

717
00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:32,244
And I think there's nothing bad about living together,

718
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:33,452
If they are doing it because they like each other...

719
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:36,438
Rascal! Are you trying it out too?

720
00:50:36,474 --> 00:50:38,387
Oh! I can't even get near to trying it out.

721
00:50:38,423 --> 00:50:40,788
How can you... what have I been teaching you?

722
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:43,602
No, I didn't say it's good.

723
00:50:43,635 --> 00:50:45,927
What I mean is... there is only a possibility.

724
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:49,908
You, if you entertain that idea, you'd carry it out.

725
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:52,250
I know, mom, it hurts!

726
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:53,869
They are so terrible.

727
00:50:53,898 --> 00:50:56,498
Horrible! Incorrigible!

728
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:01,184
Sea urchin soup?

729
00:51:02,663 --> 00:51:04,139
I knew you'd love it.

730
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,267
I brought a lot for you.
Just keep it and eat it slowly.

731
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:07,534
Great. Keep it safely for me.

732
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:10,247
Tomorrow, Jung Joo has a game.
Are you coming?

733
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,681
He wants me to come?

734
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:14,479
<i>It's fun to watch games at the stadium
these days. The weather is nice too.</i>

735
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,174
Fine, I'll go.

736
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:17,481
<i>Will you be late?</i>

737
00:51:17,521 --> 00:51:19,744
It's already ten o'clock, you're still in the office?

738
00:51:19,882 --> 00:51:21,899
I think I'll be late.

739
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:24,824
<i>What's wrong with this?
Doesn't seem anything's wrong?</i>

740
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,260
That woman!

741
00:51:27,347 --> 00:51:30,615
Are you working overtime with that
woman who's on your mind?

742
00:51:30,991 --> 00:51:31,950
Right?

743
00:51:39,076 --> 00:51:41,484
Kim Jung Joo, what's up with you?

744
00:51:41,505 --> 00:51:43,934
Coach, I'll pitch well today.

745
00:51:43,948 --> 00:51:45,612
Look forward to it.

746
00:51:46,844 --> 00:51:48,742
This punk!

747
00:52:14,383 --> 00:52:16,889
Why isn't he answering his calls?

748
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:27,415
Why isn't he answering his calls?

749
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:35,827
Hey! Where are you?

750
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:39,612
Why aren't you answering your calls?
Do you know how worried I am?

751
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:41,612
Right behind you.

752
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:44,340
Why were you yelling?

753
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,433
You didn't answer your phone and you didn't come home.

754
00:52:46,445 --> 00:52:48,100
Of course I'd be worried.

755
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,336
I didn't know it was off.

756
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:51,431
What on earth were you doing that
you didn't even realize it was off?

757
00:52:51,452 --> 00:52:53,431
Why are you shouting?

758
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,431
It's so embarrassing.

759
00:52:57,316 --> 00:53:00,314
Sit down first. Wave to Jung Joo. Hurry!

760
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:08,136
The restroom is so far away.
It took a long time to find you.

761
00:53:08,176 --> 00:53:10,346
Who are you?

762
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:35,820
A guy who pitches so well...

763
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:39,384
Now a sinker... and finish them off.

764
00:53:47,152 --> 00:53:50,813
Is he in a particularly good condition
or is he usually like this too?

765
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:53,677
That kind of sinker, it's as if he can
throw it anytime he wants to.

766
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,943
He's usually like this at practice.

767
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:57,568
Oh! What a waste! Punk.

768
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:02,531
When they were recruiting for the national team,
why didn't he make it?

769
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,816
- Anyone knew?
- You're talking about Jung Joo?

770
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:06,516
It was because he was dumped by
a woman so his mood was bad.

771
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:07,445
What?

772
00:54:07,463 --> 00:54:10,673
When he was dumped, he really suffered.

773
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,938
What a lunatic!

774
00:54:22,894 --> 00:54:24,311
What's the meaning of that sign?

775
00:54:24,337 --> 00:54:27,361
Ah! A secret sign between us.

776
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:29,500
Happy?

777
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:31,266
This is great.

778
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:37,226
Of course it is. It's as good as being at a concert,
and having the singer wave at me.

779
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:41,931
Looking into my eyes and singing for me,
it's totally touching.

780
00:55:00,636 --> 00:55:02,707
Who is that ahjumma?

781
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:11,476
[For my hope... Jung Joo oppa! Fighting!]

782
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:42,589
