<i>Spring 2000</i>

3
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,626
<i>Letter number 53!</i>

4
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:25,696
<i>You’re finally discharged from the army.</i>

5
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:26,761
<i>Congratulations friend!</i>

6
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:28,674
Hey friend!

7
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,007
- Sang Hoon.
- Long time no see.

8
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,370
It’s been a while.

9
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:35,806
About 2 years I think.

10
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:37,280
Where’s Nan Hee?

11
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,045
Behind you.

12
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:43,356
I was here for awhile,

13
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:44,980
you finally notice me.

14
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:48,840
Hey, what's wrong with you?

15
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:51,361
What’s with her?

16
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:55,258
She got dumped by her boyfriend
and showed up like this.

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,529
I don’t know if we should
acknowledge her as a friend or not.

18
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:00,116
We’re still thinking.

19
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,343
Hyung Tae.

20
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:13,692
You smoke now?

21
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,601
I think I'm going crazy.

22
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:20,000
You’re a mess right now.

23
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:25,445
I’m gone for 3 years in the
damn army while you're like this.

24
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:31,176
Nan Hee.

25
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:36,777
When you visited me last time, I want to
thank you for not keeping your promise.

26
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:38,734
Hyung Tae.

27
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:41,435
Seung Won.

28
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:49,140
<i>The first impression was like Scarlet O’Hara.</i>

29
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,713
You’re back.

30
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:56,310
Who’s that?

31
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,645
Isn’t she Yoon Sung Ah?

32
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,965
You know her?

33
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:01,205
She’s visiting Korea.

34
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:04,345
She’s our special guest.

35
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:09,711
I thought she would refuse but
she said okay without a problem.

36
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:14,418
<i>2000 spring.</i>

37
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,088
<i>She came into our lives like the wind.</i>

38
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:19,843
Seung Won, is it hard to learn guitar?

39
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:28,852
Hey! Hey, you know, right?
Answer for me.

40
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,891
Hey! Hey! How can I take roll for you. Hey!

41
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:45,288
Byun Hyung Tae.

42
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,393
He’s not here.

43
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:53,846
Nan Hee.

44
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,636
What about roll?

45
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:55,919
I did it.

46
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,145
What about mine?

47
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,551
Of course.

48
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,283
Can you guys separate a little?

49
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,592
I can see you guys sweating.

50
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,929
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

51
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:28,795
<i>We couldn’t imagine ourselves without her anymore.</i>

52
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,860
Who’s this?

53
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,397
I’m a little nervous because
we haven’t talked for so long.

54
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:44,854
You were the same way when
you were dating. Don’t complain.

55
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:46,304
That’s scary.

56
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,959
You’re trying to get away with it by using my first
dating experience as an excuse, aren't you?

57
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:52,282
Sung Ah's leaving soon.
What are you going to do?

58
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:53,777
She’s not going.

59
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,267
What?

60
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:57,491
She said she'll stay.

61
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:58,680
What?

62
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:00,643
Didn’t she have to make a record?

63
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,367
Aren’t her parents in Spain?

64
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,716
She wants to be with me.

65
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:09,928
How come everything happens
on a whim for her?

66
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:13,076
That’s why I’m worried.

67
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,718
I bet you are.

68
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,578
You’re only 23 and it's not
like you can take care of her.

69
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,472
Wait a minute. Are you even capable to do so?

70
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,526
Think carefully.

71
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:36,051
Nan Hee, what if one day Sung Ah leaves me
just like she decided to leave her career?

72
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,863
You’re both crazy.

73
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:42,155
Yeah , we're both crazy.

74
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,561
It should be okay.

75
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:21,891
It’s raining a lot though.

76
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,571
It’s too much for a hike.

77
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:25,723
It’s not much. I heard it'll stop later.

78
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:28,202
Still that course is pretty rough.

79
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:29,506
Let’s forget it.

80
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,304
Yeah, let’s go after the rain.
We can go tomorrow too.

81
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:35,040
It will be okay.

82
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,779
Let’s just go. It’s Sung Ah’s birthday.

83
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,296
We came to hike and Hyung Tae won’t give in.

84
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,101
You’re right.

85
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:42,423
Let's go.

86
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:58,713
Seung Won.

87
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,101
It’s okay, just go.

88
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,259
- You got it?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:12,001
Seung Won!

90
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,871
What happened?

91
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:16,059
Seung Won!

92
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,164
Seung Won!

93
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:18,637
What do we do?!

94
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,161
Seung Won.

95
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:32,944
<i>Through that accident we lost a friend and
while we were all mourning, she left us.</i>

96
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:36,970
<i>She didn’t leave anything for Hyung Tae,</i>

97
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:41,712
<i>and without any reason, she just left us.</i>

98
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,935
<i>And now, the sadness is barely healing.</i>

99
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:51,897
<i>Why aren’t you coming?</i>

100
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,522
<i>What time are the tickets?</i>

101
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,382
[Love Letter]

102
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,284
[Sung Ah]

103
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,494
Try some kiwi, it's good.

104
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:28,480
Eat a lot okay?

105
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:10,846
<i>It's me.</i>

106
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,458
<i>Say something.</i>

107
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,126
<i>Hyung Tae.</i>

108
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:26,405
Yeah.

109
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,464
What should I say?

110
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,899
<i>Did I come too late?</i>

111
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,351
<i>Since this phone was off, that means
I’m past the expiration date, right?</i>

112
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:47,867
Yes.

113
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:49,924
You're right.

114
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,701
I’m sorry.

115
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,499
<i>You shouldn’t be.</i>

116
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,543
Yeah.

117
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,774
Why should I be?

118
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,524
Byun Hyung Tae!

119
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:12,717
Byun Hyung Tae! You really look like a
member who works for the society.

120
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,660
Why isn’t he coming?

121
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:08,386
He's coming now.

122
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,466
Right here.

123
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:39,758
Can I get some attention too?

124
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:40,771
What's going on?

125
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:43,649
Are you two together again?

126
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:47,088
No. Jun Mo had to meet her
for work, so he brought her.

127
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:58,995
I missed you guys.

128
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:05,219
Hey! You're the one that
left us and now you miss us?

129
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,321
You're right.

130
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:09,881
They seem quite intense with each other.

131
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:13,580
Well... I guess they are a bit.

132
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,640
Do you have any idea what
Hyung Tae went through?

133
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:20,427
Hey, are you guys watching out for me?

134
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,325
You guys are really great.
But I’m okay, so take let's stop the tension.

135
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:30,521
What about us?
We were all best friends, then suddenly...

136
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:33,147
Stop it already.
None of you are kids anymore.

137
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,640
I’m glad you're here.

138
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:45,824
- Nan Hee should ride with me.
- Huh?

139
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:49,620
Let’s go, they should get some privacy.

140
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,532
Does he actually still like her after all that?

141
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:58,133
Does he?

142
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,853
Nan Hee, let's go.

143
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:03,522
We decided to ride with Jun Mo.

144
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,425
Why? We go the same way.

145
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,741
It's okay. You two should talk.

146
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,566
There's nothing to talk about.

147
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,891
Let’s meet again.
We didn’t get to talk much.

148
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,013
Nan Hee, Let’s have a girls' night out.

149
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:18,633
Okay.

150
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,303
What are you thinking about?

151
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:41,678
Huh?

152
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:46,410
That I’m going home.

153
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,519
That's not much to think about.

154
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:53,499
It's pretty important to me.

155
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:54,871
Well then...

156
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:07,297
It doesn’t mean anything whether
Sung Ah is back or not. So don’t think...

157
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:09,570
You don’t have to say it.

158
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:14,680
I know what you're going to say.

159
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:19,099
You want to be alone, right?

160
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,124
No.

161
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:32,168
Don’t you think we don’t get
enough personal time these days?

162
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,055
Here.

163
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,206
You're going to sleep?

164
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,340
Yes.

165
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,285
Alright.

166
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:05,442
Ah! The movie.

167
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,111
Nan Hee.

168
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,132
Nan Hee.

169
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,496
Nan Hee.

170
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,496
I’m sorry.

171
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,116
This time, I kept my promise.

172
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,686
Yeah.

173
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:44,638
Look at that.

174
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:51,241
That's her letting go of the man
she kept in her heart.

175
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:55,200
It's really moving.

176
00:16:57,585 --> 00:17:01,697
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

177
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:09,523
<i>I’m doing fine.</i>

178
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:43,086
You should yell at me.

179
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,046
I said I’m sorry.

180
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,526
You want to hit me?

181
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:54,003
I’m really a bad person.
It was supposed to be our first date.

182
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:59,209
I'll forgive you since you're sorry.

183
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:00,614
Really?

184
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,788
It's understandable since it was
a shocking incident today.

185
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:10,854
Is there another girl as great as you?

186
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:13,677
You're my best friend and my girlfriend.

187
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,632
I’m really a lucky guy.

188
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:23,493
But let’s end it.

189
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:26,715
It wasn’t as if we were officially a couple,

190
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:32,191
but still let's forget about
this confusing relationship.

191
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:33,111
Hey!

192
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:37,623
Sung Ah came back to get with you.

193
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,569
Are you really going to ignore her?

194
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,058
Why does it matter?

195
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,407
I don’t care.

196
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,893
Can’t you trust me?

197
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,070
There's that line all men use.

198
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,029
Nan Hee.

199
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,548
I don’t like this.

200
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:56,480
It's uncomfortable to hear things come out of
your mouth that hasn’t for last 30 years.

201
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:59,787
I think Byun Hyung Tae,
the boyfriend, is whatever.

202
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,695
I can’t even say what I want.

203
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,535
Same for you too.

204
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:07,406
It was so much easier before.

205
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:12,650
When one of us was feeling trashy,
the other would be the trash can.

206
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,904
Sometimes we would cheer for
each other no matter what.

207
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:22,143
We were able to stop and go for each other
and that's the kind of friendship we had.

208
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:28,988
Whenever I wanted to cry,
you were the first on my mind.

209
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:30,661
You probably were the same.

210
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:33,055
Look at us now.

211
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,078
It wasn’t long ago when you spent
my money to go to Spain.

212
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:38,320
I doubt you forgot about her already.

213
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,107
She meant a lot to you.

214
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:45,556
I bet it was killing you inside to act
like nothing happened today.

215
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,426
You're hurting more than anyone right now.

216
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,543
And you're trying so hard to hide that from me.

217
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,146
Don’t you think I know how you feel?

218
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:59,475
Because I know how you feel,

219
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,316
I can’t really do anything.

220
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,493
Damn it, seriously.

221
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:20,138
Hey, are you crying?

222
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:29,132
Be quiet. Can’t you pretend you don’t know?

223
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,258
It was too obvious to pretend.

224
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:37,558
I’m so angry.

225
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:43,971
Do you want a hug?

226
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,542
Oh my.

227
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:02,997
She asked if canceling the phone
meant that I’m over her.

228
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,871
She definitely came back for you.

229
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,501
How did you know?

230
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:15,926
I never thought she would be
back but she came back.

231
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:23,343
I feel better now that I told you.

232
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,034
You like me better as a friend, right?

233
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:34,445
Half and half. I wish there were two of you.

234
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,556
I really do like you.

235
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:47,027
If you didn’t reject me,
I wanted to keep dating you.

236
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:56,077
I don’t think I ever had
that much courage before.

237
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,960
I knew if I told you how I feel,
there was a lot we could lose.

238
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,521
I thought about it and thought about it.

239
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:12,442
But after, it was so much fun.

240
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:20,375
I can finally date someone with ease and joy.

241
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,815
Just the fact I can date like
this at age 30 was great.

242
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:33,733
The hand that I held thousands of times
before became something more.

243
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:39,011
The small jokes I spit out
suddenly had meaning.

244
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,974
I enjoyed it a lot.

245
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:47,786
It amazed me that it was happening.

246
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:52,965
I can’t do this with any other woman,

247
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:59,487
these are things that I can only do with you.

248
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:06,169
As sweet as that sounds, I like it hot.

249
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:08,828
You're talking about that brat.

250
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:14,153
I hope you and Sung Ah
feel something hot as well.

251
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,776
Don’t push me.

252
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:19,679
I’m a little confused.

253
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,189
The ball is on your side now.

254
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:26,383
Just hit it.

255
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:29,731
It will either complete your love,

256
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:34,435
or if it doesn’t work out,
just walk out and leave.

257
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,029
Make sure your heart can have a resolve.

258
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:45,357
At your state now, no matter whom you meet.

259
00:23:45,587 --> 00:23:50,069
Sung Ah will always be in your mind.

260
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:52,705
You think you're so great, don’t you.

261
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:55,312
I’m going to work on my book.

262
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,136
The deadline's coming up,

263
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,688
and I don’t have time to get
in your triangle of love.

264
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:05,480
I’m doing this for my mom,

265
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:06,822
I have to make it.

266
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:10,146
Okay, stop. I got it.

267
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:16,151
Us...

268
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,964
How long do you think we can be friends?

269
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:36,519
When we were in our 20's,
we drifted due to dating.

270
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:40,418
But now we have to get married.

271
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:44,223
We would still see each other.

272
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:47,390
But it's going to be different.

273
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:52,047
I don’t know where we would be,

274
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:58,006
but one day we would say something like,

275
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:07,895
Was there ever a time when
we were actually friends?

276
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:17,239
Stop thinking that.

277
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:20,177
Just go on as much as we can.

278
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:21,927
Okay?

279
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:24,337
Okay.

280
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:32,755
Let’s go.

281
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:36,356
You go in first.

282
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,928
I’m staying for a bit.

283
00:25:55,126 --> 00:26:03,719
12th Inning > It seems like our friendship is coming
to an end at the bottom of the 9th 2nd inning.

284
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:31,767
The hand that I held thousands of
times before became something more.

285
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,215
The small jokes I spit out suddenly had meaning.

286
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:42,455
I enjoyed it a lot.

287
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:46,560
It amazed me that it was happening.

288
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:52,485
I can’t do this with any other woman,

289
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:58,224
these are things that I can only do with you.

290
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:10,381
She should have come back
earlier or a little later.

291
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,737
Worst timing.

292
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:43,287
<i>I liked it too.</i>

293
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:47,303
<i>My heart was so excited.</i>

294
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:22,093
Friend!

295
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,449
Do you want to go running?

296
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,353
Alright.

297
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:29,029
Did you write more?

298
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,218
See it later.

299
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,608
Why?

300
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:34,232
I’m just testing printing.

301
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,413
Let’s go.

302
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,880
Let’s go.

303
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,453
<i>One step closer, one step further</i>

304
00:28:55,675 --> 00:29:00,438
<i>I'm sick of going backward, forward like this</i>

305
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:04,965
<i>If you like me just say so</i>

306
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:09,073
<i>Let's not waste our effort</i>

307
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,324
<i>My love, I love you.</i>

308
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,247
What?

309
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:29,421
Give me the $230.

310
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:32,492
You're breaking up so soon.

311
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,752
This is not damaged, right?

312
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:37,428
I'm selling this on the internet.

313
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:40,263
What kind of relationship is this?
It's not a 3-minute fast food, you know.

314
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:42,353
Yet it's over so quickly!

315
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,313
And what are all these books?

316
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,130
Joo Young's novel is almost ready.

317
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:48,674
I have to look for other writers now.

318
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:52,579
You were dumped?

319
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,824
$230!

320
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:03,724
Yes?

321
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:05,932
<i>Nan Hee! I've done it!</i>

322
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:07,270
What?

323
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:09,639
He said he'll forgive me and
he'll take it as it didn't happen.

324
00:30:09,827 --> 00:30:11,312
That's really great.

325
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:13,644
I've been worried sick,
now I can finally relax a little.

326
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,532
This is really good news indeed.

327
00:30:15,795 --> 00:30:17,794
Why were you worried sick?

328
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,313
Oh, nothing much. It's over now.

329
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:22,549
That's great.

330
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:26,573
- Anyhow, I'm so grateful to him.
- Yes.

331
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:29,928
- Or maybe I should buy him a gift?
- Yes, go ahead.

332
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:31,822
What should I buy?

333
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:34,258
A man who's in his forties...

334
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:35,762
What's good for him?

335
00:30:35,938 --> 00:30:37,985
Forties?

336
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:40,722
Where is it?

337
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:51,141
How about shoes?

338
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:52,580
Would that be too expensive?

339
00:30:52,783 --> 00:30:53,957
Who says so?

340
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:56,642
Even if I had to spend all my salary,
I should still buy it for him.

341
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:58,268
But I don't know his size.

342
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:01,253
Just buy the closest size and
he'll change it if it doesn't fit.

343
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,930
Wait a minute...

344
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:04,983
Director Im,

345
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,073
What size shoes do you wear?

346
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,998
275. Why?

347
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:10,564
Nothing.

348
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:11,743
Hello?

349
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:13,931
Just buy size 275.

350
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:19,124
<i>Sung Ah</i>

351
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,075
So you are here.

352
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,844
Oh!

353
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,260
Are you guilty about something?
Why the scare?

354
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:40,003
So those who are guilty get scared easily?

355
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:43,087
Shall I let you have this spot?

356
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,221
I'll tell you three shocking things,

357
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,138
Shall I start from the biggest item,
Or shall I start from the smallest?

358
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,509
The middle one.

359
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:55,777
You and I will be working on
the same project again.

360
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:58,956
And what will it be this time?

361
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:01,398
I'm fine with it,

362
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,478
You're... Alright with it too?

363
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:07,229
If we win it, it'll be a 3-months long project.

364
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:09,012
A campaign?

365
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,618
The biggest item will have a huge impact on you
so I shall start with the smallest item.

366
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:15,449
What is it?

367
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:18,152
I'm being included by my peers.

368
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,822
You happy?

369
00:32:20,092 --> 00:32:22,550
There's value from splitting up with you.

370
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:27,260
It won everybody's pity hence removing
the distance between me and them.

371
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:32,141
Also, occasionally we gossip about you,
behind your back, pulling us closer together.

372
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:36,752
If I got dumped again, I might even
be the leader amongst my peers.

373
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:42,634
And the most shocking piece of news,

374
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:49,097
This will be our next project.

375
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,457
Hey!

376
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:05,108
You must have a huge headache, right?

377
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:07,855
Stop laughing.

378
00:33:08,243 --> 00:33:12,172
It's true. I myself find it hilarious too.

379
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,462
What do you call this?

380
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:16,850
Hey! Are you Boss Shima Kousaku*?
(*a manhwa character)

381
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:19,614
The territory of girls you've hugged before is really big.

382
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:24,088
This time, even a world class guitarist
will join the crowd?

383
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:31,414
I say, how about try me out too?

384
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:36,155
I won't hurt you.
You just have to follow me slowly.

385
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:40,197
Crushing in a broken can, are you?

386
00:33:40,263 --> 00:33:41,487
Really!

387
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:44,189
Your friend's right.

388
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:48,220
Your first sight of her and your heart's dropped.

389
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,922
Why are you fighting it?

390
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:52,122
Is this still...

391
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,481
Love?

392
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,776
Meet her up then check it out.

393
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,919
On the other hand,
I'm sick of my current situation.

394
00:34:00,262 --> 00:34:01,647
I like Nan Hee.

395
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:07,521
But if I asked her to be with me
as I am right now, it'll only hurt her.

396
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:11,565
If she gets hurt, my heart will ache.

397
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:14,238
See! You're joined together already.

398
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,721
Didn't you say you wouldn't hurt me?

399
00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:20,698
Fine. Then let's sort this out one by one.

400
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,213
When you first heard her voice
on the phone again,

401
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:26,406
What is the word that came to your mind?

402
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:29,270
Sung Ah...

403
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,116
She was calling my name.

404
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,590
Game over.

405
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:35,156
What was that?

406
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,803
You know and yet you ask.

407
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,378
Whether that's love or the remnant
of your missing her,

408
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:44,939
You're not done with her yet.

409
00:34:45,371 --> 00:34:49,044
Hey! Boss Shima, you'd better solve
this before the project starts.

410
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:52,082
Who knows? Maybe you'll have
to meet her often in future,

411
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:55,631
You better not let it affect your work.

412
00:35:06,528 --> 00:35:08,891
<i>Even though living is hard</i>

413
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,306
<i>Even if I fall in love</i>

414
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,558
<i>But someday a good day will come to me too</i>

415
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:19,058
<i>This is the beginning</i>

416
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:23,176
<i>The star of life is me</i>

417
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:27,945
<i>Don't forget who you are</i>

418
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,489
<i>It's okay, don't worry</i>

419
00:35:43,622 --> 00:35:47,224
<i>It's suppose to be hard for everyone</i>

420
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:50,965
<i>After one night's sleep</i>

421
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:54,485
<i>Everything will be fine again</i>

422
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:58,863
<i>I don't know how to give up </i>

423
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:02,195
<i>I'm fine and strong</i>

424
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:07,581
<i>{\a6}Always cheerful and happy</i>

425
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:07,581
[Nan Hee, tonight I'll...]

426
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,582
<i>I will patiently endure it</i>

427
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:10,903
<i>I believe</i>

428
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,474
<i>Even though living is hard </i>

429
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,351
<i>Even if I fall in love</i>

430
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,123
<i>I will never cry or complain </i>

431
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,977
<i>This is the beginning</i>

432
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:23,276
<i>The star of life is me </i>

433
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:25,633
<i>I never don't cry</i>

434
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,282
<i>{\a6}Sad tears goodbye</i>

435
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,282
I want to buy this.

436
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:30,253
<i>{\a6}Hard worries goodbye</i>

437
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:30,253
It's $10.

438
00:36:30,261 --> 00:36:33,253
<i>The beautiful day that I have
imagined last night, here I come</i>

439
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,444
What are you doing here?

440
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,904
This is a book we published,
why pay money for it?

441
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:42,227
Hey! This book is finally out in the market,

442
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:44,409
I want to be the first reader.

443
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:47,232
What great loyalty!

444
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,405
Why are you here?

445
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:54,095
Ah really! I'm being tortured
to death by author Lee Kyung Ha.

446
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,680
What now?

447
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:59,072
Recently, she's hooked on bowling,
she's in a semi-retired state.

448
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:00,419
Guy problems again?

449
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:02,938
What should I do with her?

450
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:03,730
Hey!

451
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:06,085
There's still a little hope in bowling.

452
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:09,795
I was once mesmerized by a financial agent.

453
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,274
Our conversations centred around
adult manhwa and stock market,

454
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:17,251
The chief threw away all the office appliances.
Let's not talk about it.

455
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:25,560
[I'll be late.]

456
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,511
Shall we have a drink together?

457
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:36,680
Ah! Drinks?

458
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,332
Fine. I know a great place.
Shall I show you?

459
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,323
Oh my gosh! Stop fidgeting with it?

460
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:53,896
It's shedding a layer of skin already.

461
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:56,028
This book...

462
00:37:56,267 --> 00:38:01,970
Is the accompaniment into
the next phase of my life.

463
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:03,808
This book...

464
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:08,654
And all that surrounds it,
I'm so grateful for all of it.

465
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:11,978
Manager Hong,

466
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,260
Every time you remember that kid,
your expression changes. Did you know that?

467
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,242
Jung Joo?

468
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:18,408
Yes.

469
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,064
If I describe it in manhwa terms,

470
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:27,781
There should be an “Ah”
speech bubble next to you now.

471
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:31,127
My Jung Joo...

472
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:33,831
I wonder if he's doing well?

473
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:38,220
Is he sick at all?

474
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:41,775
Ah!

475
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,960
Today you seem a little different.

476
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,157
You seem a little mixed up.

477
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:52,254
This, this!

478
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,940
This is the expression when you were
stacked up with that $230 guy.

479
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,873
Oh! Don't tell me this is occupational disease?

480
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:10,270
You gave me a shock!

481
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,157
Are you doing well*?
(*from the Japanese movie "Love Letter")

482
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,078
How are you?

483
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,803
How are you?

484
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:38,639
How are you?

485
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,940
How are you? I said!

486
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:45,675
- Crossing over one step at a time...
- I'm fine.

487
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,613
<i>{\a6}One bright, sunny day</i>

488
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,613
Into the world of author Lee Kyung Ha.

489
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:55,952
<i>{\a6}I'll still hurt a lot</i>

490
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:55,952
Goodbye, Manager Hong.

491
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:00,906
<i>{\a6}Even if I closed my eyes</i>

492
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:00,906
Jung Joo!

493
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:05,047
<i>{\a6}Even if time passed</i>

494
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:05,047
Jung Joo!

495
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:08,849
<i>The memories are still in my heart</i>

496
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,849
How are you?

497
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:18,005
<i>{\a6}Flowers facing the sky</i>

498
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:18,005
Are you doing well?

499
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:24,521
<i>{\a6}I look at you</i>

500
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:24,521
Jung Joo!

501
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,000
<i>My heart keeps growing</i>

502
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:32,627
<i>We're always together yet we're blind to it</i>

503
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:40,339
<i>Like the hands of a clock</i>

504
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,470
<i>Do you see my tears?</i>

505
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:46,872
<i>Do you hear my voice?</i>

506
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:50,245
<i>Don't be too late</i>

507
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:55,589
<i>Come over and hold the crying me</i>

508
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:57,122
<i>You're the only one</i>

509
00:41:57,386 --> 00:42:02,680
<i>You're the only one in this world</i>

510
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:05,923
<i>Who can make me laugh</i>

511
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:09,595
<i>Now I finally realized it</i>

512
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:28,014
<i>I want to say thank you</i>

513
00:42:29,735 --> 00:42:33,762
<i>I want to say sorry</i>

514
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:37,192
<i>But why don't I have the courage?</i>

515
00:42:37,344 --> 00:42:42,244
<i>Why do I say hurtful words?</i>

516
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:45,688
<i>I only realized it now</i>

517
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:50,143
<i>It's you who I love</i>

518
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:53,042
<i>Do you see my tears?</i>

519
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:56,509
<i>Do you hear my voice?</i>

520
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:59,703
<i>Don't be too late</i>

521
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,894
<i>Come over and hold the crying me</i>

522
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:07,452
<i>You're the only one</i>

523
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,549
Hey! You spent the night away,
how lonely is your room mate!

524
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:24,773
Furthermore, it's sauna day.

525
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:28,720
You're feeling embarrassed, right?

526
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:31,215
Yes, a little.

527
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:35,919
Thanks to you, last night I could focus fully
and cleared a milestone smoothly.

528
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,170
What milestone?

529
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:39,942
Someone with writer's block,
finally finished 3 pages.

530
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:41,535
Well done!

531
00:43:41,774 --> 00:43:43,049
And you?

532
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:45,526
Have you crossed the milestone with Sung Ah?

533
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,972
What are you saying?

534
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:49,204
Oh! Good job!

535
00:43:49,386 --> 00:43:52,673
Who says good job?
We just chatted, that's all.

536
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:55,271
What did I say?

537
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:03,226
We decided to start over again.

538
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,568
But,

539
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,974
How did you know I was with her?

540
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,071
Your message was too short.

541
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,373
I'll... be late.

542
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:20,579
Just three words.

543
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:23,269
You must have tussled over what to say,

544
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:27,944
Then finally you chose
the shortest sentence, I'll be late.

545
00:44:31,111 --> 00:44:33,411
Don't bother about me.

546
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:36,196
And don't feel embarrassed about it.

547
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:39,233
Have a happy, passionate relationship for once.

548
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:42,795
Fighting!

549
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:10,170
Can't you be just a little jealous?

550
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,820
Hey! You ignoring me?

551
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:21,983
Hey!

552
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:36,743
[I'll be back after seeing Sung Ah, is this better?]

553
00:45:52,895 --> 00:45:54,514
Give me a moment.

554
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:00,428
What are you looking at?

555
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,226
How does it feel?

556
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:04,503
Your book is published and
the response is good too.

557
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,071
I feel great now.

558
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:12,280
Finally, I found out how to
contact Jung Joo oppa.

559
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:13,992
What were you expecting from me?

560
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:16,102
There must be water in my brain.

561
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,510
We didn't even talk about that.

562
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,076
Well, it's true, that day...

563
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:24,188
You cried so terribly,

564
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:28,317
I don't know how the time just passed.

565
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:35,746
After you left, I was like
a zombie for a long period.

566
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:39,228
Finally, I was fired by the office.

567
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:41,749
I had wanted to go back to live at Jeju island,

568
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:45,619
But I just couldn't focus and my father
had to give me a good beating.

569
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:52,195
After a course of twists and turns,
Nan Hee finally dragged me back to Seoul.

570
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:56,775
Now I eat well and sleep well,

571
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:58,877
And I'm happy in my job too.

572
00:46:59,055 --> 00:47:01,317
I gave you such deep hurts,

573
00:47:01,524 --> 00:47:04,573
Yet you're willing to take me back.

574
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:08,816
I had wanted to push you away,

575
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,656
But I just couldn't do it.

576
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:14,545
Why don't you ask me about it?

577
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:19,530
I knew I'd come running back to you crying,

578
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,766
So why did I choose to leave?

579
00:47:23,595 --> 00:47:25,642
Aren't you curious?

580
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:33,310
Whether I saw your albums or
in news report, it just didn't seem real.

581
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:41,976
But the moment I walked in here,
I understood all about it.

582
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:48,213
Sung Ah is very successful person.

583
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:52,192
A person who was so successful,

584
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:55,819
Was tied down by me for 4 years.

585
00:47:57,477 --> 00:48:00,423
She did the right thing to leave me.

586
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:02,600
Sorry.

587
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:07,151
I'm very sorry.

588
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,551
You don't have to say that anymore.

589
00:48:10,711 --> 00:48:13,908
I'll work hard to make up for it.

590
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:18,177
Your sad period of hurts,

591
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,790
I'll make it all up to you.

592
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,238
There's not even a little echo in this place.

593
00:48:30,422 --> 00:48:34,211
That's how I can hear the most accurate sound.

594
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:38,243
How long do you practice per day?

595
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:40,570
12 hours.

596
00:48:40,956 --> 00:48:42,419
Wow!

597
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:50,369
It's not the same for you, right?

598
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:23,399
[2007 Collection of New Writers' Works]

599
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,648
Ms. Hong, Be careful or your butt
will be stuck to the floor!

600
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:41,369
How could they do that?

601
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,148
Why? What happened?

602
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:47,549
How could they write it so well?

603
00:49:48,347 --> 00:49:49,371
Crazy!

604
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:51,135
You're mad over a book you wrote yourself?

605
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:52,323
I'm really...

606
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,697
Not sure what's all this I've been writing.

607
00:49:55,885 --> 00:49:57,292
What are you saying?

608
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,641
Hey! What happened to you?

609
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:04,829
It's too embarrassing, too ridiculous!

610
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:07,807
Hyung Tae!

611
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:18,520
You write well too.

612
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:22,091
It's hardly half a month to the deadline
for the submission of articles. What should I do?

613
00:50:22,206 --> 00:50:25,686
I read mine again but my work
is too far off, it's not even close.

614
00:50:25,846 --> 00:50:29,467
What if I fail again, Hyung Tae?

615
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:30,992
What?

616
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,050
It's your first reading of
this author and you like it?

617
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:34,673
Yes.

618
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,408
You hardly have enough time yourself so why
do you bother to read other people's work?

619
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:42,926
Let me read it again.

620
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:45,681
I really like your works.

621
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:48,775
What do you like about it?
Which section?

622
00:50:48,944 --> 00:50:50,165
Don't you think it's too plain and boring?

623
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:54,353
Wait...
Have you eaten?

624
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:56,279
Yes. How about you?

625
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:58,136
I've eaten, of course.

626
00:50:58,393 --> 00:51:02,193
Hey, take off that tissue stuck to your face.

627
00:51:04,614 --> 00:51:06,883
You want to become a writer that badly?

628
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:08,378
You think there's no hope too, right?

629
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,770
It's because the deadline's coming and you're anxious,
that's why you're acting like this.

630
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:13,808
In my job, I have such moments too.

631
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,687
Oh my, really!

632
00:51:17,851 --> 00:51:19,418
Calm down.

633
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,924
You want some water?

634
00:51:21,174 --> 00:51:23,325
No.

635
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,624
Luckily, you came.

636
00:51:33,278 --> 00:51:36,719
At least I feel a little more settled.

637
00:51:54,689 --> 00:51:56,835
Oh my goodness!

638
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:02,519
Don't cry anymore.

639
00:52:02,643 --> 00:52:04,598
It's interesting.

640
00:52:04,756 --> 00:52:07,333
- Is it really?
- Yes.

641
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:14,500
But as you get closer to the end,
it loses the plot.

642
00:52:16,276 --> 00:52:18,712
It's alright. Good!

643
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:27,011
<i>Your novel's the best.
Don't you worry!</i>

644
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,992
<i>Getting that author named "So Woon" under
the flagship of your company is not a bad idea too.</i>

645
00:52:39,932 --> 00:52:41,274
<i>Thanks!</i>

646
00:52:41,402 --> 00:52:45,090
<i>And congrats for getting back
together with Sung Ah again.</i>

647
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:48,202
<i>If I have any regrets,</i>

648
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:53,740
<i>It's that from now on,
your life is a finished product.</i>

649
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:59,305
<i>I'm afraid in future the things I can do for you
will become pitifully few so I regret that a little.</i>

650
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:06,770
<i>What do you think?
Not bad, right?</i>

651
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:09,923
Such an impressive writer,
will he work with us?

652
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:12,461
I'll go ahead and try.
It's a new writer anyway.

653
00:53:12,645 --> 00:53:14,758
You're not the only one reading this book,

654
00:53:15,174 --> 00:53:17,412
This must have spread out already.

655
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:18,746
You think it's a good idea, right?

656
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:19,815
I'll just work on it then.

657
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,414
You'll be embarrassed,

658
00:53:23,046 --> 00:53:25,222
This is not a writer we can house.

659
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:27,062
It's alright if I get embarrassed.

660
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,904
Boss, you want to publish
this kind of books too, right?

661
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,759
If it works, it's a heap of money.

662
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:33,946
No.

663
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:35,266
I'll tell her if she gives us
the opportunity to publish,

664
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,527
it doesn't matter if we have
to wait for some years.

665
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:38,621
Yes.

666
00:53:38,866 --> 00:53:42,847
She's new, maybe she'll be touched by that.

667
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:45,045
Why are you so indecisive?

668
00:53:45,212 --> 00:53:50,255
Before the reviewers publish
their thoughts, we have to move fast.

669
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,150
Fine. Let's try!
Do you know the way to contact her?

670
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:55,395
Of course I do.

671
00:53:55,554 --> 00:53:57,281
But is this a guy or a girl?

672
00:53:57,449 --> 00:53:59,222
I think she's a girl.

673
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,660
It'll be better if he's a male.

674
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:06,181
<i>- So Woon...
- Hello?</i>

675
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:10,242
<i>I'm away for now...
I want to become an island.</i>

676
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:11,580
Why?

677
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:18,673
Firstly,

678
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,940
I'm shocked because he's a guy,

679
00:54:21,272 --> 00:54:24,875
Then the recording on the auto-answering
machine is too low-class,

680
00:54:25,008 --> 00:54:26,848
I forgot what I wanted to say.

681
00:54:26,956 --> 00:54:29,091
Why? What did he say?

682
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,185
Firstly,

683
00:54:31,363 --> 00:54:33,290
We should believe in the product, right?

684
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:35,398
Yes, of course.

685
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,905
Then I'll leave a message.

686
00:54:39,727 --> 00:54:40,602
I'm back.

687
00:54:40,788 --> 00:54:41,609
- You're back.
- You're back.

688
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,468
You seem to be in good mood today.

689
00:54:43,622 --> 00:54:45,213
Oh! You bought new shoes!

690
00:54:45,472 --> 00:54:48,300
This? Oh! It's a gift from someone.

691
00:54:48,591 --> 00:54:51,551
So who is it from?
What's the occasion today?

692
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:53,222
It's just from a friend.

693
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:57,246
Seeing you have clean shoes, I feel fresh too.

694
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,517
You should have done that long ago.

695
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:03,138
It seems the response is good for our books,

696
00:55:03,376 --> 00:55:06,534
It's such a treat to be rewarded with a meal.

697
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:08,388
Yes, hello.

698
00:55:08,591 --> 00:55:11,745
[Sung Ah]

699
00:55:13,675 --> 00:55:15,488
Yes, hello, Mr. Writer.

700
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:19,122
I'm Hong Nan Hee from Jang Comics.

701
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:23,526
I hope you'll return my call
when you get this message.

702
00:56:36,374 --> 00:56:39,125
I'm sorry to take you out
from your busy schedule.

703
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:40,821
No.

704
00:56:40,955 --> 00:56:43,563
We'll keep meeting up from now on.

705
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:47,840
When you see me, are you uptight?

706
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:50,930
What needs to be spoken, should be spoken.

707
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,277
Why the sudden silence?

708
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,546
Oh! It's past midnight.

709
00:57:14,756 --> 00:57:17,827
- Sung Ah, happy birthday!
- Hey, why are you saying it first?

710
00:57:18,085 --> 00:57:21,501
Oh, I just can't stand you.
So what if someone else said it first?

711
00:57:21,645 --> 00:57:22,130
- Yes so what?
- I should be the first to say.

712
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:26,745
- Sung Ah, happy birthday!
- Me too!

713
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,418
Thanks, everyone!

714
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,627
Let's sing the birthday song.

715
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:33,232
Happy birthday to you,

716
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,226
Happy birthday to you,

717
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:37,705
Happy birthday dear Sung Ah,

718
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:40,809
Happy birthday to you!

719
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:50,915
It's raining.

720
00:57:52,248 --> 00:57:55,791
It's quite heavy. Can we climb tomorrow?

721
00:57:57,976 --> 00:58:00,468
Why won't they go to sleep?

722
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:21,197
Oh! I'm sorry.

723
00:58:30,937 --> 00:58:35,030
<i>At that time, I was dating Seung Won.</i>

724
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:39,800
After he died, Hyung Tae was
blaming himself for it,

725
00:58:40,105 --> 00:58:45,846
He said it was he who kept pulling Seung Won
along then the accident happened,

726
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,911
I couldn't bear seeing him like that,

727
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:54,923
I felt that it was my fault instead.

728
00:58:59,171 --> 00:59:04,072
So I just pretended that nothing
happened and decided to leave.

729
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:08,722
But from the moment I left, I missed Hyung Tae,

730
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:13,677
And finally I just had to come back.

731
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:19,778
Don't explain any of this to me.

732
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:21,960
I'm...

733
00:59:23,261 --> 00:59:25,408
Starting over again with Hyung Tae.

734
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:28,626
I won't tell him anything, don't worry.

735
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,753
Please...

736
00:59:31,169 --> 00:59:35,339
From this moment on, I will forget it all.

737
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,512
You please forget it too.

738
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:43,575
I'm really thick-skinned, right?

739
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:48,809
Don't mention about that ever again.

740
00:59:50,203 --> 00:59:54,120
Seung Won is not coming back,

741
00:59:54,746 --> 00:59:58,856
Thinking it through, it's no one's fault actually.

742
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:02,582
Let's not make Hyung Tae upset again.

743
01:00:02,736 --> 01:00:04,599
Nan Hee.

744
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:09,925
Hyung Tae wouldn't even get angry at me.

745
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:15,390
I made him hurt so much,

746
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:18,306
Yet he doesn't ask me about it,

747
01:00:18,536 --> 01:00:21,135
Nor does he get upset.

748
01:00:22,482 --> 01:00:25,722
He just held me real tight.

749
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:31,014
That's why I feel even more sorry,

750
01:00:32,492 --> 01:00:38,254
So I want to hang onto him even more.

751
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:59,155
<i>Now it begins to feel a little more real...</i>

752
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:02,965
<i>He doesn't ask and he's not upset,</i>

753
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:08,098
<i>His expression when he came home
after accepting her all over again,</i>

754
01:01:08,987 --> 01:01:13,982
<i>The process of Sung Ah's perfume
transferring onto Hyung Tae's body,</i>

755
01:01:14,494 --> 01:01:19,671
<i>All this surfaced in my brain just as if
it appeared right before my very eyes.</i>

756
01:01:27,105 --> 01:01:30,480
- I'm back.
- Oh, you're back.

757
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:34,534
Who on earth is it?

758
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:41,559
This is number what?

759
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:56,949
Nan Hee.

760
01:01:57,556 --> 01:01:58,699
Sit over here.

761
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,877
No.

762
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:02,349
You two go ahead, I'll just leave.

763
01:02:02,525 --> 01:02:03,819
Why?

764
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:05,659
Sit here.

765
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:14,340
One more cup here, please.

766
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:23,333
Here, cheers!

767
01:02:24,855 --> 01:02:28,709
It's been quite a while since
the three of us last drank like this.

768
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,387
What's this?

769
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,585
Nan Hee, you still draw attention, you know?

770
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:43,944
I know.

771
01:02:44,165 --> 01:02:49,130
I can't do anything about the 8-year age
difference, but I still look quite good.

772
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,560
You get one every Monday,
Who could it be?

773
01:02:52,774 --> 01:02:57,712
Since it's been 5 weeks, it should be in the realm
of a one-sided crush or a stalker.

774
01:02:57,914 --> 01:03:00,914
I thought he would show up after a month,

775
01:03:01,196 --> 01:03:03,010
And I was full of anticipation too.

776
01:03:03,258 --> 01:03:04,776
You have no guesses at all, who it could be?

777
01:03:04,964 --> 01:03:06,134
Yes.

778
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:08,491
At least it won't be some youth,

779
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:10,418
This is not something a hot-blooded youth would do.

780
01:03:10,564 --> 01:03:12,482
That's lucky for me.

781
01:03:12,672 --> 01:03:17,121
If it was a youth, he could be very poor.

782
01:03:17,399 --> 01:03:21,810
I don't care if he's poor,
it just better not be someone I know.

783
01:03:22,087 --> 01:03:23,487
Why?

784
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:33,491
To know someone too well,
is a very tiring thing.

785
01:03:34,635 --> 01:03:36,241
When I see him next time,

786
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:41,951
I'll ask him, "Who are you?
Do you know me?"

787
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:44,857
You're insinuating!

788
01:03:58,323 --> 01:04:02,194
Hey! Are you alright?
You drank a lot.

789
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:11,884
Yes. I'm fine.

790
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:13,881
Let's go.

791
01:04:14,139 --> 01:04:15,643
Yes.

792
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:17,712
You go ahead.

793
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,150
Yes.
