<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, 
thank you for flying with from Madrid.</i>

3
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:24,666
<i>Our expected arrival time is a little after 12.</i>

4
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:34,106
<i>We will continue to serve you to the utmost 
until we have reached Incheon.</i>

5
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:41,780
<i>When meeting women, you need 3 –ing's.</i>

6
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,102
<i>Timing.</i>

7
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,059
<i>Feeling...</i>

8
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,343
<i>Here is the whisky you ordered.</i>

9
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:04,787
Oh No!

10
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,577
Are you ok?

11
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,910
<i>Happening.</i>

12
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,991
<i>The timely mistake of a beautiful woman.</i>

13
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:16,584
<i>It's an expected happening.</i>

14
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,165
Are you ok miss?

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,450
Yes, I'm fine.

16
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,081
I'll clean that up for you.

17
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,391
Would you like another drink?

18
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:27,246
Try whisky, it's better than I thought.

19
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:35,517
<i>Most importantly, situations like this 
always become opportunities,</i>

20
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:38,519
<i>whether it be in life or baseball...</i>

21
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,513
You really don't remember me, do you?

22
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:46,715
<i>which is what I believed until just a second ago.</i>

23
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:56,790
He's pulling out. He Bunted! It was a Bunt!

24
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,745
<i>2nd Inning – There is always a wild card in baseball.</i>

25
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,417
Why didn't you open earlier?

26
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:37,767
What the.. Why are you here?!

27
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,558
What's this bag?!

28
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,246
Why did you come? Are you here for good?

29
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,147
HEY!

30
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:44,559
Why is he here?

31
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,497
Hey, why are you here?!

32
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,400
Are you here for good?

33
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,810
What happened?!

34
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:53,957
WHAT'S THE REASON?!?!

35
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:56,070
Why is he here noona?

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,328
Wait...

37
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,656
What are you planning?!?

38
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:01,545
What if Nan Hee had been here alone?!

39
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,171
What? Nan Hee?

40
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,936
Nan Hee?

41
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:07,295
fine.

42
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,459
Hey Nan Hee, pull up your suspenders, 
your dress looks like it's going to fall off.

43
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:16,495
And you, wipe off the lipstick.

44
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:20,112
Not there, here.

45
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:26,784
Who undid these buttons?!

46
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,590
I didn't do that!

47
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,326
How is it every time you guys are 
together is no longer rated PG?

48
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,597
Are you two hamsters?!?!

49
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,127
Leave!

50
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:38,827
Go where?! This is my house!

51
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:40,457
So what are you going to do?

52
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:43,393
You said someone pick pocketed you 
and took all my money!

53
00:03:43,428 --> 00:03:45,725
Never mind, I'm not interested in that.

54
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:49,260
Give me my money!

55
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,744
Let's live together.

56
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,455
Are you crazy?

57
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:06,537
I'm going to kill you if you try that again.

58
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,141
Why did you say something stupid then?

59
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:12,337
Let's just live together, it's not like you think of me as a guy.

60
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,449
Does that make any sense?

61
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:16,527
Even though you and I...

62
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:17,412
What?

63
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:18,967
I'm a man to you?

64
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:20,844
If you keep acting like that, 
Jung Joo's going to be suspicious.

65
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,056
Noona..

66
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:25,515
That's not it.
Don't you also jump in on this.

67
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,483
He's more simple minded than I thought.

68
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,518
Just stop talking and come with me.

69
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,555
How rude!

70
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,808
Jung Joo, go home for now, I'll...

71
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:41,399
No! I have plans of my own.

72
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:42,741
What plans?

73
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,848
I have a room.

74
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:51,564
Hyung Tae can sleep in my room from now on.

75
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:52,601
Are you insane?

76
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,657
Does it look like I want share a room with you?

77
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:58,022
From what I saw, it looked like 
you guys were having a good time..

78
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,490
Why don't you just go and live with him?

79
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,653
Hey!

80
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,554
Do.. you.. Do you want to?

81
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,565
I'll pay for the management.

82
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,576
Over my dead body!

83
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:15,059
Noona, why are you so quiet? Say something!

84
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,856
Think over it carefully,

85
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,557
that money was going towards this house for six months,

86
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:23,595
and during that time, you were planning on
saving money to get your own house.

87
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,924
If you save $150 a month that you would have spent 
for management, that's $9000 in 6 months.

88
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,872
Isn't this a more favorable situation that I'm back?

89
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:32,786
Also, living expenses will be split down the middle.

90
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:34,734
Stop talking nonsense and..

91
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:37,995
You pay the living expenses too.

92
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,314
Noona!

93
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,552
Why don't you know how to compromise?

94
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:45,560
Fine, then.. Give me my money.

95
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,919
Give me my money!

96
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,470
Either give me my money or go somewhere again.

97
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:56,957
I didn't want to play this card..

98
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,791
Does your mom know about Jung Joo?

99
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,213
That's unfair..

100
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:04,789
It was my last choice.

101
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,330
I'm using the big room.

102
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,834
No more threats.

103
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:13,339
You can't! Why wont anyone listen to me?

104
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,993
Jung Joo, if you think about it, there's nothing to lose.

105
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:19,911
How can you be sure nothing will happen between 
a man and woman? Especially if they live together?

106
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,147
Guys and girls can't be friends!

107
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,929
You haven't lived long enough to know.

108
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:27,477
That's right, Hyung Tae and I...

109
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,990
You've never liked each other?

110
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,076
Can you swear it?

111
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:32,116
Yeah!

112
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,209
How bout you?

113
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,989
It's a secret..

114
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,687
See!

115
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:38,350
See!

116
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:57,890
Did you comfort him well?

117
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,573
Why did you make him worry with your joke?

118
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,930
Let him lose some sleep over it..

119
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:07,690
He doesn't know how to respect his elders.

120
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:08,881
Do you want some ramen?

121
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,038
What are you going to do?!

122
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:11,430
Let's just drop it,

123
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:14,064
there's nothing we can do, it's already done with.

124
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,664
So why did you come early and jumble things up?

125
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:20,220
This is all because you practically chased me out of here!

126
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:23,040
Do you want to start from the beginning? 
Do you want to find our who really started it first?

127
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,780
No! There's nothing we can do now.

128
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,765
What are you writing about?

129
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:44,551
It's not romance is it?

130
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,904
Just shut up and eat your ramen.

131
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,604
It looked like information on the Chosun era..

132
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,530
Why are you looking through other people's stuff?!

133
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,919
What the..

134
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:01,361
Do you want to continue to live like this?!

135
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,330
If I offer to apologize, you should just accept it!

136
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:04,649
Why are you so...

137
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,084
The opening was good.

138
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:40,798
If you don't want to hear comments...

139
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,626
If you joke around with Jung Joo one 
more time, I'm going to kill you.

140
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:46,292
Don't worry,

141
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:49,884
if he asks again, tell him not to worry.

142
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,017
If you want, tell him I'm gay.

143
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:58,335
How far have you read it?

144
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:02,172
To the part when the UFO shows up.

145
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,121
Do you think it's good?

146
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,310
That a UFO shows up in the Chosun era?

147
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,122
There are documentations and it's good material.

148
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,787
Do you want to eat some?

149
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:17,698
Are we going to put some sesame oil in it?

150
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,291
Go grind some sesame seeds then.

151
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,348
Ok~

152
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,636
Marry?

153
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,470
He's still a college student.

154
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,588
That's what I'm saying.

155
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,877
Remember, I'm 30..

156
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:46,018
I keep thinking he may be my last love.

157
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:51,477
Can't I do this a little more?

158
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:55,935
Go ahead Time,

159
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:59,909
it seems Nan Hee is going to be late.

160
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,127
Don't grab me Time,

161
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:06,062
I have somewhere I need to go first.

162
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:12,622
<i>I had proposed to be a healthy 30 year old, 
and Nan Hee one without regret...</i>

163
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,039
I've got all three of these, and this too!

164
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:22,900
You don't have any. Keep going!

165
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:27,696
Does it itch that much?

166
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,890
I shouldn't have trusted you..

167
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,095
Do you think it will be ok,

168
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,834
it seemed like you were bitten by something weird.

169
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:34,888
See a doctor.

170
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:41,595
If this is fatal, I'm going to give it to you before I die.

171
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,162
What!

172
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:51,325
do you see this?

173
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,074
Ha do you see this?

174
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:03,048
<i>We started on different paths, but we ended 
up meeting each other eventually.</i>

175
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,335
Are we going to play this all night!

176
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,038
Keep going!

177
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:14,893
Are you for real?

178
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:19,178
Yea, I heard she ran away from home 
in middle school and picked fights.

179
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:22,109
In high school, something about those problematic kids...

180
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:22,754
The leader?

181
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,590
Yea, supposedly she lived with one of those..

182
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:27,309
Who?

183
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,117
Who lives with who?

184
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:34,374
Me, we're talking bout me.

185
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,173
Nan Hee? That guy we saw?

186
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,963
Nan Hee has a boyfriend.

187
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,420
A college..

188
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:44,090
Professor?

189
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:07,359
Mr. Byun, I thought you were on vacation?

190
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,156
How did you know, were you interested?

191
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:13,242
What if I was?

192
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:15,916
You should have told me before you married.

193
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:17,784
Are you looking for something?

194
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,922
I need some drawings from the Chosun era.

195
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:24,494
Park Ji Sun borrowed them.

196
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,259
Park Ji Sun?

197
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:27,943
Where does she work?

198
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:30,950
She's an intern, and in your team.

199
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:34,085
Isn't your team preparing a commercial relating to this?

200
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,547
Good morning!

201
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:41,437
Why are you here, weren't you on vacation?

202
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:42,879
It didn't work out.

203
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,454
You already cleaned out my desk?

204
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,214
Yea, I did.

205
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,101
In these bad economic times,

206
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:56,760
why would I leave a desk open for someone 
who decides to go on vacation for 6 months?

207
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:04,395
Oh. An intern took my spot.

208
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,109
How did you know it was an intern?

209
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:12,344
Why did you come? Have you finished 
contemplating about life already?

210
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:16,771
I came to get this?

211
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:17,611
Why?

212
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:20,036
I heard you planned this commercial.

213
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:22,679
Wouldn't I be in charge of taking pictures?

214
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:25,862
Shouldn't I prepare if I want to come back to work?

215
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:28,799
Yea, come quickly, we don't have enough people.

216
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,994
I'll be back in 10 days.

217
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,173
Tell the girl at my desk.

218
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,983
How did you know it was a girl?

219
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,738
I could tell just by looking.

220
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,416
I could tell you the name too. Park Ji Sun.

221
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:27,996
Je tu baise.

222
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:29,842
Yea, that's what it was, Je tu...

223
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:37,818
Just look for Eric Satie's album.

224
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:44,032
That doesn't really match the atmosphere here.

225
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,400
Ji Sun, we might have to move your desk,

226
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,417
The owner is coming back.

227
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:14,199
You've been through all of them, that's what you get 
for shopping for all the women in Seoul.

228
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:17,206
You meet one that you hooked up 
with two years ago on the plane,

229
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,355
and the one from a month ago at work.

230
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:23,042
Hey! What if she's an intern at your company?

231
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,604
She said she works at a stock company.

232
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:28,888
I borrowed some research material for you.

233
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:30,008
Really?!

234
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,353
Thanks so much.

235
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,085
Yea, I'm going to be late,

236
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,352
you eat first.

237
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,320
Ok, I'll see you later at home.

238
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:49,125
You've lived together for about a week, right?

239
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:52,373
No that's not it,

240
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,767
he's just a friend..

241
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,031
How did you know,

242
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,692
it's been exactly a week.

243
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:05,692
By listening to your tone I could tell.

244
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:07,865
It's not what you think.

245
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,557
After about 5 more days,

246
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,214
it's going to begin.

247
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:12,227
What is?

248
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:14,698
War.

249
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,803
War?

250
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,193
Who is it?

251
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:29,329
Noona!

252
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:31,079
Jung Joo?

253
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,061
Why didn't you pick up? What were you doing?

254
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,933
The battery must have died.

255
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,769
Aren't you supposed to be training?

256
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:44,889
I ran away.

257
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:45,913
What?!

258
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:47,943
What an idiot.

259
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,486
You two are sleeping together!

260
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,554
How am I supposed to not care?

261
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:01,383
Jung Joo, why are you acting like this?

262
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:05,128
How can I sleep when you're with such a handsome guy?

263
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:09,475
I'm a student with no money, 
and he has a job, a house and a car.

264
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,272
Jung Joo..

265
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:15,985
Choose, is it him or me?

266
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,744
Choose what?

267
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,469
So leave!

268
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,637
No, don't ever meet him again.

269
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:25,575
How can guys and girls be friends?

270
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,033
Jung Joo...

271
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:32,247
It's already 4, go. Do you want to mess up 
your life for someone like me?

272
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:33,951
Someone like you?

273
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:37,554
Do you have any idea how much you mean to me?

274
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,871
I really love you!

275
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:44,828
I know, and I'm thankful, but you have to go.

276
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:47,761
No, choose.

277
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,628
Either you don't see me anymore, or not see him.

278
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,767
Noona, this isn't...

279
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:09,597
Let's go, I'll take you home.

280
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:11,991
I want to stay a little longer.

281
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,557
Really?

282
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,401
Yea.

283
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:42,717
Well it seems you did something with him.. again.

284
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:43,665
Are you going running?

285
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,186
I couldn't sleep because of you.

286
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:50,440
If he does that one more time, I'm calling the police.

287
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:51,770
Really.

288
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:52,599
Let's go together.

289
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:56,025
No, I want some fresh air too.

290
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,320
You two are polluting the environment.

291
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:12,611
I think I should run too.

292
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,790
Don't come.

293
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:16,821
Hyung Tae!

294
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:29,228
Come get me~

295
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:32,941
Crazy..

296
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:43,328
What starts?

297
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:44,848
War.

298
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:46,658
You and me?

299
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,684
Yes...

300
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,994
<i>We've been together since birth.</i>

301
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:56,601
She said I'll find out things about you I never knew.

302
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:58,795
<i>For 30 years.</i>

303
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:05,232
We've known each other for 30 years.

304
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:11,670
<i>I thought that too.</i>

305
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:15,629
What?

306
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:17,992
Why aren't you saying anything?

307
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,006
What?

308
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,914
Is there something on my face?

309
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:24,581
<i>But there was...</i>

310
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:27,466
<i>a Nan Hee I didn't know...</i>

311
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,363
<i>She snores.</i>

312
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,786
<i>I never expected her to be feminine, 
but I'm still disappointed.</i>

313
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,007
Hey!

314
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,111
What?

315
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:56,110
Go sleep in your room.

316
00:20:56,325 --> 00:20:59,317
You took my bed, why do you sleep here all the time?

317
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:03,035
I was working cause I couldn't sleep.

318
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:11,844
I'm so sensitive these days, I can't sleep.

319
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:17,138
<i>It's not like I can say anything, she's still a girl.</i>

320
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,821
What?!

321
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,851
Are you showering? I'm going to work.

322
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:26,585
Make sure to lock the door.

323
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:28,085
Hey,

324
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,882
why do you snore so much?

325
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,115
What?!

326
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:06,300
You're baseball player Kim Jung Joo right?

327
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:10,398
How do you know me?

328
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,332
See! It is him!

329
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:14,196
We really like you!

330
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:16,917
Can we get your signature? We're your fans!

331
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:18,958
I've never done this before.

332
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:21,167
Do it for them.

333
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:23,858
What's your name?

334
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,060
Park Sun Hee.

335
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,927
Oppa, you were awesome last week.

336
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:30,734
You came to the field?

337
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:33,945
Of course, we always go see you.

338
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:37,904
I'm Min Ye Sul.

339
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:43,751
But, who's this?

340
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:49,465
It's my girlfriend. Isn't she pretty?

341
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,473
Don't joke around.

342
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:55,629
She is!

343
00:22:55,664 --> 00:23:00,509
Tell us for real. Do you have a girlfriend.

344
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:02,761
She really is!

345
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,944
I'm not going to give you my signature.

346
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:14,222
Noona,

347
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:18,715
I have to become a junior to wear 
a couple ring, it's our school policy...

348
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,117
<i>They really don't look good together.</i>

349
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:25,194
<i>Yea, he's too good for her.</i>

350
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:28,168
She doesn't seem to have a good 
personality either. I know right?

351
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,040
She might eat us.

352
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,056
<i>Look at the wrinkles on her neck.</i>

353
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,015
<i>How can he date someone like her?</i>

354
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,377
Did you meet Jung Joo?

355
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:11,297
Yes.

356
00:24:11,543 --> 00:24:13,461
Does he finish his homework before meeting you?

357
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:20,454
What does it matter to you if and old me 
hangs out with an immature student!

358
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:25,548
<i>It's getting harder to know her,</i>

359
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,749
<i>just yesterday she...</i>

360
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:29,406
He doesn't have any books?

361
00:24:29,441 --> 00:24:31,646
None!

362
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:37,512
Isn't it summer break soon, doesn't he 
need at least one for summer reading?

363
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:41,671
Like Hansel and Gretel or Cinderella?

364
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,322
There's lots of good books.

365
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:50,565
<i>She had laughed like a crazy woman.</i>

366
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:56,463
<i>How do her mood swings work?</i>

367
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,548
How are over the summer reading and homework different?

368
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,658
It's the same thing.

369
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:13,425
This is why she never gets ahead with publishing.

370
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:16,601
Hey, what is this?

371
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:19,657
Hey!

372
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:20,497
What?

373
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,599
What is this?

374
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,552
I'm developing pictures.

375
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:27,781
Can't you move it when you're not using it?!

376
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:29,261
Did you eat something bad today?

377
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,540
Why are you acting like this?

378
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:33,164
Never mind!

379
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,216
<i>Ok, I'll hold it in since I'm the man.</i>

380
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:59,267
<i>It'll never end if I do start something</i>

381
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:13,807
<i>49,</i>

382
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:16,696
<i>I have no idea how her mood swings work.</i>

383
00:26:19,343 --> 00:26:23,026
<i>After that day, I started to write the things 
I had not known about Nan Hee before.</i>

384
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:26,803
<i>It surprised me there were things I didn't know about her,</i>

385
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:30,365
<i>but I felt that this would prevent me from arguing.</i>

386
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:34,523
<i>I doubt she even knows what I'm doing for her.</i>

387
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,191
<i>48.</i>

388
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:41,034
<i>She's dirtier than I thought.</i>

389
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:45,400
It's so pretty! I need to get that done to myself too.

390
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:50,193
Aren't you going to eat more?

391
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,521
Eat some breakfast.

392
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:55,152
<i>47</i>

393
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:56,027
I can't.

394
00:26:56,062 --> 00:27:00,497
<i>Using a diet as an excuse, she only ate chips.</i>

395
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,688
<i>46,</i>

396
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:11,504
<i>She forgets the money she borrowed, 
but remembers what she lent.</i>

397
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,135
Aren't you going to pay me back?

398
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,535
For what?

399
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,359
Hey, I have to work, can you turn it off?

400
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:22,093
Okay.

401
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,372
<i>45</i>

402
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:31,005
<i>She doesn't let me watch TV because she has 
to work, but she watches all her dramas.</i>

403
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:34,637
<i>43.</i>

404
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:38,951
<i>She donates to environmental groups, but does not recycle.</i>

405
00:27:38,986 --> 00:27:41,437
What kind of man are you, so picky.

406
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:42,833
No you can't!

407
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:44,260
It's ok.

408
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:50,717
<i>Look at this, it's food waste.
(*In Korea you have to separate food waste from others)</i>

409
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:54,888
Ahjussi! You can't hide this like this!

410
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:56,769
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:56,804 --> 00:28:00,142
Look, this black bag,

412
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:07,657
it's obvious what's in it, it's so heavy.

413
00:28:07,692 --> 00:28:10,186
How can you have no conscious?

414
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,835
We have to do this over!

415
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,183
Come help.

416
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:15,488
Yes.

417
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:19,244
What are you doing?

418
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:30,443
Hey! I told you to separate the food waste!

419
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:31,758
Oh, I forgot,

420
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,233
you should have left it, I would have thrown it away.

421
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:36,366
It was smelling, how can I just leave it?

422
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:42,476
Why are you screaming at a person going to work?

423
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:48,522
Ok ok, I'm sorry.

424
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:02,497
Hey...

425
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,403
Remember I paid at the supermarket 
cause you didn't have your wallet?

426
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,224
Can you give me that money now?

427
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:13,187
I didn't go to the bank, I'll give it to you later.

428
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,734
Ok...

429
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:20,843
Hey! When are you going to work.

430
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:23,019
In the afternoon why?!

431
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:27,132
Nothing... it just doesn't look good to rest so long.

432
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:40,922
Let's just see if I ever give her that money.

433
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:44,422
If I paid 3 times, she should pay.

434
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:47,616
And why did she buy pads when I pay?!

435
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,585
What an ass,

436
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:56,876
I brought up the topic so slowly.

437
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,597
He thinks of me as a beggar.

438
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:00,283
Oh! He hit it, he hit it!

439
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:02,519
He makes such a fuss in the mornings.

440
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:06,244
He wakes up at 6, runs, eats, poops, and showers.

441
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,804
Is he some kind of human robot?

442
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,525
Why is he like that when I'm leaving for work?

443
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,152
Why is he like that?

444
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:17,088
It's a run down.

445
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:20,330
He's stuck, just like me.

446
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,502
What if he gets caught?

447
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:27,079
He'll get caught 100%, unless there's a phenomenon.

448
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:16,719
How can he not stand seeing a speck of dust?

449
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:21,616
He watches TV when I'm trying to work and 
runs the vacuum when I'm trying to rest.

450
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:23,008
It's like this isn't it?

451
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:26,875
You don't want to see his face, 
but when you go home it's there.

452
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,388
Yea! It makes me crazy.

453
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:32,561
Soon, even his breathing will start to bother you.

454
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:35,699
It already does. Why does he breathe so loudly?

455
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,709
It's so dirty..

456
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:53,516
My room..

457
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:22,371
How old do I look?

458
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:26,468
Do you want the truth?

459
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:29,006
No..

460
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:38,014
I'll be heading home now.

461
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,632
Didn't you come to work?

462
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,537
I came to turn in my return papers.

463
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:43,995
I'll see you tomorrow.

464
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,406
Bye.

465
00:32:46,342 --> 00:32:47,785
See ya tomorrow.

466
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:52,158
Ji Sun, can you go see if the script is finished?

467
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:53,294
Yes.

468
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,598
Wait!

469
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:15,755
Didn't you say you worked at a stock company?

470
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,589
Didn't you say you worked at a game company?

471
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:27,337
Do you think Director Choi knows 
that you use his name at night?

472
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:31,910
I sometimes use the executive officer's name too.

473
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,852
Let's just say it never happened.

474
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,209
Good Bye.

475
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:43,896
See you tomorrow.

476
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:51,790
Why did he clean my room after I yelled at him?

477
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:02,814
Why did you clean my room?

478
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,844
I was cleaning the whole house.

479
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:07,330
When is this over?

480
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,278
Work, I'll use headphones.

481
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,750
Hyung Tae..

482
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,717
Hyung Tae..

483
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,144
HYUNG TAE!

484
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,402
What?

485
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,180
Do you want one?

486
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,037
Can't you watch that tomorrow?

487
00:36:23,072 --> 00:36:24,694
I have headphones on.

488
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:27,108
I just can't concentrate.

489
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:29,487
Ok..

490
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,863
Sorry.

491
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:46,362
Where are you going?

492
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:49,254
To watch a movie.

493
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:54,256
Just watch what you were watching.

494
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:27,087
What's going on?

495
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:30,342
Our hand model is just not working. 
We'll have to use someone else.

496
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:32,367
You take good pictures.

497
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,915
Like this?

498
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,520
Yep!

499
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:46,577
You're hands are so pretty.

500
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:49,386
How are these the hands of a person, more like an angel's.

501
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:50,351
I've never seen such..

502
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:51,246
Lets get this over with.

503
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:54,411
Ok, did you want something to drink?

504
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:56,964
- Coffee.
- Coffee? Ok!

505
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:08,293
Why are you shaking?

506
00:38:09,382 --> 00:38:11,239
I'm nervous.

507
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:15,264
Why do I have to do this?

508
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:27,899
What the!

509
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,393
I told you I was developing!

510
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:33,675
I need to turn this in by tomorrow!

511
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,014
You went to Spain didn't you?

512
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:42,564
Did you need to ask me that even 
though messing up my work?

513
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,252
Don't you bother me when I work?!

514
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:45,798
So is this revenge?

515
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,613
Are you a kindergartener?

516
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:49,362
What kind of girl are you?!

517
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:50,968
Pick pocketing?

518
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:53,796
You went to meet Sung Ah and 
spent all my money didn't you!

519
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,443
So what if I did?!

520
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:56,471
So what?

521
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,799
How can you say that?!

522
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:01,350
If I had my money would I have live like this with you?!

523
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:03,832
How can you be so bold when you're driving me crazy?!

524
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:07,096
Do you think I enjoy living with you?! I'm tired of it too!

525
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:10,370
I haven't been able to write a single 
word for a week because of you.

526
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,623
If it's something you can't write with your hands 
and feet tied behind your back, forget it

527
00:39:13,658 --> 00:39:15,247
Are you the only one that does art?

528
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:16,750
I can't live with you!

529
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,500
I really can't!

530
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:20,717
I also feel that way.

531
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:22,719
I'm going insane.

532
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:24,069
Idiot.

533
00:39:24,376 --> 00:39:25,860
Look at how you live!

534
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:28,197
This is why Sung Ah left you!

535
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,332
What are you doing here?

536
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,678
I wanted to eat your food.

537
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:06,894
Come in, I was about to eat,.

538
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:10,331
Why are you eating alone?

539
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:12,571
Your sister is eating out with your brother in law today.

540
00:40:12,606 --> 00:40:13,792
You should have called,

541
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:16,528
I would have gotten that fish you like so much.

542
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:18,553
Why are you nice suddenly?

543
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:20,926
Are you sure you're my mom?

544
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,264
I'm feeling good today.

545
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:26,059
Does seeing me make you that happy?

546
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:29,650
Should I move in again?

547
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:31,538
That's not it,

548
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:35,055
your sister, she's pregnant!

549
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,744
That fortune teller, he was right!

550
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:40,399
My arthritis seems a little better.

551
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:49,606
Mom, what's all this stuff in my room?

552
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:51,689
It's stuff for the store.

553
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:54,252
It's no use leaving an empty room.

554
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:58,326
When the baby comes, we'll have to clean it out.

555
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,857
How can you get rid of my room as if 
you were more than ready to?

556
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:39,486
Is he hurt?

557
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:51,548
You're able to sleep after riling me up so much?

558
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:11,148
Noona!

559
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:14,447
She's my girlfriend.

560
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:21,196
Your clothes stand out too much.

561
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:28,423
You should have told me who was going to be here.

562
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:30,279
What's the difference?

563
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,059
Sit and eat.

564
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:35,635
Noona, you're buying right?

565
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,423
Of course she is.

566
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,176
Thank you Noona.

567
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:40,376
Thank you.

568
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:43,081
Why does she have to pay, everyone pay up!

569
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:45,751
Do you think we would let her off the hook?

570
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:49,800
This is why having a working girlfriend is good.

571
00:42:49,835 --> 00:42:51,081
Right noona?

572
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:52,973
Isn't that right?

573
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,830
Ok, I'll buy.

574
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,267
It's ok.

575
00:42:58,635 --> 00:42:59,648
Do you have money?

576
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:01,224
Of course!

577
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:16,952
Sing a song! (chanting)

578
00:43:29,736 --> 00:43:34,266
A new song, new song (chanting)

579
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,942
What is that?

580
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:49,695
<i>Jung Joo is too good for her.</i>

581
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,337
<i>How old is she?</i>

582
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,926
Let's break up.

583
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:21,860
I'll take you home.

584
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,587
Let's stop seeing each other.

585
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:26,740
Why are you acting like this again?

586
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,075
No, I don't want to.

587
00:44:28,904 --> 00:44:31,052
I'm not breaking up with you.

588
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,641
Let's stop.

589
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:36,681
It's because of Hyung Tae isn't it?

590
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,365
I told you it wasn't,

591
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,929
why do you keep making me repeat myself? He's just a frie..

592
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:46,873
Think what you want.

593
00:44:46,908 --> 00:44:48,791
No, I'm sorry,

594
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:51,799
I wont say that again.

595
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:54,346
I mean it!

596
00:44:55,156 --> 00:44:59,836
Just don't say let's break up.

597
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:02,875
Please don't do this.

598
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,590
Jung Joo...

599
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:07,398
It's not like that.

600
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:14,548
It's hard for me.

601
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:17,172
Is it because the guys were mean to you?

602
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:20,395
Did someone say something?

603
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,842
Was it Eun Suk, that kid that was making fun of you?

604
00:45:24,877 --> 00:45:26,146
Jung Joo..

605
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,494
It's too embarrassing.

606
00:45:34,169 --> 00:45:35,442
Noona,

607
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,828
do I embarrass you?

608
00:45:44,797 --> 00:45:47,878
I'm proud of you,

609
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:54,584
but I'm embarrassed of myself.

610
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:28,275
Are you 20?

611
00:46:28,505 --> 00:46:30,929
Why are you showing so much skin? 
It's an unsightly public display.

612
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:39,141
Hey! Do you have any idea how much trouble 
I was in because of those pictures?

613
00:46:41,054 --> 00:46:43,126
Fine, lets have a go at it.

614
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:44,921
Let go!

615
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:49,724
Do you think I'll let you off the hook cause you're a girl?

616
00:46:57,328 --> 00:47:00,239
Let's end this today!

617
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:03,895
Either you leave, or I leave!

618
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,136
Fine, let's!

619
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:07,179
Fine!

620
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:45,847
I told you we shouldn't have lived together.

621
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:53,675
I think it was a better idea than dating.

622
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:59,214
Let's end this and never see each other again.

623
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:02,234
Shut up and drink. It's your turn.

624
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:09,437
You broke my car turn signal didn't you.

625
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:12,357
I told you it wasn't me for the 12th time, you stubborn ass.

626
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,133
You're a mental patient aren't you?

627
00:48:14,168 --> 00:48:17,068
How many times have I been tricked 
by your careless responses?

628
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,230
Number 26,

629
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:19,918
she lies like she eats.

630
00:48:19,953 --> 00:48:21,501
You've even been through my room?!

631
00:48:21,536 --> 00:48:23,497
Did I tell you to sleep on my bed?

632
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:25,459
You have the worst personality.

633
00:48:25,494 --> 00:48:27,220
The list you made,

634
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:29,197
that's proof that you're a patient.

635
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:33,513
It's people like you that go murder people.

636
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,614
Shut up and drink!

637
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:37,408
Ha, way to copy me.

638
00:48:43,946 --> 00:48:45,767
Ok, let's go to the end.

639
00:48:45,802 --> 00:48:49,240
You were planning to do that from 
the beginning, weren't you?

640
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:53,302
It just amazes me that I didn't know you.

641
00:48:53,337 --> 00:48:57,738
The 30 years I spent with a beggar 
like you seem like a waste.

642
00:48:57,773 --> 00:48:59,253
Ha is that so?

643
00:48:59,288 --> 00:49:01,966
I didn't learn anything new about you,

644
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:06,651
but the more I got to see, the more I realized 
you were such a neurotic, petty person.

645
00:49:07,188 --> 00:49:08,581
Petty? You crazy..

646
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:09,910
What you -

647
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:11,170
What a -

648
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:12,598
You insane -

649
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,562
Did you drive you head into a plane, what the..

650
00:49:14,597 --> 00:49:16,407
I did drive it into a plane you,
did you take a bullet to your head?

651
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:43,613
From what I've seen, you can never 
live together with someone else.

652
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,349
That's too much of a luxurious life for a girl like you.

653
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:49,191
Just go back to your mom and live like she tells you.

654
00:49:49,226 --> 00:49:51,920
Don't go messing up anyone else's life.

655
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:56,468
You fell over, disgusting girl.

656
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,185
I'll pay.

657
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,041
In having to never see you again, I'm glad to.

658
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:14,078
I don't even have a place to go.

659
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:17,769
It's double or nothing for me.

660
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:22,747
Drink!

661
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:28,790
Why the hell did you leave your house 
when you don't have the ability?

662
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,149
It's all your fault.

663
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:39,498
If you let for vacation, even if you get bombed or bit 
by a snake, you should have kept your promise.

664
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:41,094
Go throw up.

665
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:44,813
On your way, poop, shower and go to work.

666
00:50:44,848 --> 00:50:47,365
You said that's the order you do things! Pervert..

667
00:50:53,987 --> 00:50:56,304
Shut up and drink.

668
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:57,808
Fine!

669
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,108
You drink too.

670
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,248
You seem to be getting tired.

671
00:51:22,283 --> 00:51:24,519
Sit up straight you jerk!

672
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,276
Give up before you die, I don't want to be arrested.

673
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:33,564
How can you have no sense of 
conceding when you're a guy?

674
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:38,582
If you want a guy to concede, become a girl first.

675
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,104
I am a girl!

676
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:44,206
Is 30 not a girl?

677
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:48,871
Is that why you wore clothes like that?

678
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:52,033
You're a set with children cartoon characters.

679
00:51:54,151 --> 00:51:55,159
Stop it.

680
00:51:55,194 --> 00:51:59,091
They say that people become lenient when in love,

681
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,819
look at the relationship you're having.

682
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:04,507
Nan Hee,

683
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:09,307
how can you go so low?

684
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,806
Giving up?

685
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:27,598
Just live like you are right now.

686
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:33,240
Grown old tired and lonely and 
die a sorrowful death you ass!

687
00:52:45,585 --> 00:52:50,677
I'll die like that so get out of my house.

688
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:55,741
How can she curse me like that?

689
00:52:57,276 --> 00:52:58,841
Cursing me out till the end.

690
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,865
I miss Jung Joo,

691
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,558
I should call him.

692
00:53:08,593 --> 00:53:10,806
Where's my phone?

693
00:53:19,372 --> 00:53:23,998
How can Hyung Tae acting like that?

694
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:44,291
Text message.

695
00:53:44,326 --> 00:53:45,611
Give it to me.

696
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:52,218
Look at his grammar!

697
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:54,320
What is this?

698
00:53:59,822 --> 00:54:01,506
Give it to me!

699
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,190
Give it to me.

700
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:15,421
Ow my legs.

701
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:16,691
My legs...

702
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:28,014
Hey, what happened?

703
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:30,032
Ouch, my stomach.

704
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,015
I don't know.

705
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,336
Do you remember how we got home?

706
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,344
We probably walked.

707
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:46,292
Do you know where my cardigan is?

708
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:50,051
You gave it to the waiter because you were hot.

709
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:52,395
Oh yea, I did.

710
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:56,595
Hey, whoever blacked out first goes.

711
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,038
Ok.

712
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:01,859
After that, the waiter gave us free drinks.

713
00:55:01,894 --> 00:55:03,647
And I asked for Queen music after.

714
00:55:03,682 --> 00:55:06,889
The manager turned it on. 
You requested the Beatles.

715
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:08,132
You don't remember do you?

716
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:09,662
Of course I do!

717
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:12,814
You came back after you threw up and fell trying to sit down.

718
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:15,499
I didn't fall, you pulled the chair from under me.

719
00:55:15,534 --> 00:55:17,694
How immature.

720
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:23,215
And then, we continued drinking 
and you went to the restroom.

721
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:26,300
Did I cry in the restroom?

722
00:55:26,984 --> 00:55:30,805
Did I cry yesterday?

723
00:55:31,557 --> 00:55:33,399
I think you did.

724
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:37,616
You came out without your shoes.

725
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:38,625
Me?

726
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,887
And then...

727
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:43,693
a text message, no phone call.

728
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:52,208
I lost,

729
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,187
I don't remember.

730
00:56:06,593 --> 00:56:08,584
look at his grammar.

731
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:11,596
"I'm sorry it were hard for you all this time... "

732
00:56:13,836 --> 00:56:16,322
<i>I'm sorry it was hard for you all this time.</i>

733
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,072
<i>Let's break up.</i>

734
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:21,202
<i>I'll do that for you.</i>

735
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:24,892
Give it to me!

736
00:56:35,014 --> 00:56:38,052
Mister! One more bottle over here!

737
00:56:40,986 --> 00:56:42,347
You guys broke up?

738
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:45,528
Shut up about Jung Joo and let's continue.

739
00:56:45,563 --> 00:56:47,369
This time, I..

740
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,403
Damn.

741
00:56:53,232 --> 00:56:55,553
Nan Hee, look at me.

742
00:56:55,588 --> 00:56:59,378
Hyung Tae, what should I do?

743
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:07,197
I miss him so much.

744
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,426
What are you doing taking that pot?

745
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:51,536
I'll be going.

746
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,696
Do you have a place to go?

747
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:58,662
Even if I didn't I have to go, 
we can't live together.

748
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:01,455
You know this.

749
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:29,951
Why the hell did she have to break up with him now?

750
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,605
Hong Nan Hee!

751
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:11,728
Hey he's safe!

752
00:59:11,763 --> 00:59:14,164
I thought you said it was 100% he's out!

753
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,566
I said as long as there's not a phenomenon.

754
00:59:19,052 --> 00:59:21,935
<i>However, there's always one in baseball.</i>

755
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:42,545
<i>Like always, inevitability always comes 
around under the cloak of destiny.</i>

761
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:58,262
Me?

762
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,117
What are you doing?!

763
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:07,039
If you come, I'll kill you!

764
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:10,274
<i>I can't think. I can't see anything.</i>

765
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,756
Mom!

766
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,858
<i>Who is this?!</i>

767
01:00:14,893 --> 01:00:17,432
I heard you two aren't married.

768
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:19,972
I had a hard time finding the seat.

769
01:00:20,555 --> 01:00:22,254
Who are you?
