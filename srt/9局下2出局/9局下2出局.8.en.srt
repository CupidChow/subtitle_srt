00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:39,263
How should I hold it?

3
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:42,175
Wait a minute... I will show you.

4
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,251
Hey, Mi Kyung.

5
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,381
Are you studying?

6
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,662
No.

7
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:02,226
I had to do something so I'm outside.

8
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:05,733
Name brand...?

9
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:09,256
Because I have had my hands off that league for a while...

10
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:10,423
Hmm...

11
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:14,300
<i>When you are done with your errand,
will you make some time for me?</i>

12
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:17,130
Uh... that is...

13
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:18,334
<i>You don't have to rush.</i>

14
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,039
<i>I took the day off today and have a lot of time.</i>

15
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:23,071
Wow.

16
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:24,596
Loan: $0.
(*She is done paying off her loans)

17
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,377
It's touching.

18
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,692
This account, you made it while paying off your debt?

19
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:32,531
After father passed away...

20
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:35,804
There was exactly $100,000
debt that fell in front of me.

21
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,519
I had just graduated high school,
and thinking I had to pay that back.

22
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:40,857
The path ahead of me seemed dark.

23
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:45,620
The first day I got paid, I held Nan Hee's
hand and went to pay the interest.

24
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:46,677
It was Nan Hee's doing?

25
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:48,027
Hmm.

26
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,446
She opened a account for me by putting $10 in it.

27
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:54,351
She said every month I paid
interest to try and fill this up also.

28
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:56,408
The day I cleared my debt.

29
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:59,500
I thought I would take the day off from work
and forget my mom, my younger sibling.

30
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,841
I would use this in one shot only for me.

31
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:06,322
But I need to know something to spend it.

32
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:08,608
It is a true bonus.

33
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,351
You have the right Chun Hee.

34
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,657
Use it all.

35
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,173
Mi Kyung.

36
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:18,849
What would be good for all my troubles?

37
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:21,679
Pick a killer present for me.

38
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,988
You know what's expensive and good.

39
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:26,301
Where is such a thing?

40
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:29,431
Whatever you buy, it won't add up
the 10 years of your toils.

41
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:32,599
What can you buy in order
for your youth to be reimbursed?

42
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,855
$1200

43
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,873
This is $300

44
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,608
So together $1500

45
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:52,959
What is this?

46
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,366
Money that was originally planned for a murder.

47
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,652
A terrible kind of money.

48
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,130
By any chance...?

49
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,621
What I was thinking was correct.

50
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:08,292
I knew it when you ate 9 sweet potatoes.

51
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:10,354
When I got your phone call...

52
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,011
The baby said,

53
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,454
"Mom, this is a chance."

54
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:21,427
"Let's quickly get out of here, hmm?"

55
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,426
I called at just the right time.

56
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:29,030
You did good, friend.

57
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,276
What is it? Did something...?

58
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:50,499
Oh~

59
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,828
Make-up!

60
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,411
Your outfit is killer.

61
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:55,365
You don't really have to be touched up.

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,733
Are you going someplace good?

63
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:58,339
Uh, that is...

64
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:01,500
But what is this?

65
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:04,315
You said something big happened
and called me from work.

66
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:09,158
What? A nude photo shoot?

67
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:10,498
Are you crazy?

68
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,820
My whole youth has passed
while trying to pay off that debt.

69
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:13,786
Yes.

70
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,050
You worked hard.

71
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:16,791
I am so proud of you.

72
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:18,456
But...

73
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,038
What does that and the nude photo shoot
have to do with each other?

74
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,981
We are in our 30's now.

75
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,944
Which means our major league is also coming to an end.

76
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,740
This small amount of youth we have left,
let's take a picture and treasure it.

77
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:32,781
It's you, isn't it?

78
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,622
Who started this crazy thing?

79
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:38,278
Yes, it was my idea no doubt,
but she dragged me in.

80
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:40,641
She says she cannot do the shoot alone.

81
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:41,996
You two do it.

82
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,001
I can't do it.

83
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:44,575
No way!

84
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:47,462
If you don't do it, I won't do it either.

85
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:48,776
Mi Kyung!

86
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:53,166
Don't be like this you guys~

87
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:57,621
Chun Hee we will cheer you on from the side.

88
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:00,594
And the money left over from the shoot,
we'll use it on something else more meaningful.

89
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,585
Oh.

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,911
If you really don't want to take the picture alone.

91
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:09,840
This savings book... this is good.

92
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,854
Let's get really good lighting and take the picture.

93
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,892
Put it in your house.

94
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:18,830
I have a really important appointment, and I'm busy!

95
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,025
Are you guys really going to be like this?

96
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,332
I really want to take it,
but I have no courage to take it alone.

97
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:26,516
Hey.

98
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:30,833
My body that wasn't able to get any
attention in its 20's not even by me...

99
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:32,727
Don't you even feel sorry for my body?

100
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:34,487
I will look for you.

101
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,324
Oh~

102
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:39,937
I want to remember my youth that I worked so hard for.

103
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:44,170
That has more value than any designer thing.

104
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,052
Shouldn't at least I remember?

105
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:55,441
Rock, paper, scissors.

106
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,764
Yes.

107
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,681
Rock, paper, scissors.

108
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,801
Okay.

109
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:10,828
Hey, should we run after she takes the picture?

110
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,479
The locker key is in Chun Hee's pocket.

111
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:16,145
Ugh, I'm going crazy.

112
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:19,497
Let me see.

113
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,549
Wow~

114
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:24,311
Why is it okay?

115
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,076
Misses are truly different.

116
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,087
Yours is better.

117
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,789
Looks like you really have an appointment.

118
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,142
I'm going to go answer his proposal question.

119
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,453
You're going to get married, aren't you?

120
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:00,948
Yes.

121
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,924
I'm having my third baby, I think.

122
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,160
What?

123
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:10,777
Here, we are going to start.

124
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,696
<i>Even though living is hard.</i>

125
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:24,230
<i>And I fall down in love.</i>

126
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,999
<i>A good day will also come to me.</i>

127
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:29,440
Congratulations.

128
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:31,694
<i>Now is the beginning...</i>

129
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,522
But you must have a lot of worries.

130
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:35,840
<i>The star of life is me.</i>

131
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:33,744
Back to you.

132
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:40,200
<i>Don't forget who you are...</i>

133
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,219
Is there really that much to life?

134
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,440
Things you cannot get rid of even if you try...

135
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:42,665
Let's just enjoy.

136
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:45,616
Yeah, lets.

137
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,794
<i>It's okay do not worry.</i>

138
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,467
<i>It is hard for everyone.</i>

139
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,885
<i>After a night of sleep...</i>

140
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,443
Chun Hee is really pretty.

141
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:07,266
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

142
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,236
<i>I don't know how to give up.</i>

143
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:13,788
We used a lot of money on a huge excess.

144
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,120
<i>I'm fine and strong.</i>

145
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,150
<i>Strong and cheerful...</i>

146
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:22,737
To hold onto our youth forever... a huge excess.

147
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:23,495
<i>I will endure it. I believe.</i>

148
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,305
<i>Even though living is hard.</i>

149
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:27,102
<i>And I fall down in love.</i>

150
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:30,971
<i>I will not cry or whine.</i>

151
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:32,743
<i>This is the beginning.</i>

152
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,944
<i>The star of life is me.</i>

153
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,466
<i>I'm never gonna cry.</i>

154
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,369
<i>Goodbye sad tears.</i>

155
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,259
<i>Goodbye hard worries.</i>

156
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:44,100
<i>The amazing day I dreamed of last night.</i>

157
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,761
Hey Kim Jung Joo.

158
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,079
<i>Is waiting for me.</i>

159
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,658
Stop now and get out.

160
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:48,045
<i>Today is the beginning.</i>

161
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,428
It's almost time.

162
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:50,754
Stop now and let's go.

163
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,427
<i>I am going to do well.</i>

164
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:52,761
I will take you to the station.

165
00:08:52,494 --> 00:08:53,803
<i>Smile again.</i>

166
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:56,744
<i>Okay.</i>

167
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,133
<i>That's good.</i>

168
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:02,591
<i>Don't look up too much.</i>

169
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,698
<i>That's good.</i>

170
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:06,132
<i>One moment.</i>

171
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,112
<i>It's okay.</i>

172
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:10,973
<i>Look and see.</i>

173
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:14,742
<i>Always cheerful and happy</i>

174
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:18,771
<i>I will patiently go on.</i>

175
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,842
Oh, I'm being emotional.

176
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,682
All kinds of thoughts are coming to my mind.

177
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:22,259
<i>I will win.</i>

178
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:26,510
<i>Even if the rain storm comes.</i>

179
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:30,024
<i>Strongly.</i>

180
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:34,013
<i>Cheerful.</i>

181
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:37,914
<i>I will always endure it.</i>

182
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:54,137
<i>In my life, the greatest excess is not right now,
but that I had already experienced it.</i>

183
00:09:55,287 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>But that the days of my youth which I just let pass by,</i>

184
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,721
<i>were the real excess.</i>

185
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:09,211
<i>As I bid farewell to my youth,</i>

186
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,330
<i>I only realize now this important fact.</i>

187
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:14,542
<i>It is always like this.</i>

188
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:19,286
<i>When I realize something it is already too late.</i>

189
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,705
Because you wanted to catch this chance.

190
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:26,590
You even gave up an opportunity to be in

191
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:29,438
a pro league as after you graduated high school.

192
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:30,892
Dad.

193
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:33,037
Starting from the rookie league and going to

194
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:36,484
the major league is a near impossible thing.

195
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,336
Especially for an Asian.

196
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,817
You know?

197
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,821
Did you start without knowing?

198
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:48,221
Me and mom was against it so much,
but you said...

199
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,217
That you didn't even care if you
started in a rookie league,

200
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:52,981
because you were going to go to the major leagues.

201
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,599
After making it...

202
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:58,224
does that life seem to hard and silly?

203
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,286
Is that it?

204
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,646
Since you haven't given an answer to the agency yet,

205
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,419
does that mean you're still undecided?

206
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,469
It was your last chance.

207
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,751
Jung Joo, can you give it more thought?

208
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:22,559
<i>I should have realized it a little earlier.</i>

209
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:27,861
<i>Of how much an excess Jung Joo's love was to me.</i>

210
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,621
<i>But like always...</i>

211
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:37,066
<i>When I realized something it was already too late.</i>

212
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:43,861
<i>Goodbye... my major league.</i>

213
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:49,454
<i>Goodbye... my love that may have been my last love.</i>

214
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,436
It's harder to say it than I thought.

215
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,453
Say it.

216
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,642
Say what you want to say.

217
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,588
Comfortably.

218
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:43,738
Jung Joo, you are 22 years old.

219
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:48,479
But from now on, you may not be able
to play the way you want to.

220
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:51,670
You may also have to stop yourself
from enjoying the things you want to.

221
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:56,833
At your age, those things are important too.

222
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,046
When you look back, all those things are your wealth,

223
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:04,909
your sparkling memories,

224
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:07,699
and the source of motivation for living out your future.

225
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:15,340
It seems I have even done a few crazy things.

226
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:18,012
But you will be tied up by a family,

227
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:21,119
and you may not be able to do those kinds of things.

228
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:27,213
Becoming an adult faster than
other people will be very painful.

229
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:33,183
You may even have to take responsibility
for things you are not ready for yet.

230
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,058
It is going to be a lot harder
to handle than you imagined.

231
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:46,505
I was able to experience a lot of different loves.

232
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,563
But you will not be able to...

233
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:52,108
experience love with a different
woman for your whole life.

234
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:57,511
Looking at your life, that is also a loss.

235
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:04,492
Beside those things, this and that.

236
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,687
About us getting married...

237
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,098
Compared to many other marriages.

238
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:17,103
You would have to give up a lot more...

239
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,497
But still,

240
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:25,588
is it really okay?

241
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:28,776
Will you not regret...

242
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,423
Marrying me?

243
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:01,704
Cheers!

244
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:02,766
Cheers!

245
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,917
Exactly how many times are we cheering?

246
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,745
Ji Sun, one shot, one shot.

247
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,065
It's hard for me, team leader.

248
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,285
You are attacking Ji Sun too much.

249
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,547
Stop giving it to her.

250
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,382
Our pretty Ji Sun.

251
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,077
We won't see her often after this project.

252
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:24,217
She is not even part of our team.

253
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:27,563
That's why I'm sad.

254
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:29,435
Aigoo, foolish, foolish.

255
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,059
Stop it.

256
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:31,701
You. Yoon Kyung!

257
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:33,334
You, really...

258
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:34,191
Me what?

259
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:34,813
Me what?

260
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:35,655
What? What? What?

261
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,342
You two are talking informally to each other.

262
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,641
Why you want to talk informally to me too?

263
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,379
Do you know what kind of days these are?

264
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:45,719
To offer drinks to a woman worker?

265
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:46,859
Making me not want to see you.

266
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,118
Yoon Kyung!

267
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:54,105
For you, this... ah.

268
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,693
Ah~

269
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,576
Drink, drink, drink.

270
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:06,788
Really?

271
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:08,703
Pretend not to know.

272
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,495
Because only a few people know.

273
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,559
Yes.

274
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:14,554
But I was really surprised.

275
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,681
How can Mr. Park and Ms. Yoon?

276
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:20,681
It's already been about 10 years.

277
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:22,103
That long?

278
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,500
Why won't they get married?

279
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,945
Because Ms. Yoon's family is strict.

280
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,101
They won't allow her to marry a divorcee.

281
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:32,176
So they can't get married.

282
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:34,857
So they have been going out
and breaking up for 10 years now.

283
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,238
Ah.

284
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:38,697
Those years must be horrible.

285
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,486
Now it's more that they are used
to each other than love.

286
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,667
And that is more horrible.

287
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,595
Used to?

288
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:50,178
There sure are all kinds of love.

289
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:51,734
Yeah.

290
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:56,068
We are here.

291
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,407
Do you want go around one more time?

292
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:00,953
One moment.

293
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:02,998
Yes father.

294
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:04,638
Why are you calling at this hour?

295
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,067
Oh, of course. It's our annual event, I'll go.

296
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:13,069
I got the airplane tickets.

297
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,007
I understand.

298
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:18,792
Yes, go to sleep.

299
00:17:19,764 --> 00:17:21,389
What are you so curious about?

300
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,629
His voice is very similar to yours, oppa.

301
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:24,701
Really?

302
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:26,931
But what is the big event?

303
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,137
Fishing.

304
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,763
Wow. Can't I go too?

305
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:32,817
I've always wanted to fish.

306
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,744
Uh, let's go together another time.

307
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:41,296
Because this is a trip I go with my father every year.

308
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:43,334
Ah~

309
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:46,455
Next time, I will take you a better place.

310
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:49,018
I know of a really good fishing spot.

311
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,583
Okay.

312
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:57,548
You said you wanted go around once more.

313
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:01,005
No, it's okay we have gone around three times.

314
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,365
Now you are awake, right?

315
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,613
Yep.

316
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:04,983
Then go.

317
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,160
Okay.

318
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,469
Bye.

319
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:25,291
What time is it that she's still not home?

320
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:29,570
Did they already start a family or something?

321
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,127
Hey.

322
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:50,253
What's wrong? Are you sick?

323
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,868
I don't smell alcohol.

324
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:53,685
Hey?

325
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,939
Have you gone crazy?

326
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,798
What's wrong?

327
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:01,341
Hey, hey...

328
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:05,217
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

329
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:05,783
Give me that.

330
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:06,945
What did something go wrong?

331
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,625
You even got a flower bouquet.

332
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:10,564
Ah! That feels good.

333
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,161
Hey bring mine also. Quickly!

334
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,271
Yours?

335
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,815
They were not of joy,

336
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,746
but tears that came from deep of his stomach,
which he was vomiting.

337
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:39,724
Why?

338
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:42,083
I don't know, and that's why I don't feel good.

339
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:45,719
Crazy guy.  He said let's do it, and why is he crying?

340
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:48,705
He said thanks for accepting his marriage proposal.

341
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,674
He said he loves me so much.

342
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,250
He said he can't go on without me.

343
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:57,769
He said he was going crazy because
he thought I would say no.

344
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:00,021
He said all that, but...

345
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:06,366
I... really...

346
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:11,085
I know I am being cowardly,

347
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,661
gutless...

348
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:16,258
but I checked many times.

349
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:17,220
What did you check?

350
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:18,785
If it was really okay?

351
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,566
If he really wanted to get married?

352
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,002
To tell me truthfully.

353
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:26,924
What an uncouth couple!

354
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,566
Yeah, we are very unrefined.

355
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:34,383
After crying and crying, we were kicked out
by the train station manager.

356
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:39,923
I was embarrassed, and now I feel
kind of clueless, not sure what to do.

357
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,349
In the beginning...

358
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:47,300
I thought I must have been hard on Jung Joo.

359
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:53,505
So I was sad and my heart felt bad.

360
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,615
Crying for four hours... isn't that unfair?

361
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,200
It's not easy for anyone to do.

362
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:01,855
But...

363
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:04,900
Why is it that everything he does is so over the top?

364
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:07,499
Did I scare him too much?

365
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:11,255
When I saw you walk in all senseless,
I thought you were rejected.

366
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,400
It doesn't feel right.

367
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,000
What if he dumps me?

368
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:18,132
I can't live without him...

369
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:19,637
Hey, hey, quit it.

370
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,678
He must've been sad that you didn't
give him an answer for such a long time,

371
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,086
and probably all of those
feelings exploded yesterday.

372
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,430
That can happen.

373
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,104
Why are you overreacting?

374
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,797
He even bought you all the flowers you like.

375
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,458
Those...

376
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,831
I bought them.

377
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,765
I bought them on the way
home because I didn't feel right.

378
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,397
Hey, quit that marriage.

379
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:53,951
What are you lacking that you have to accept a
marriage proposal where you didn't even receive flowers?

380
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:55,545
Without even a ring?

381
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:58,574
What are his standards?

382
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,573
He's not a wild boar, is he going 
to just forward everything?

383
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:03,854
And then why does he cry?

384
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:04,855
Hey.

385
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:05,640
You.

386
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,449
You are pretty okay.

387
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:12,625
Someone may think you are really precious,

388
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,876
and will be honored to be selected by you.

389
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,569
Who is he who has nothing?

390
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:25,659
What are you looking at?

391
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:28,221
You idiot, really...

392
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,959
Let's just eat.

393
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:34,920
What do you keep looking at?

394
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,126
Hey.

395
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,142
By any chance...

396
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:39,333
What?

397
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:42,053
Are those glasses... aren't they mine?

398
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,165
Huh?

399
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:49,293
Oh my. I think we switched glasses.

400
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,975
We must also have the same prescription.

401
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,532
Wow, it looks just like mine.

402
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:56,618
Design is similar too.

403
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:00,747
Our taste are similar, so it could happen.

404
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:01,927
Yeah.

405
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:03,582
It is 30 years.

406
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:08,968
As we have been living together
don't you think it is becoming worse?

407
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:13,566
I need to leave this house soon or something.

408
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:15,733
I might become addicted.

409
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,712
What addiction?

410
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,083
Relationship Addiction.

411
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:37,562
Honestly, don't you kind of confuse it?

412
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:38,666
What?

413
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,957
Our relationship.

414
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:42,145
You too?

415
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,363
The line we drew as friends... what can I say...

416
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:48,304
It's the last line of boundary.

417
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:52,411
It seems that is broken down right?

418
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:56,380
Sometimes you get weird feelings too right?

419
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:58,593
And our conversation crosses over that boundary,

420
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,034
Yes, even though it's not serious.

421
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,811
There is no reason for it to be serious.

422
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:04,513
If it becomes serious, it would be funny.

423
00:24:04,648 --> 00:24:06,313
You were feeling it also.

424
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:07,696
You too?

425
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:10,190
I feel much better.

426
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:13,642
Since we talked about it, it is nothing.
I was worrying by myself for no reason.

427
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:17,214
After living together in one space... I guess...

428
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:21,442
Anyways, when we finish this awkward living situation,
we'll go back to the way things were.

429
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:22,855
So let's not be sensitive.

430
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,422
But looking at how Jung Joo and
Ji Sun are concerned about the matter,

431
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:28,136
I don't think it is our overreaction.

432
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,517
Even our spectacles are the same,
and they might be uneasy over that.

433
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,934
I guess so.

434
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:36,037
In your eyes, I appeared as a man too...

435
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:39,515
We are friends, but being closer than family is...

436
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,107
That is not it, is it?

437
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:43,538
Huh?

438
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:46,982
The door is open.

439
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:49,165
I am here.

440
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:50,370
Jung Joo.

441
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,136
Give me some food, wifey.

442
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:55,152
What?

443
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:57,486
I want to call you this sometimes.

444
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,679
You worried a lot, right?

445
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:04,314
You were sad.

446
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,410
Just look at your face...

447
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:08,135
Yesterday...

448
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:12,149
Think of it as me becoming an adult.

449
00:25:13,003 --> 00:25:19,668
Noona, you said if I wanted to get married,
there would be a lot of things I had to give up.

450
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,281
And still would it be okay? If I would not regret it?

451
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:28,440
After giving it all up, I feel really good.

452
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,706
From now on, you are my everything.

453
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:35,909
Come here.

454
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,119
I love you.

455
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,140
What a pleasant view so early in the morning.

456
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:09,281
Oh, yes.

457
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,480
He already said he would give up.

458
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:19,533
Could you give him just a little more time?

459
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:23,428
Yes, of course.

460
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,007
I understand.

461
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:29,486
Yes. Yes.

462
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,871
First off, let's get permission from your mom.

463
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,709
She already knows we are dating.

464
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:45,084
But still...

465
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,807
Your parents will probably be really shocked also.

466
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:51,622
I will go and tell my mom and dad by myself.

467
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:53,842
And then you can go with me.

468
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:56,823
Don't worry.

469
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:58,995
I can convince them.

470
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,375
I will make sure you don't get hurt, noona.

471
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,837
You're all grown up and you still call him dad?

472
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:09,193
Ah, I should fix that also.

473
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:10,720
Father.

474
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,446
Wife.

475
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:15,787
Aigoo. Don't you just get the chills?

476
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:18,966
Yes, let's do that slowly.

477
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:20,336
Ah~

478
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,364
I must also change if I want to meet your parents.

479
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:25,126
Do it when I'm not here.

480
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:27,335
Before I just set everything on fire.

481
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:29,793
But Jung Joo.

482
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,029
How old are your parents?

483
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:36,722
They got married when they were 20
and I was in her stomach then.

484
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:37,869
Huh?

485
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:43,159
43 minus 30.

486
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,738
FIGHTING!

487
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:49,451
Do well.

488
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,779
You can calculate right?

489
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:06,831
Yeah, this is better.

490
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:09,619
Get married.

491
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:23,877
Unni.

492
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:27,201
It's unlike you to take a day off. Why?

493
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:30,800
You are annoyed?

494
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:33,202
Now that I took a day off should I also try dating?

495
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,469
Is it really you?

496
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:40,158
Because finally my life is about to go into its next step.

497
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:42,119
Something happened, right?

498
00:28:43,498 --> 00:28:45,336
I paid off all my debts!

499
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,351
Really?

500
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,573
Congratulations.

501
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:52,785
Congrats.

502
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:55,090
That's really good.

503
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:58,693
The bank debt, the debt I owed myself,

504
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:01,625
and the blame I had for my family is all gone.

505
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:06,887
It means from now on I can make a fresh start.

506
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,887
Congratulations.

507
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,570
Have some tea.

508
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:16,025
Thank you.

509
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:20,862
Wow, there is a day when a card game
is not on your computer screen?

510
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:23,396
Just wait and see.

511
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:25,409
Consumer Complaint Center?

512
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:26,839
What is it?

513
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:31,869
After researching, I found out this is a huge lawsuit.

514
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:41,717
This person leaked out what I used my credit card for.

515
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,766
She is dead.

516
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:52,559
Where is everyone?

517
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:55,270
They all went to see Author Shin.

518
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,739
You sure did it well.

519
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:01,956
It's going to be a hit.

520
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:03,351
It kills right?

521
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:05,710
You're getting an incentive, right?

522
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,310
What are you doing?

523
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:10,532
Getting ready to greet our guest.

524
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,596
Shin Joo Young, you're done writing.

525
00:30:14,518 --> 00:30:16,288
Oh, here.

526
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,494
You decided to get married?

527
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,846
Is it already in the papers?

528
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:24,826
Did you read the article on the San Mi team?

529
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,442
You know oppa was offered a spot on
the team when he graduated high school,

530
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:32,059
and will go to that team
automatically when he graduates.

531
00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:33,125
But why?

532
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,455
Did that team fail?

533
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:35,800
Fail? Why would they fail?

534
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,921
The problem is San Mi is doing too well.

535
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:41,202
San Mi or Jung Joo are none of your business now.

536
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,779
From now on you should not
personally contact Jung Joo either.

537
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:44,644
Understand?

538
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,834
What is it?

539
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,104
I'm so curious.

540
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:52,149
Many times Jung oppa contacted me first.

541
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:57,028
Because people around him treated him
like a crazy person for going out with you.

542
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:59,870
He had no other person to discuss those issues.

543
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:01,582
You think so, right?

544
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:07,291
As an editor, I should not interfere with your writing.

545
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,380
I waited until now, but I will no longer be patient.

546
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:12,864
Who are you to play around with adults?

547
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,331
The things you do are too dirty,

548
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,876
to be excused because you are a child.

549
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,142
It is creepy to look at you like a fanatic fan.

550
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,449
You are too overboard to label
it as just a love interest you have.

551
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:24,584
Till when are you going to stalk me and Jung Joo?

552
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:27,691
Do you really want to be
greatly embarrassed once, huh?

553
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,434
Author Shin.

554
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:34,236
How did you finish all the rewritings already?

555
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,383
This is the final copy.

556
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:36,604
I'm no longer going to make any changes.

557
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:37,904
Oh, of course.

558
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,002
I read it so many times.

559
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:39,810
It's the best.

560
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:40,732
The best!

561
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,131
Of course.

562
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,931
Nan Hee, good job also.

563
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:47,581
Yes, I did do a good job.

564
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,226
Let's go eat.

565
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:50,737
We can also talk about the advertising.

566
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:54,295
Does our Author Shin like king crabs?

567
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:55,853
Yes, I like them.

568
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,936
The baseball player that helped with the book...

569
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:01,926
Ah, he was your boyfriend, right?

570
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,067
Wow, you are so skilled.

571
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,065
Tell him to come also.

572
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,126
I'm going to pay for everything.

573
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:09,287
Boss.

574
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:15,735
Can't we just eat by ourselves?

575
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:20,197
Jung Joo is busy today.

576
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:27,508
Oh, our Author Shin likes king crabs like me.

577
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:30,940
It's really delicious there.

578
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:34,281
Unni, you were really harsh.

579
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:36,604
Though she deserved it.

580
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:38,760
Why is she showing tears?

581
00:32:38,795 --> 00:32:40,130
Making me feel bad.

582
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,496
Let's go.

583
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,036
San Mi traded for another pitcher.

584
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,981
Since they have a lot of money,
they sure are doing all kinds of things.

585
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,209
Why are they so greedy for pitchers?

586
00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:58,912
It's really hard to understand you.

587
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:01,332
Half the life of a pro player is luck.

588
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:04,068
If you knew it was going to be like this,

589
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:05,790
you should have just gone right out of
high school when they called you.

590
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:08,323
Of course because of you,

591
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:11,490
I was able to raise some scores... but...

592
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:12,764
Hey, hey, hey...

593
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:16,112
Coach, I will mix it deliciously for you.

594
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:19,589
What do you have to say that you're acting so strange?

595
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,419
It's going to be delicious.

596
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,816
Have you seen the edited script, Nan Hee?

597
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,464
After the author looks at it,

598
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:30,637
we just have to hand it over to the printing press.

599
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:31,601
What about advertising?

600
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:33,261
We are in the middle of planning.

601
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,601
Interview?

602
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:36,886
Well, you do well.

603
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:38,756
No pressure right?

604
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:40,568
It doesn't matter.

605
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,664
It's my book, so I will do it well.

606
00:34:09,952 --> 00:34:11,152
Oh, so full.

607
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,129
I ate well, aunt.

608
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,362
You go ahead, I need to go to the restroom first.

609
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:17,855
Then I will go ahead.

610
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:18,886
Yes.

611
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,527
Let's go.

612
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:24,261
Author Shin.

613
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,261
Can we talk?

614
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:30,073
Do you want to go drink tea?

615
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,765
Say it here.

616
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:33,639
Okay.

617
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,083
What I said was a bit harsh.

618
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:42,844
I will apologize.

619
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,571
It wasn't because I don't know your heart...

620
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:45,607
That's okay.

621
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,633
Okay.

622
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:52,536
That's it right?

623
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:55,141
Yes.

624
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,146
Joo Young.

625
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:00,994
Because you also worry for Jung Joo,

626
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,073
I'm going to ask you a favor.

627
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,903
Your book,

628
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:07,800
I wish Jung Joo wouldn't see it.

629
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:11,851
There were a lot of things that happened,

630
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,278
but after Jung Joo failed his test,
it was really hard for him.

631
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,600
If he sees your book,

632
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:19,242
he will probably feel very upset.

633
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:20,899
You understand right?

634
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,919
His life long dream...

635
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:27,852
You laid out so well in your book like a fantasy.

636
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,859
Let me just say one thing also.

637
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:36,808
Ms. Hong.

638
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,816
This marriage,

639
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:41,899
you will regret with all your heart.

640
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:50,217
That girl is now out right cursing us.

641
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:52,156
I'm crazy.

642
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:55,354
After being attacked by her that much,
I mixed words with her again.

643
00:35:57,471 --> 00:35:58,823
Just fall straight

644
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,869
Become three years younger.

645
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:11,762
No, two years.

646
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,138
If not at least by one year.

647
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,863
There's been no such precedence.

648
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:23,261
Do you think this is child's play?

649
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:24,952
College baseball is also an official league.

650
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,333
But still, you let go of players that are
going out to play internationally.

651
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,586
The season is almost ending,

652
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,009
and I will finish off this season well.

653
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:35,870
You crazy.

654
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:38,378
If you go to San Mi without finishing school,
do you think they will welcome you?

655
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:39,771
I know they won't.

656
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:41,946
But still, I must go against it,

657
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:45,333
but before that I need your approval.

658
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,358
What's up with you lately?

659
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:50,425
Wake up.

660
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,397
Can't you tell what's up after reading the article?

661
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:54,841
The situation is twisted seriously.

662
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:58,162
The league you want to join is filled with pitchers.

663
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:01,036
You dumped San Mi to try out for the Major League
and now they're swamped with pitchers.

664
00:37:01,492 --> 00:37:03,152
So many pitchers that it's a problem.
Do you think they still need you?

665
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,414
I know.

666
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:06,455
Do you know what the best thing you can do is?

667
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:08,350
This year and next year win in the college leagues.

668
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:11,500
And throw so well that
the scouts can have an eye on you.

669
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:13,100
Then try to get into one of the spots.

670
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,884
That is the best you can do for right now!

671
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,689
Right now is the most important
time in your baseball career.

672
00:37:21,314 --> 00:37:22,097
You.

673
00:37:22,132 --> 00:37:23,997
Why didn't you go to America?

674
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:25,680
Looking at the San Mi situation now,

675
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,645
you will probably be an alternate after graduation.

676
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,967
You should have just gambled.

677
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:32,437
I want to make money.

678
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:34,322
It's okay if I am an alternate.

679
00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:35,147
If I try hard...

680
00:37:35,182 --> 00:37:37,703
Rubbish, rubbish...
Talking as if it is a game.

681
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:39,143
Do you not know what kind of life
an alternate player leads?

682
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:42,184
That is not a system where you can
move up because you work hard.

683
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:45,104
Exactly why are you doing this?

684
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,217
Is your family situation that hard?

685
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,821
I want to get married.

686
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,096
You little.

687
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,873
Before you get settled just date.

688
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:01,122
I'm so nervous I can't.

689
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:02,854
And it's hard to concentrate on baseball.

690
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:03,783
You are 22!

691
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:04,608
Why are you in such a hurry?

692
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:05,836
Unless you have a kid...

693
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:08,871
Do you have a kid on the way?

694
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:14,276
Then... the girl is old, right?

695
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:18,189
We have another crazy guy to go, go.

696
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:22,188
No.

697
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:24,411
San Mi will not try to take you immediately,

698
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:26,042
and I also won't let you go.

699
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:29,520
If you try to mess up the league system,
only then you'll end up as an idiot.

700
00:38:31,195 --> 00:38:33,816
Today I'm going to close my eyes
and pretend this never happened.

701
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:35,879
If you get blacklisted, you're out of the baseball game for sure.

702
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,520
You cannot even stay in this sport.

703
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:40,005
Coach.

704
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,457
Jun Joo.

705
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:44,820
If an athlete meets the wrong woman,

706
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,492
his life is over.

707
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:52,436
Every baseball you'll ever throw in your career,
adds to your reputation.

708
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,594
If you loosen up.

709
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:57,581
It's not stop but E-N-D

710
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:58,648
The end.

711
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:04,719
Dinner appointment is okay, right?

712
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:06,642
Yes, I will.

713
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:09,423
I will take you to a nice place.

714
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:13,154
I'm going to go.

715
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:14,360
Why there?

716
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:16,583
Sunbae has been moved to 
the marketing department there.

717
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:18,099
They're having trouble in the
commercial department nowadays.

718
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:19,373
Oh~

719
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:20,485
Are you going to get them?

720
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:22,934
I'm just laying some ground work first.

721
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,397
I'll be back.

722
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:44,521
Try it.

723
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:46,887
You made all this?

724
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:50,877
It's delicious.

725
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:53,760
I've always wanted to do this once up here.

726
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:54,504
Why?

727
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:57,593
Because I came up here a lot when I was an intern.

728
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,957
Every time I was sad.

729
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:03,623
That's when I found this.

730
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,567
It was hard with the other interns.

731
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,673
And because I couldn't get along with the other interns...

732
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,536
I was embarrassed in front
of the other company workers.

733
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:12,424
And my work here felt strange.

734
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:16,512
And so, from then on, I started looking
for the owner of this pin.

735
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:18,542
What are you going to do when you find the owner?

736
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:21,372
I was going to find it and return it
and maybe have a meal with the owner.

737
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:23,253
It's a chance to talk to that person.

738
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:27,657
And since this person comes here a lot,
seems like this person has a lot of sorrows.

739
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,639
But I was not able to find the couple
cuff links that went with this.

740
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:34,936
And so...

741
00:40:35,071 --> 00:40:38,215
With this smart head, I started solving this mystery.

742
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,212
Hmm~

743
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:41,524
Looking at the situation.

744
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:46,059
Find a picture here that wasn't here three months ago.

745
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,900
I found it.

746
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:52,741
See, it is yours right?

747
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:55,486
It is yours, right oppa?

748
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,185
I will return it to you.

749
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,527
Who said this was mine?

750
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,046
No..?

751
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,967
What is the picture you see that is different?

752
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:05,060
The billboard.

753
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:08,056
Yoon Sung Ah used to be right up there.

754
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:10,362
Why do you pretend not to know?

755
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:11,551
No.

756
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:14,746
Me.

757
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,815
Was that only three months ago?

758
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,470
It seems like three years has passed.

759
00:41:22,795 --> 00:41:24,973
Oppa, you have changed?

760
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:27,494
How?

761
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,979
You are next to me.

762
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:33,953
Even though I had a dinner appointment,

763
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:36,774
I'm eating the food you have packed me.

764
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:38,629
Even though, I'm going to be late
for a important meeting,

765
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:39,967
I'm spending time with you.

766
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,208
The things I did in the past,

767
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:46,612
the things I thought I couldn't do again,

768
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,848
I'm doing it now.

769
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,282
You have a meeting?

770
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:51,856
Is it a dinner appointment?

771
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,578
I plan on being late.

772
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,985
Go quickly.

773
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:57,758
Why?

774
00:41:57,793 --> 00:41:59,028
It's wasteful, let's eat and go.

775
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:01,133
You being like this makes me sad.

776
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:04,749
If you have an appointment or a meeting,
you should tell me you have them.

777
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:06,826
I feel like I'm being patronized here.

778
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:08,895
Until now, you still can't get along with me comfortably?

779
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,500
Hey, look at you.

780
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:13,465
Because I was moved by your preparations that I...

781
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,713
But why am I also feeling thankful to you
for considering my feelings first...

782
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:29,246
Today, we're like a couple who's just starting to date. Right?

783
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:31,192
Yes, I can feel it.

784
00:42:31,931 --> 00:42:33,775
As a way to go up a level,

785
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,423
I have a request.

786
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:36,423
What is it?

787
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,438
When we part,

788
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:41,344
don't show me your backside.

789
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,860
Also look at my backside.

790
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,757
Go, I will watch.

791
00:42:46,392 --> 00:42:47,432
Today I will pass.

792
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,469
Go quickly.

793
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:50,253
Okay.

794
00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:52,866
Bye.

795
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,668
<i>Congratulations!</i>

796
00:43:37,803 --> 00:43:39,728
You are finally getting married!

797
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:41,614
We still have a long way to go.

798
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:43,311
Oppa.

799
00:43:43,903 --> 00:43:45,570
I wonder if my clothes will fit.

800
00:43:45,605 --> 00:43:48,223
Right, because he has such an athletic body...

801
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,161
I meant length.

802
00:43:50,196 --> 00:43:51,593
I guess length will also be a problem.

803
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:52,746
Let me see.

804
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,891
Since you are going to meet the parents,

805
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:57,144
you have to look trustworthy.

806
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,149
Hmm~

807
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:02,418
I think this will be good also.

808
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:13,781
How is it?

809
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:14,943
Is it good?

810
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:15,765
Wow.

811
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,183
You look good.

812
00:44:17,218 --> 00:44:18,654
You're so handsome.

813
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,972
Better than Hyung Tae.

814
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:22,649
I'm shocked.

815
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:24,706
He is better looking than you, oppa.

816
00:44:25,321 --> 00:44:27,076
Wow, he looks good.

817
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,513
Look it's cool right?

818
00:44:32,257 --> 00:44:33,640
Yes, it's cool.

819
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:35,592
It's mine, give it.

820
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:38,790
It smells.

821
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:40,311
I guess I have to dry clean it to wear it.

822
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:42,907
I will teach you, a slider.

823
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,704
Oh my, when.

824
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:52,398
When he rented this house to you,
and left on vacation.

825
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:55,772
So he went to Spain to do that?

826
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:58,216
He said he told her to come back any time,

827
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:00,787
that he will always be waiting for her.

828
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:02,059
To Yoon Sung Ah.

829
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:10,972
But will you be okay?

830
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:14,046
We started dating because I begged him.

831
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:18,496
If she comes back and he still doesn't like me,

832
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:20,430
I said I would let him go.

833
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,939
If Hyung Tae had that in his heart,

834
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:27,663
he wouldn't have started with you.

835
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:30,651
I'm so nervous because he is so kind.

836
00:45:31,331 --> 00:45:34,863
He seems like a person making up
for something, he is too kind.

837
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,159
The fun of starting a romance is just that.

838
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:41,573
Don't be nervous.

839
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,968
Sung Ah will not return.

840
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:49,456
She doesn't have the right to return to Hyung Tae.

841
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,658
And Sung Ah knows that the best.

842
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:56,327
What does that mean?

843
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:58,813
It means you can relax.

844
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:07,596
Idiot.

845
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:10,474
While dating why would he bring up a past lover.

846
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:12,280
He doesn't have the basics.

847
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:22,265
Idiot.

848
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:23,725
What?

849
00:46:24,642 --> 00:46:26,957
Why did you tell Ji Sun about Sung Ah?

850
00:46:28,746 --> 00:46:29,510
Hey.

851
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:32,414
I had a very surprising experience today.

852
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:33,347
What?

853
00:46:34,604 --> 00:46:38,454
I had no reaction at the name Yoon Sung Ah.

854
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:39,747
Bravo!

855
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:40,781
Bravo!

856
00:46:42,985 --> 00:46:46,223
I was worried on how I would leave you and get married,

857
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:48,663
but now I'm bit reassured.

858
00:46:48,998 --> 00:46:51,095
It's a bit too early to be reassured.

859
00:46:52,094 --> 00:46:54,871
The thing I tried so hard to do,

860
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,256
Ji Sun was able to do in one time.

861
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:58,913
What?

862
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,556
Making you forget her.

863
00:47:05,135 --> 00:47:06,059
Oh yeah,

864
00:47:06,294 --> 00:47:08,131
you got ahjussi's phone call right?

865
00:47:08,677 --> 00:47:09,908
Ah, the fishing trip.

866
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:12,385
Us going on the trip together is a secret from Ji Sun.

867
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,748
Why are you hiding that?

868
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:15,320
She said she wanted to go also,

869
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:17,949
but we're going to commemorate your father's death.

870
00:47:17,984 --> 00:47:18,905
So she can't come.

871
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,929
You should have asked her to understand.

872
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:23,382
It's a yearly trip we have always gone with your father.

873
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:25,594
We have done it for 20 years.

874
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:26,857
Don't argue.

875
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:29,956
I lost the right timing to tell her.

876
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:32,890
If you keep secrets from her...

877
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:35,513
I don't even know where the secret starts...

878
00:47:37,495 --> 00:47:39,393
Truth and misconception.

879
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:42,065
Real and Imagination.

880
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:43,900
What are you saying.

881
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:46,288
And addiction.

882
00:47:48,547 --> 00:47:50,141
Pick the word you like.

883
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:52,953
Misconception.

884
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:56,689
Okay.

885
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:00,501
Please have a sit.

886
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:03,752
Where do you think you're sitting?

887
00:48:03,787 --> 00:48:04,801
Mom.

888
00:48:05,948 --> 00:48:07,294
It's okay if I stand.

889
00:48:08,124 --> 00:48:10,407
I have nothing to say so
I don't care if you stand there or not.

890
00:48:10,442 --> 00:48:11,064
Mom.

891
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,622
Don't be like that.

892
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:14,205
Mother.

893
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:16,695
Who are you calling mother?

894
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:20,412
Mother.

895
00:48:21,217 --> 00:48:23,315
I have something to say today.

896
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,077
Aigoo... really...

897
00:48:25,412 --> 00:48:26,350
Why are you doing this?

898
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:27,481
Unni, sit.

899
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:28,257
Sit down please.

900
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:30,358
Sit, sit, sit.

901
00:48:39,444 --> 00:48:42,082
I know I don't have the right.

902
00:48:42,982 --> 00:48:44,883
I don't have anything to offer now,

903
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:48,857
but I will work my hardest to make noona happy.

904
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:51,668
You who don't have anything right now?

905
00:48:51,903 --> 00:48:54,450
So why did you come to see me?

906
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:54,929
Mom...

907
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,242
You shut your mouth.

908
00:48:57,306 --> 00:48:59,632
Okay, fine.

909
00:49:00,267 --> 00:49:02,057
What did your parents say?

910
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:03,323
Do they like my daughter?

911
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,766
They were not shocked?

912
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:06,669
I haven't told them yet.

913
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:09,634
Because you are first, mother.

914
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,758
I will take care of my parents.

915
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:15,376
So noona will be okay.
Don't worry.

916
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,178
Oh really...

917
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:18,942
There is nothing more to listen to.

918
00:49:19,077 --> 00:49:20,043
Mother.

919
00:49:20,378 --> 00:49:21,908
Mother, please I beg of you.

920
00:49:25,102 --> 00:49:27,535
It was a hard decision to make for both noona and me.

921
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:29,269
And we thought over it a long time.

922
00:49:30,158 --> 00:49:34,166
Even if you object, please allow me
to do everything I can.

923
00:49:34,733 --> 00:49:36,806
You probably cannot make money right away.

924
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,273
What do your parents do?

925
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:41,993
Can they financially help you?

926
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:45,496
My father is a elementary baseball team coach.

927
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:48,735
And my mother owns a small gift shop.

928
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,651
They will probably help us a little,

929
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:55,496
but they worked hard to make me a baseball player.

930
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,706
I want to do this marriage by my strength.

931
00:49:59,346 --> 00:50:00,305
How?

932
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,274
By what?

933
00:50:01,309 --> 00:50:04,739
I'm working hard, so by next year I can make money.

934
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:06,652
How can a student make money?

935
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:08,612
Are you going to work part time at a grocery store?

936
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:12,445
I am going to make money by throwing balls.

937
00:50:13,346 --> 00:50:14,452
I still...

938
00:50:15,004 --> 00:50:17,750
I still cannot tell you for sure,

939
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:20,654
but I will not lean on noona.

940
00:50:20,863 --> 00:50:22,754
This I promise you.

941
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:28,713
Look here, I really have nothing more to hear.

942
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:32,657
I can understand that you are
a really nice and good person,

943
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:36,569
but you cannot live this world
with just trying and promises.

944
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:41,030
Even now your will is ahead but you are not giving me
anything that I can put my trust in.

945
00:50:42,304 --> 00:50:45,553
Today... I had a lot of things to tell you.

946
00:50:46,074 --> 00:50:48,083
Only hollow words, no more.

947
00:50:48,118 --> 00:50:49,898
Please let's stop.

948
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:52,311
Mom.

949
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:53,624
You keep still.

950
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:03,858
Nan Hee, this is an account I made in your name.

951
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,797
I have tried pleading with you,

952
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:12,700
and threatened you too, but in the end you have
brought this student in front of me.

953
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,939
I cannot shave the head of a
30 year old and make you stay home.

954
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,275
I cannot lock you in a room with a lock.

955
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:22,907
You are not the type to listen to me.

956
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:24,816
You... don't come here either.

957
00:51:25,677 --> 00:51:27,586
You cannot break up with that student.

958
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:30,023
And I can not give my consent.

959
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:35,276
Anyways, you went out to try living on your own.

960
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:36,538
Let's cut our ties.

961
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:38,724
Mother, please don't.

962
00:51:39,355 --> 00:51:41,447
We will not get married until you approve.

963
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,209
Then will you break up?

964
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:47,157
You both, tell me your answer right now.

965
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:51,269
And you telling me to approve that answer
no matter what, is a threat right?

966
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:57,531
Receive this.

967
00:51:58,025 --> 00:51:59,641
And let me go.

968
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:02,432
Like you have things you want to do.

969
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:05,741
I also had hopes for my children.

970
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:13,418
Noona?

971
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:14,637
Huh?

972
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:21,104
In this world, there aren't a lot of things I can do.

973
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:23,528
Me too.

974
00:52:25,405 --> 00:52:27,326
I feel really ashamed in front of you.

975
00:52:28,526 --> 00:52:33,197
I told you that I would be able to show
her that I'm a responsible person.

976
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:41,072
But still,

977
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:42,897
you can't get tired already.

978
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:05,645
You came?

979
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,770
Thanks. I will return it after dry cleaning it.

980
00:53:08,805 --> 00:53:11,616
It's okay. You got scolded a lot, right?

981
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:14,519
Do you want me to help?

982
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:15,871
Try to help convince ahjumma?

983
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:17,687
Jun Joo said he will do it.

984
00:53:18,122 --> 00:53:20,872
He said he will go everyday until he gets approval.

985
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:24,479
Hey look how it is soaked in sweat.

986
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:27,061
He must have been really nervous.

987
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,269
Unni, just go home.

988
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,416
Open the door.

989
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:47,729
Since before mom also... come later.

990
00:53:47,764 --> 00:53:50,851
I know that's why I came. Please open.

991
00:53:56,396 --> 00:53:57,237
Okay.

992
00:53:57,672 --> 00:53:59,165
This is good.

993
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,112
I can just say whatever I want and then leave.

994
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:08,400
The shirt Jung Joo wore was soaked with sweat.

995
00:54:10,154 --> 00:54:12,893
He must have been really nervous in front of you, mom.

996
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:16,204
That Jung Joo you might not have believed in.

997
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:21,273
But I'm thankful for Jung Joo trying so hard.

998
00:54:22,112 --> 00:54:23,948
Unsure future.

999
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:30,606
Yeah I might just end up suffering
a lot like you said mom,  but...

1000
00:54:31,658 --> 00:54:34,323
But that does not matter at all to me, mom.

1001
00:54:35,332 --> 00:54:37,678
Because I love Jung Joo so much...

1002
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:45,734
I want to live this unsure life with Jung Joo.

1003
00:54:48,507 --> 00:54:50,635
Jung Joo pitches...

1004
00:54:51,544 --> 00:54:54,082
Soars when I cheer for him.

1005
00:54:54,936 --> 00:54:57,621
Do you know how happy I am watching that?

1006
00:54:58,386 --> 00:55:00,793
Do you know how much he loves me?

1007
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:06,298
Do you know how much he cares for me
who has nothing to really show?

1008
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:16,543
It's the first time I found out that being 
loved by someone it's such a blessing.

1009
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:20,568
I don't think I will have this again.

1010
00:55:20,803 --> 00:55:27,033
Receiving love or my heart shaking like this.

1011
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:29,806
I think this will be the last time.

1012
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:34,770
And that is why I can't... I can't fold it.

1013
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:42,063
Mom.

1014
00:55:43,129 --> 00:55:45,372
I'm really sorry to you.

1015
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:50,415
Because I haven't lived up to 
anything you had hoped for me.

1016
00:55:50,516 --> 00:55:51,867
I am truly sorry.

1017
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:59,193
But to me, I don't need
the money you gave me right now,

1018
00:55:59,228 --> 00:56:00,907
but I need you.

1019
00:56:02,978 --> 00:56:05,986
When we say that we will not
get married without your consent,

1020
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:10,561
that is not a threat but it's
because I need you right now.

1021
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,827
Whether I live well or not.

1022
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:19,099
I need a mom besides me who will cheer me.

1023
00:56:21,756 --> 00:56:24,704
If it turns out well, that will be the best.

1024
00:56:25,288 --> 00:56:26,681
But if it turns out bad,

1025
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:31,904
If not, I need a mom beside me who will scold me for not listening to her.

1026
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:34,908
Huh? Mom?

1027
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:37,714
Mom?

1028
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:37,829
He left this space for a Cy Young Award.

1029
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:41,795
<i>Cy Young Award: an American award that
commemorates the great pitcher, Cy Young,</i>

1030
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:47,074
<i>who pitched for 22 years in the major leagues by
giving the award to the best pitcher that year.</i>

1031
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:53,419
<i>Noona!</i>

1032
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:54,705
What? What?

1033
00:57:55,032 --> 00:57:56,422
That's a good thing?

1034
00:57:56,657 --> 00:57:57,779
Of course.

1035
00:57:58,014 --> 00:58:00,130
Now we must also tell your mom
that I will be able to make money.

1036
00:58:00,165 --> 00:58:02,144
You're an alternate player.

1037
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:06,826
If you graduated, weren't you
supposed to go as the first pitcher?

1038
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:10,721
I have to go to San Mi,
but even now they have too many pitchers.

1039
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:13,482
The situation will not change must next year.

1040
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:18,360
Instead, it is better to start playing to catch
my chance at moving up to first and making money.

1041
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,733
But still...

1042
00:58:19,968 --> 00:58:21,562
Must you quit school?

1043
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:23,818
I came to school to play baseball.

1044
00:58:24,053 --> 00:58:26,127
Playing baseball anywhere is the best thing.

1045
00:58:27,075 --> 00:58:28,713
That is so... but...

1046
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,254
The pay will be really small.

1047
00:58:32,033 --> 00:58:34,131
Are you disappointed because I am an alternate?

1048
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,892
Are you making a wrong decision because of marriage?

1049
00:58:38,399 --> 00:58:40,438
That worries me.

1050
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:43,510
I can make ends meet until you graduate.

1051
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,169
Thanks to marriage I'm making a good decision.

1052
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:48,351
You aren't skipping practice right?

1053
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:49,330
Of course.

1054
00:58:49,565 --> 00:58:52,073
No matter what, I stick to the workout schedule.

1055
00:58:52,493 --> 00:58:53,954
Good, you should.

1056
00:58:54,648 --> 00:58:55,566
Jung Joo.

1057
00:58:57,022 --> 00:59:00,943
Whatever decision you make, think of only yourself.

1058
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:02,720
Make the decision selfishly.

1059
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:05,961
That is the best for our future.

1060
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:07,450
Okay?

1061
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:10,394
Are you that nervous about me?

1062
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,133
No, it's not that.

1063
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:16,898
Eat, Jung Joo.

1064
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:23,632
Eh, ball.

1065
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:30,148
Wheew, strike.

1066
00:59:34,595 --> 00:59:37,676
It's been a long time since we have hugged like this.

1067
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:41,308
After coming back from America,
it seems like a year has passed.

1068
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:45,180
Yes, it was busy days.

1069
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:47,917
Mother has to approve us.

1070
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:52,971
If my mom is like this, what about your parents?

1071
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:54,914
Don't worry.

1072
00:59:56,102 --> 00:59:57,060
Okay.

1073
00:59:57,317 --> 00:59:58,729
Let's forget for today.

1074
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:00,795
Let's just love each other wholly.

1075
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:08,385
This picture... I look at it a lot.

1076
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,229
My mom calls it the Hall of Fame.

1077
01:00:12,513 --> 01:00:14,866
I will also help fill it now.

1078
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:18,597
Jung Joo, but why did you put nothing here?

1079
01:00:18,732 --> 01:00:20,237
Did it used to hold something?

1080
01:00:20,272 --> 01:00:22,960
No, it's a place for the Cy Young Award.

1081
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:24,881
Oh.

1082
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:29,437
Ah, I wanted to give it to you
at the train station but I forgot.

1083
01:00:30,015 --> 01:00:30,848
Hmm?

1084
01:00:32,188 --> 01:00:34,009
It's the hat I wore while doing the test.

1085
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:38,500
The object that witnesses how hard I've worked.

1086
01:00:39,142 --> 01:00:40,872
I thought of buying a ring,

1087
01:00:41,444 --> 01:00:43,458
but this has more meaning to me.

1088
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:45,340
Thank you.

1089
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,579
Too bad.

1090
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,857
If I had given it to you then,
it would have been really romantic.

1091
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,010
It really is the best present.

1092
01:00:55,897 --> 01:00:59,701
Noona, don't you feel unfair
being caught by a guy like me?

1093
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:01,587
How can you say something like that?

1094
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:03,371
You are the man I chose.

1095
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:06,349
Lately I feel like I'm going through puberty.

1096
01:01:07,327 --> 01:01:11,962
Everyday thinking, am I only this much of a guy?

1097
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,838
But still noona, even though I also
feel bad because I can't do much,

1098
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:21,592
but I will definitely make it up to you for coming to me.

1099
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:25,711
I will live hard as I tried hard when I wore that hat.

1100
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:29,038
Ah,

1101
01:01:30,407 --> 01:01:32,911
I cannot think of anything better...

1102
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:35,691
I just...

1103
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,268
Wait a moment there is more.

1104
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:46,449
This is the signed ball I practiced
with in elementary school.

1105
01:01:47,632 --> 01:01:50,225
It seems I tried to copy Kim Joo Ahn player's signature.

1106
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,050
Who's that?

1107
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,283
Noona, you know a lot of baseball
players because of me right?

1108
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:56,881
Hmm.

1109
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,903
Yes, I have gotten to know them because of you.

1110
01:02:00,038 --> 01:02:02,665
This player was the best 10 years ago.

1111
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,966
He started as a alternate player,

1112
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:07,518
but he led his team to the
championships and even got an M.V.P.

1113
01:02:07,896 --> 01:02:09,693
He even got offers from the major league.

1114
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,130
He was my idol.

1115
01:02:12,265 --> 01:02:14,484
But how come I don't know.

1116
01:02:14,919 --> 01:02:16,727
After he got hurt, he had a surgery, and
because of that, he wasn't able to come back.

1117
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:20,563
He has become a player no one knows about.

1118
01:02:21,129 --> 01:02:27,276
But he, who went to the top and fell
all the way to the bottom, is only 30 years old.

1119
01:02:28,972 --> 01:02:31,223
I'm in a very vicious world, noona.

1120
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:37,494
And so I cannot guarantee what will happen to me.

1121
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,007
I also cannot promise anything to your mother.

1122
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:46,926
But still noona, if you are next to me I will try my best.

1123
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:48,889
That I will promise.

1124
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:50,840
Jung Joo.

1125
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:56,705
I am so happy.

1126
01:02:58,137 --> 01:03:00,700
I am so happy that you are my man.

1127
01:03:02,023 --> 01:03:05,266
Let's love for a long time.

1128
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:06,789
Hmm.

1129
01:03:06,426 --> 01:03:06,789
<i>We spent our days without knowing.</i>

1130
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,649
<i>We spent our days without knowing.</i>

1131
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:14,076
<i>Like hands on a clock.</i>

1132
01:03:14,311 --> 01:03:17,037
<i>Can you see my tears?</i>

1133
01:03:17,372 --> 01:03:20,380
<i>Can you hear my voice?</i>

1134
01:03:20,815 --> 01:03:28,700
<i>Come hold me who is crying.</i>

1135
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:31,471
<i>Our breathing... our lips...</i>

1136
01:03:33,006 --> 01:03:34,178
<i>It was connected.</i>

1137
01:03:34,957 --> 01:03:36,638
<i>We were able to ride a rhythm.</i>

1138
01:03:44,965 --> 01:03:48,583
<i>It is the first time I'm playing catch ball with this man.</i>

1139
01:04:21,655 --> 01:04:22,574
Jung Joo!

1140
01:04:23,453 --> 01:04:24,342
Dad!

Let's break up now, Jung Joo.

1146
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:01,651
<i>I was so thankful for your love,</i>

1147
01:05:02,686 --> 01:05:05,560
<i>and because I received so much of it.</i>

1148
01:05:06,057 --> 01:05:11,293
<i>I think I can live the rest of my days from that strength.</i>

1149
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:19,111
Even if you are 40 and there
is no one next to you, marry me.
