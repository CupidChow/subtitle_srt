<i>Park Chul Soon.</i>

00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:11,910
<i>From April to September 1982. In 161 days, he went on the field 30 times.</i>

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:19,627
<i>24 wins 4 loses 7 draws later, he became the No. 1 baseball player with a score of 1.84.</i>

5
00:00:19,627 --> 00:00:27,096
<i>Born on May 1960, striker Kim Yong Soo had 2 wins in 3 consecutive years.</i>

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,294
<i>Winning 7 times for Hae Tae*, Sun Dong Ryul pitcher, (*name of baseball league)</i>

7
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:38,619
<i>Because of this, Koreaís baseball could then become a rich and exciting sport item.</i>

4th Inning

9
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,301
His girlfriend?

10
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,149
Looks like it.

11
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,472
Asa!

12
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:07,161
Why are you so happy?

13
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,041
When I think of that time, I keep feeling uneasy, so I...

14
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,089
Just let them get married.

15
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,884
Is she very pretty?

16
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,959
Is it?

17
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,758
I think that Noona is prettier.

18
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,142
Everyone is looking. Jung Joo.

19
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:00,956
Donít move.

20
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,689
Letís go watch a movie too?

21
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,755
I want to have a scroll.

22
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:07,829
Want to go to Jong Dou?

23
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:08,863
You must be tired.

24
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,302
Not one bit.

25
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,318
Letís go.

26
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,125
Back so quick?

27
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:28,423
Didnít you say you were going to watch a movie?

28
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,640
Why are you back so fast?

29
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,538
When we were taking the bus, Jung Joo fell asleep.

30
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:32,889
I let him go back home.

31
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,641
Whatís up?

32
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:37,831
Didnít you say that the ink has finished? So I bought some.

33
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,690
Why would someone on a date buy that?

34
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,984
You should pay more attention to her.

35
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:44,594
If not you will get dumped.

36
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,032
What date?

37
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,092
Want to let you have some time alone. So I backed out.

38
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:50,257
Not dating?

39
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,421
Didnít you not come back the whole night?

40
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:55,111
I was working.

41
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,849
I bought Honghap*. (*sea mussels)

42
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:00,874
Do you want to eat it will beer?

43
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:03,081
I will go warm it up.

44
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,080
What?

45
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,670
I bought it too.

46
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,171
What it is?

47
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:16,064
After he graduated from high school, he was selected as a professional player.

48
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:18,468
Furthermore, itís the top team.

49
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:22,686
But then why doesnít he join the baseball team but went on to the university?

50
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:24,633
Because he wants to become a coach?

51
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:25,787
Excuses.

52
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:28,486
This can be a possibility.

53
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:30,750
There is someone who is willing to invest in the team and has interest in him.

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,624
If he has the feel he can throw a very nice ball.

55
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:36,612
The problem is that that feel doesnít come often.

56
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:38,831
There are a lot of kids like that.

57
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,422
If he thinks that he canít make it, they will join the army.

58
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,524
After that, how is he going to feed himself?

59
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,131
Tell him when he joins the baseball team, he should say thank you. Then join in, that's the way.

60
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:48,519
That is the way we think.

61
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:52,723
Wasnít it said that youth is magnificent?

62
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:55,051
Hope is rice.

63
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,977
Challenges is life.

64
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,643
Miracles are choices.

65
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:03,143
Failure are fertilizers. That sort of time of your life.

66
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,848
You think that you have lived enough?

67
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,681
You are still young.

68
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:12,599
Perhaps when I am together with Jung Joo, the differences is too great.

69
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,940
Oh, it is a little like that.

70
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,440
Thatís right.

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,268
When you put your heart there, the feeling is not that bad.

72
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:23,881
No obstructions. Enthusiasm. Strong.

73
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,619
You are writing a novel.

74
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:29,119
The sky, the land, the wind.

75
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,445
It comes towards you in an embrace.

76
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,961
All transferred to these pair of hands.

77
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,881
Mad woman.

78
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:37,351
Dragon Ball.

79
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:39,902
Is he the Monkey god?

80
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,084
That is a tragedy too.

81
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:46,772
How come he does not know Journey to the West?

82
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:50,320
He said that the Monkey god is a character from the History of the three Kingdoms.

83
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,709
History of the three Kingdoms?

84
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,586
Then is Jang Bi the tortoise grandpa?

85
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:58,821
That's just like Jjang Ga*, Jjang Ga. (*Korean Anime character)

86
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,534
Nevertheless still a friend.

87
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,702
Arenít they too cruel?

88
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,039
Ji Sun said that?

89
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,100
Yeah.

90
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,329
Thatís right.

91
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,720
When others see us staying together, they will look at us with a peculiar stare.

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,738
They did not give us the peculiar stare.

93
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,855
When a man and a woman stayed together for more than a month,

94
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:23,429
if nothing happens, it is definitely not a relationship together.

95
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:26,522
We already have a 30 years friendship.

96
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:28,114
If we wanted each other, we would already have kids much earlier.

97
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,929
I also find this a mystery.

98
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,429
Miss Hong.

99
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:35,320
How come you do not have any feelings when you see me?

100
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,490
Donít even mention about feelings, in front of you,

101
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:42,194
I donít even bother to tuck in my tummy.

102
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,374
Generally, if one can see a womanís under garments from her blouse,

103
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:48,374
normally, a guy should have some reaction.

104
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:50,393
YouÖ

105
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:51,782
Canít see anything, canít see.

106
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,483
I was only just casually saying it.

107
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,814
Not see the under garments, even if it were kissing you, I wouldnít have any feelings.

108
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,894
Thatís what I think too.

109
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,578
But itís better not to kiss.

110
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:18,375
Right.

111
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,561
How is it?

112
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,085
Well written.

113
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:39,708
I think internet novels creates a deceitful trick to make

114
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,159
others frustrated and bored, hence I donít really like it.

115
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,035
But this person has connected the story very well.

116
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:46,606
The person knows how to arouse the readerís curiosity.

117
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,988
A female student?

118
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,847
Oh, 18 years old.

119
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,459
The details are a little pitiful.

120
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,078
Do we want to take a hand in it?

121
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:53,701
Yes.

122
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:54,717
Ok.

123
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,623
I will give you the original script. Arrange a time.

124
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:57,528
Yes.

125
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:59,022
Agent Hong.

126
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:00,396
The writer is our companyís precious baby.

127
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:01,785
Do you know?

128
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,535
It can be counted so.

129
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:05,301
Written it quite well.

130
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,584
The temperament not that quite good.

131
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,005
However bad is her temperament, she is only a high schooler.

132
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,584
There is a prize right?

133
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,974
There is something nice to look at?

134
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,128
Yeah, you have a look too.

135
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,756
Today I must I must put in my best efforts.

136
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,068
Asa!

137
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,553
I must make a great one.

138
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:28,361
The information we can give are just these.

139
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,879
You need it in two weeks time right?

140
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,564
It should be so.

141
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:36,500
The exact date, I will confirm with the President tomorrow and I will let you know.

142
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,674
Department Chief is to come too.

143
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,879
But he caught a cold and has to apply for medical leave.

144
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,315
Not because he has other advertisement, that is why he is too busy right?

145
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,863
How can it be?

146
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:47,110
You are our regular customer.

147
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,300
Make a good preparation.

148
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Yes.

149
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,831
Please look forward to it.

150
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,664
Itís this occasional chance meeting that gives me a pleasant surprise.

151
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:07,258
What do business do you have here?

152
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:09,244
You are doing this too?

153
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,369
You tooÖ

154
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:12,870
The first assignment when I enter the working world.

155
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,980
Then we are competitors.

156
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,464
Letís look for a place to eat lunch.

157
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,336
You havenít eaten have you?

158
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,338
Yes.

159
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:20,977
Yeah, letís go.

160
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:24,605
Heard that you will be going into the planning sector tomorrow?

161
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,837
Yup. Planning department for Dae Woon and San.

162
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,596
All the while signing the contract with your company, this time it is to end the contract.

163
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:31,909
Yeah.

164
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,175
This goes to say that your companyís ideas arenít that good.

165
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:36,671
Rascal. You are trying to provoke it.

166
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,421
Donít look down on us.

167
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,435
We have done it a few times, hence we understand it well.

168
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:43,968
Tomorrow I will be going to observe the test.

169
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:47,607
The organizer even open this up to others?

170
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,851
Did you buy them out?

171
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,670
What is there to be nervous about?

172
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,251
After researching on all seniors, hence I asked them to do it.

173
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,984
Breaking the rules.

174
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:57,920
Then letís go together?

175
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,047
What ulterior motives do you have?

176
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,501
Do you have some kind of connection?

177
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,126
Myself.

178
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,702
You have been too influenced by America my friend.

179
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:12,141
In Korea, compared to oneís own capability and strength, relationships are more important.

180
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:15,673
Having entered the society much earlier than me, you havenít learnt how to

181
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:19,063
break the rules, what have you been doing?

182
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:22,017
You have consecutively asked so many weird questions, why is that?

183
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,486
Havenít you always lost control whenever you are nervous?

184
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,362
Only newcomers will lose control.

185
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:28,268
Pride will also make one lose control.

186
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,549
You said it.

187
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,133
My treat.

188
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:38,754
If you want to view the testing, contact me.

189
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:41,127
You will have a better feel of it rather than reading it on paper.

190
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,971
Ok, it was done like this without it the past.

191
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:50,206
Furthermore, I should let you have a better chance at it.

192
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:57,410
Showing off to me?

193
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,628
I should have said Iíll go.

194
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:04,283
Why am I always dragged together with him?

195
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:19,034
<i>Bullshit.</i>

196
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,858
<i>What sort of self-respect is that?</i>

197
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:26,752
You actually went to compete with those sitting beside you in the sauna who could stay longer.

198
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,374
Open your eyes.

199
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:30,859
Itís all flowing out.

200
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:33,593
I donít like eye drops.

201
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,499
Just hold it for awhile.

202
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:37,967
How could you have held on to this extend?

203
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:40,187
I only feel that my eyes are a little tight.

204
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,169
Who knows that my blood vessels are injured?

205
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:44,019
Just donít move.

206
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,657
I'm the one with the eye injury, so why are you getting mad at me for?!

207
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,891
What are males thinking living like that?

208
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,623
Have males harmed you that bad?

209
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,796
Itís those little kids that are lower than the males that did it.

210
00:10:56,796 --> 00:11:03,030
Male or female, itís all violated by little nuisance kids.

211
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:26,610
A girl 12 years my junior, so boastfully said that she is a writer.

212
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,938
What make up does a higher schooler need to put on?

213
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,248
She was all dressed in pink.

214
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:33,982
She thinks she is some piglet.

215
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:38,322
Your luck this year, is it one that clashes with kids?

216
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,540
I have prepared the information over a few days. You know that too.

217
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,478
I spent so much effort to help sort out the characters and the story line for her.

218
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:48,790
She just takes those as rubbish.

219
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,480
In front of you?

220
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,821
Of course!

221
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:52,400
You still let her off?

222
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,353
A classless fellow.

223
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:57,463
Using a marker, draw two lines on it.

224
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,414
You know?

225
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:00,603
Those furry pens with feathers.

226
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,039
Furthermore, itís pink in color.

227
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,539
That time, I really wanted to hit her twice.

228
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:12,636
In the end, I endured it, because of the prize.

229
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:13,635
How much is the prize?

230
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:15,134
Who cares how much it is?

231
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:20,243
Have to save up money quickly to move out of here.

232
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:32,539
Just take it slow, anyway, moving doesnít have to be in a hurry.

233
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:35,528
You think so too?

234
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:42,498
Just the thought of me moving out of this house, there is a weird feeling inside.

235
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,446
I'm Sorry.

236
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,625
How come you donít even know the order?

237
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,790
Every time you do the same thing.

238
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,013
I'm Sorry. Because I was in a hurry to get to work..

239
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:58,115
Only you have to go to work in this world?

240
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:00,592
You think I have an easy time doing this?

241
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:01,591
I'm Sorry.

242
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:03,029
This I will do it.

243
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,562
You can head up.

244
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,967
Furthermore itísÖ

245
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,592
Only know how to say sorry, sorry.

246
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:11,640
You have to prove it with your actions right?

247
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:17,187
Aunty, I will come to sort it out in awhile.

248
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:19,872
Where are you going?

249
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,435
Aunty, I am in a hurry.

250
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,309
This is too much.

251
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,044
You made it like this, where do you thing you are going?

252
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:30,688
No. 705, can you help me to call them again?

253
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:33,718
Where did this useless bum come from?

254
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:36,485
Really painful.

255
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,827
The blood is coming out.

256
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,266
Hyun Tae.

257
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:44,719
Whatís wrong?

258
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,876
You were beaten by that aunty?

259
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:50,188
That auntyÖ

260
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,810
Mom, what?

261
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,983
Mom.

262
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:05,397
Why isnít it moving?

263
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:27,133
You closed this, what is to be done?

264
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,273
You pick it up.

265
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:29,490
Itís definitely that aunty.

266
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,976
What if itís your mom?

267
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:32,036
Ignore her first.

268
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:33,476
Quick quick.

269
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:34,958
Quick quick.

270
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:51,727
Could it be jammed?

271
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:52,991
Not picking up.

272
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,747
Continue calling.

273
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:58,496
If they still do not pick up this time, I will go up and teach them a lesson.

274
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:01,414
How can there be such people?

275
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:05,437
Just go pick it up, quick..

276
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,344
Yes, ahjussi.

277
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,548
I have diarrhea right now.

278
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,233
Yes, I know.

279
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,112
She says that she has diarrhea.

280
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,443
She says she will be down immediately.

281
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:21,567
You can go in first.

282
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,649
I will say it nicely.

283
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,799
You must teach her a lesson.

284
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,348
What runsÖ

285
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:31,050
Not right, she is not the kind that you can nicely persuade her.

286
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,924
I will never let her off.

287
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,895
Just look at this.

288
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:36,666
Itís because she pushed me it became like this.

289
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,657
Blood is coming out, what am I going to do?

290
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:39,917
Have to give it some oilment.

291
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,166
I will come back in awhile.

292
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,682
Continue calling.

293
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:43,591
Yes yes.

294
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,246
Ahjussi.

295
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,134
Yeah?

296
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,932
The elevator looks like itís stuck.

297
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:18,402
Oh looks like its working now.

298
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:19,167
Yes.

299
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,341
Thank you.

300
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:20,545
Yes.

301
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,453
What are we to do!

302
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:24,125
You should lock the door after I go in.

303
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,501
What to do?

304
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,361
Donít you have the keys? Keys.

305
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,748
Itís in the room.

306
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:30,391
Rooftop.

307
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:31,889
Quick climb up the ladder.

308
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,312
Rooftop.

309
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:34,174
Quick run.

310
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:57,467
This looks like Nan Heeís.

311
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:04,546
Yah!

312
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:05,438
You mom is gone?

313
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,374
What are you doing? Wearing my clothes?

314
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,206
Come out, come out.

315
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,156
Mom will open up to see it.

316
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:13,577
Then what do I do?

317
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:25,440
Mom.

318
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,456
You didnít contact me, how come you came so suddenly?

319
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:30,205
You mean I canít come to my daughterís house without first informing her?

320
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:33,453
I knew you will be like this.

321
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:37,141
This is yours right?

322
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,141
Where did you find it?

323
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:40,688
I have been looking for a long time for it.

324
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,063
Outside the elevator.

325
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:45,750
What shall I do with you?

326
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:49,769
You are already 30 and still you will lose your shoes?

327
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,798
Are you Cinderella?

328
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,002
You lost it when you got drunk didnít you?

329
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:54,953
It hurts, mom.

330
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,870
What state of mind are you living in to lose a shoe?

331
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,746
This is so depressing.

332
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,683
The sound is so irritating. Go and pick it up.

333
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,042
No need to pick it up.

334
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,430
It's so noisy, why donít you pick it?

335
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,278
Yes, yes.

336
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:16,681
I will be going down now.

337
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:19,247
What is it?

338
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:19,889
Mom.

339
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,548
I need to go down for awhile.

340
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:22,404
Why?

341
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:26,577
Doesnít mom like to eat cold noodles?

342
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:29,111
There is a really good cold noodles restaurant near by.

343
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:30,111
Letís go there to eat?

344
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:31,236
I have already eaten my dinner.

345
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,657
Quick go do your stuff.

346
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:34,919
Itís really nice, itís so nice that you will want to eat it again.

347
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:35,672
Letís go mom.

348
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,453
No need, Iíll eat it the next time.

349
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,532
Donít be like this, letís go out.

350
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:42,420
I just came, why are you chasing me out?

351
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,091
I didnít call and just came, you are not happy about it?

352
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,641
No it's not.
Of course it is not like that.

353
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:49,655
Then mom,

354
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,419
Come here, sit here.

355
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,623
There is the program that mom likes.

356
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:58,329
I will be back soon.

357
00:19:58,329 --> 00:19:59,828
What is wrong with this child?

358
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:01,328
Be good and stay here.

359
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:13,014
Such a nuisance.

360
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:29,502
The wind is so nice.

361
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:38,918
Her lifestyle is not bad?

362
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,356
She finished it so fast?

363
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:45,905
She should have called to ask, and then bring some for her.

364
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,964
She knows how to make salted pickles.

365
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:03,763
Rascal.

366
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,732
Her cooking is like mine, not bad.

367
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,854
Still not back yet?

368
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:33,043
Canít be.

369
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:46,184
Did she put it in this room?

370
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:53,480
Why canít this be opened?

371
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,826
Why? Something the matter?

372
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:03,717
Why did you open the balcony?

373
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:07,078
Your shoes! Why are you so in a hurry?

374
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:08,954
Itís not.

375
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,109
The insects will come in.

376
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:26,156
Byun Hyun Tae

377
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:33,330
What is on your back?

378
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,642
What?

379
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:50,019
Why are you wearing Hyun Taeís clothes?

380
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,767
When did I mom?

381
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:55,362
Isnít Byun Hyun Tae written on your back?

382
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:01,095
ThatÖ Hyun Tae said he didnít want to wear this.

383
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:02,550
So I took it to wear.

384
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,143
Are you a beggar?

385
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:06,549
A sports attire is not to expensive, you still need to get it from him?

386
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:07,176
Thatís right.

387
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,885
Quick take out, rascal.

388
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:11,595
How can you wear clothes with a guyís name on it?

389
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:13,239
Iíll take it off, take it off.

390
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:14,722
Donít close the door.

391
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:17,095
The wind is good. Why close it?

392
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,238
Oh, oh.

393
00:23:21,987 --> 00:23:23,695
Mom, shall I pour two glasses?

394
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,034
No need, itís fine.

395
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,283
Is the sheets placed in that room?

396
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,033
Then why is that room locked?

397
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,346
The door is broken.

398
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:37,549
I will get someone to repair it tomorrow.

399
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,362
It is better if I take a look at the blankets.

400
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,597
It's not too late yet.

401
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:43,832
Ask the locksmith to come now.

402
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,110
No need.

403
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,159
A place where a female stays, at this time, itís a littleÖ

404
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:48,724
Mom.

405
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,034
The blankets is really good.

406
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:51,673
Itís almost an art.

407
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,410
Really?

408
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,673
But, what is this?

409
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:57,346
The medicine I got for you.

410
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:59,927
I heard that Celastrus Orbiculatus Thunb is good for women.

411
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:00,848
Celastrus Orbiculatus Thunb?

412
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:03,235
Didnít you say that you suffer from menstrual pains?

413
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,157
This is very good.

414
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,298
Oh, is it?

415
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:08,531
I will use it well.

416
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,111
This month's period, did your breast hurt again?

417
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:12,236
Mom!

418
00:24:12,236 --> 00:24:13,844
What?

419
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:17,634
I will eat it up.

420
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,563
Thank you mom.

421
00:24:19,563 --> 00:24:20,845
Close the door?

422
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:22,360
Warm right?

423
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:24,518
When your abdomen hurtsÖ

424
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:25,988
Mom!

425
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:26,845
Gave me a fright!

426
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:29,345
Donít say anymore mom.

427
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:32,761
Why do you have to yell so loudly?

428
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:37,522
This is because you are not married yet.

429
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:40,914
If you just gave birth to a child, you wouldn't suffer from menstrual pains.

430
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,536
Why do you not live like normal people?

431
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:46,210
Having to eat expensive medicine because you don't take care of your body well.

432
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,931
Come to your senses!

433
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:54,211
Hello, this isÖ

434
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:57,048
Where did the flowers come from?

435
00:24:57,048 --> 00:24:58,932
Heard that you like flowers.

436
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,402
I donít really know about flowers.

437
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:02,665
I saw that these were rather fresh so I bought it.

438
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:03,620
Do you like it?

439
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,446
This weather is most suited for this type of flowers.

440
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:10,244
The fragrance is really nice.

441
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:12,322
So sorry about what happened yesterday.

442
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:18,179
Itís nothing. Now the teenagers nowadays are not so understanding. Itís easy to make mistakes.

443
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,744
But you and that girl are not really a couple are you?

444
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:29,903
Yes.

445
00:25:32,384 --> 00:25:34,495
Because of you, this is nothing.

446
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:35,603
What else can be done?

447
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,789
She will not accept my apologies.

448
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:41,839
Seeing her so happy, my mood gets better too.

449
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:44,244
But I am a little angry.

450
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:47,744
Looks like nothing can persuade her.

451
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:49,671
Do you know how many times I begged her?

452
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:52,464
Nowadays, women cannot resist flowers.

453
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:57,150
The only thing that can move you guys are a womanís naked body.

454
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,995
But the things that move us includes flowers, a lost doggy, sunset, a breeze.

455
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:09,274
Because of these, sometimes the perspective on life will change too.

456
00:26:44,118 --> 00:26:46,424
That is all for today.

457
00:26:46,424 --> 00:26:46,603
Thank you.

458
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:48,630
Yes, thank you.

459
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:52,785
Did something good happen today?

460
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,585
You are smiling like a flower.

461
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:58,372
Shin Ja.

462
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:00,405
How would you like if I let you be a matchmaker?

463
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:02,000
Thatís good of course.

464
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,541
What sort of a person?

465
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,718
Handsome looking, and courteous too.

466
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:09,391
If I have a daughter I will definitely make him my son-in-law.

467
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:11,370
Really?

468
00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:29,373
Writer Shin.

469
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:35,243
I am saying, if you add in this sort of scenarioÖ

470
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:39,590
Continue. I am listening.

471
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,185
Next time, letís have the meeting at the office.

472
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:46,012
Every time we have it here. It's not too good.

473
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,552
I like this place.

474
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:51,552
If you donít like it, you can change the concept.

475
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:53,717
Change the image? No, it's not like that.

476
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:56,741
Itís only giving little changes.

477
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:01,264
Writer Shinís forte is to push the emotions all the way to the climax.

478
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,878
After that to get the readerís tears.

479
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:05,924
Hence, exhibit this capability a little more.

480
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,405
Hong Nan Hee.

481
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:13,764
You have pointed out flaws in my article for more that an hour.

482
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:17,224
Now you say that is a good point.

483
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:20,314
Canít believe it.

484
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:27,635
Me. I am very curious, if there are so many problems, why are you still publishing it?

485
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:32,549
I can always look for another company.

486
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:37,925
Then, what are Writer Shinís thoughts?

487
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:42,594
Follow what is here now? Just publish it out like this?

488
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:44,392
You wish to become a writer too?

489
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,762
I have a lot of contacts with publishing firms.

490
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:52,948
There are always people like you there.

491
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:56,730
You have some writing skills, but never got the opportunity to shine as a writer.

492
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,058
Since you wanted to work with books, you got a job at a publishing company.

493
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:04,137
But...even these kind of stories gets published.

494
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:07,595
Exactly why can't this world see a talented gem like me?

495
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:08,901
One word.

496
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:17,009
That is you are so jealous of me.

497
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:31,090
I need to go to the washroom.

498
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:54,118
Endure it, endure it. Prize money.

499
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:06,566
Donít be like this.

500
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:11,831
If you cry, you wonít have self-respect.

501
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,574
Survey.

502
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:18,360
A car which is designed for ladies.

503
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,231
What exactly do you want?

504
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,771
You will help right?

505
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:23,531
Why did you turn so enthusiastic out of a sudden?

506
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,771
This client has been our regular customer for a long time.

507
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:28,138
If otherís get the deal, it's so embarrassing.

508
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:29,909
Why is it so thick?

509
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:32,541
Asking one by one, only then will the good ideas come out.

510
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,331
Fighting.

511
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:47,507
Senior, senior!

512
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:49,254
Hyun Tae

513
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,177
This time, Senior has to help me.

514
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:52,401
I am very busy.

515
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:54,058
There are 9 recording today.

516
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:57,632
Today, I drew my lip with an eyeliner, then I fell asleep.

517
00:30:57,632 --> 00:30:59,932
If you have the time to put on make-up means you are still living.

518
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:02,067
If this is not done by Senior, there is no one else.

519
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:05,737
Here, the lines are already coming up, didnít you see?

520
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:08,639
It looks good too, looks nice!

521
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:09,379
Fine.

522
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:10,982
Noona, let me ok?

523
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:13,207
Please, only Noona can help me.

524
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,474
No way.

525
00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:16,405
Just help him.

526
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:22,193
This rascal. Such a blasting work attitude.

527
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:29,024
I will put my faith in Noona.

528
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:31,078
Yah!

529
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:36,528
Hyun Tae, would you like to work on this project by yourself?

530
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:37,872
Director!

531
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:42,424
I'll just watch what you do, so create your team, prepare the meeting, presentation and everything by yourself.

532
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,451
Even the presentation?

533
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,736
You want me to do the presentation? For G Motors? Even the bidding?

534
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:51,543
How can I do...

535
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,650
I'll try to do it.

536
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,250
What do you mean try? Don't you know that this is a big project?

537
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,451
Are you just going to give up if you can't do it?

538
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:04,499
No! I will do it!

539
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,639
Youíre so biased!

540
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,905
I have to see how you do first.

541
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:14,640
Work on your ideas more.

542
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,265
Congratulations!

543
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:18,672
It's nothing to congratulate me for.

544
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,968
Hong, itís me.

545
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:25,279
You may be busy, but listen.

546
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,421
I wanted to tell you first.

547
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:32,122
I finally get to present!

548
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:37,467
Why are you screaming?!

549
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,044
Didnít you know?

550
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:46,204
Your 30th and my 30th were different to begin with.

551
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:54,080
My job now is to present the worldís.. Hello?

552
00:32:56,096 --> 00:33:02,220
What the.. She didnít even congratulate me..

553
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:21,898
I did it!!!!

554
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,167
Are you crazy?!

555
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,588
What are you doing?!!

556
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,182
What did I do?

557
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:46,152
Yeah! I am crazy!!

558
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:48,745
What gives you the right to talk about me?

559
00:33:48,745 --> 00:33:51,971
How can you make the people that couldnít become authors losers,

560
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:55,871
that lost their spot to someone like you?

561
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:59,526
Yeah, it does make me mad that a book like this gets published!

562
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:00,870
You call that jealousy?!

563
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,269
Youíre not even close.

564
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:05,869
How can you look down on someone for something worthless like this?!

565
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:08,156
Have you shaken up and changed Koreaís culture?!

566
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:10,895
Everybody has written something like this!

567
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:15,268
Trash with a shallow storyline, spelling and grammar all wrong!

568
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:18,870
Iím jealous of your shameless ability to call yourself and author!

569
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,590
Youíre such a.. Arghh..

570
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:54,784
Do you want me to look up the car functions as well?

571
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:58,376
Weíre legally not allowed to, so no.

572
00:34:58,376 --> 00:34:59,989
Is that so?

573
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:02,393
Can you give me 20 more of these?

574
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,972
Never mind, I can make copies.

575
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:07,033
Can I pass this around to my friends?

576
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,111
Of course you can!

577
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:13,364
But.. it has to be informally done.

578
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:15,785
You canít pass it out for them to keep, but you can show it to them.

579
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:17,189
Ok.

580
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:18,167
Thank you.

581
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:24,816
You seemed to be working so hard, I felt I needed to help somehow.

582
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:27,802
I do have the ability to stimulate maternal instinct.

583
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:32,073
Stop stimulating, Iím getting dizzy.

584
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,939
I know, I know.

585
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,830
No extra copying, no leaking it out.

586
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,915
About 50 copies?

587
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:47,285
We have a lot of female employees.

588
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:48,863
Ok. Bye.

589
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:51,004
Kwon Joo!

590
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:53,022
I heard youíre getting married.

591
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:54,540
Congratulations!

592
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,775
Thank you.

593
00:35:55,775 --> 00:35:57,713
Where is it going to be?

594
00:35:57,713 --> 00:35:59,274
In Dae Chi Dong.

595
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:02,104
Youíre going to send out the invitations right?

596
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:03,193
You must be so happy.

597
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:04,983
Congratulations!

598
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:07,921
I heard youíre leaving the company.

599
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:09,046
Yes.

600
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,780
Letís go eat.

601
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,670
Ok.

602
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,005
Iíll see you later.

603
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,484
Senior!

604
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:19,500
Can you help me? I moved some data,

605
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,553
but it needs the touch-up of a professional.

606
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:23,935
Ok.

607
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,118
Whatís that? What about the data?

608
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:37,039
Eat. You love sushi.

609
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,076
What about the data?

610
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:43,275
Letís eat, you wonít see me if itís not like this.

611
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:44,449
Fine, ok.

612
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:47,688
When else am I going to eat sushi?

613
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:55,963
Now I canít watch you get on the bus when you go home late.

614
00:36:55,963 --> 00:37:00,182
Itís not dangerous with or without you watching.

615
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:04,852
Make sure to watch the weather forecasts and donít forget your umbrella.

616
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:06,524
Ok.

617
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,462
You always get sick around this time of year.

618
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:14,087
Now that you canít deliver medicine, Iíll take it myself.

619
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:18,373
Iím sorry I couldnít wait for you longer.

620
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:22,652
Hey, other people will think weíve dated.

621
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:27,683
If it was going to end like this, you couldíve at least dated me.

622
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:35,293
Iím sorry I couldnít, but you met someone better!

623
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,137
Be happy.

624
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:39,528
You too.

625
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:41,152
Eat!

626
00:37:48,606 --> 00:37:52,687
You should have cried earlier, itís becoming of you.

627
00:37:58,137 --> 00:38:00,354
Of course Iím doing good.

628
00:38:00,354 --> 00:38:03,800
Did you get the mail daddy sent you?

629
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,687
I heard Australia gets cold around now.

630
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:11,576
What about mom?

631
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:17,716
Sheís out again? With who?

632
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:19,762
<i>Thank you for using our services.</i>

633
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:21,883
Is this Mr...

634
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,728
How are you valued customer, this is Lotte Card.

635
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:46,776
Youíve called the wrong number.

636
00:38:46,776 --> 00:38:49,212
Sir!

637
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,619
We are unable to connect..

638
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:09,308
What the! Youíve picked the wrong day.

639
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,504
I WILL get your money!

640
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,045
Youíre dead.

641
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:20,546
Ha, you work at a big company but canít pay the 1400 you borrowed?

642
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:23,482
Youíre dead.

643
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:29,082
Hi, may I talk to Mr. Im?

644
00:39:29,082 --> 00:39:32,390
What?! He left?!

645
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,544
When?

646
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,371
Let him down. Donít touch if youíre not going to buy,

647
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:45,189
Look only. Ok? Whoís going to buy one?

648
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:48,465
Wow itís a baby chick!

649
00:39:48,465 --> 00:39:49,451
Are you going to buy one?

650
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:50,011
No.

651
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:53,217
Then why are you touching it? Stop.

652
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:56,574
Who has money?

653
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:58,292
No one?

654
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:02,950
Do you have any idea what sheís worth?!

655
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,669
We could build a building for our company!

656
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:08,527
Do you have any idea what youíve done?!

657
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:12,498
Do you know what I had to do to get her to work with us?!?!

658
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:15,504
Does pride put food on the table? Have I not had my pride hurt?!

659
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:16,466
whyís she so angry?

660
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:18,949
It seems Nan Hee had a fight,

661
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,251
Itís the same for me.

662
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:25,387
If I want to save this company, I have to go around and ask for money.

663
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:27,523
No matter how wrong or unfair it may be,

664
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:31,126
I have to smile and work around the authors.

665
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:33,746
What kind of person are you?

666
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:36,388
Iíll meet her again.

667
00:40:36,388 --> 00:40:39,813
And do what? Fight again?

668
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:43,357
She already returned the contract money.

669
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:49,003
Iím sorry, Iíll beg her if I need to.

670
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:51,263
Iíll do whatever she asks.

671
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:52,931
With that pride?

672
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:54,882
Itís not about pride.

673
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:59,867
Thatís ok, I donít need an author that wonít work with my baby.

674
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,634
Is she the only author in the world?

675
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,117
She should know that a publishing company is her partner.

676
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:06,447
How dare she treat us like weíre unworthy?!

677
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:10,307
She should just print it and send it off with that attitude.

678
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:11,882
Boss.

679
00:41:11,882 --> 00:41:14,555
Iím not saying you did no wrong.

680
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:20,243
Figure out what you did wrong when she said those things to you.

681
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:23,085
If you really cared about her.

682
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:27,882
Or if it was you, if you would have acted differently.

683
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:32,995
Manager Hong, if you think a publisher is all about you, you canít be one.

684
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:38,075
The author wrote the book, itís a publisherís job to understand that book.

685
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:40,479
Understood?

686
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:43,419
Think about what your role is.

687
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,460
Yes maíam.

688
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:55,860
Have some pride in the fact that thereís a space for your name next to the authorís.

689
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,563
How did your job go?

690
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:10,032
Yes, the money will be transferred around next week.

691
00:42:10,032 --> 00:42:13,086
Everyoneís having such a hard time..

692
00:42:13,086 --> 00:42:16,846
Thereís not a single job thatís being done.

693
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:28,499
<i>She was right.</i>

694
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:34,954
<i>The reason I wasnít able to act like an adult and became hysterical was because..</i>

695
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:47,205
<i>I looked upon my job the same way she did. Pride..</i>

696
00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:50,313
Chirp?

697
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:56,797
Whatís that noise?

698
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:05,707
It was too cute.

699
00:43:07,908 --> 00:43:14,582
It must be nice to live with no worries like you.

700
00:43:25,283 --> 00:43:27,970
Research results.

701
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,123
Permanent number.

702
00:43:30,123 --> 00:43:35,643
For highly valued players, each pro baseball team has a number they'll retire forever to pay tribute.

703
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:42,469
Yeap. It means taken out of my woman list forever.

704
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:48,895
So youíre saying, Nan Hee is a special player in your life, but not a woman.

705
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:50,533
Yup.

706
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:55,830
So that means she was on the list, in the past.

707
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:00,846
Ohh, you wonít deny.

708
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:09,869
Doesnít it seem that if someone knows one secret, you keep showing them more?

709
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:14,431
That means Iím comfortable to be around, right?

710
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:20,861
As I watch our marketing targets, I sometimes find answers.

711
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,437
What do you think her wish is?

712
00:44:23,824 --> 00:44:27,959
Since wishes are linked to purchases.

713
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:33,874
She looks like she needs love.

714
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:37,483
I think so too.

715
00:44:37,857 --> 00:44:43,747
That secret is a burden to me.

716
00:44:45,335 --> 00:44:47,699
Why did we have to meet like that?

717
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:50,821
He must have thought me as easy.

718
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:57,012
When I think about it, it gives me goosebumps.

719
00:44:57,012 --> 00:45:00,661
I must look like an easy person to you.

720
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:03,801
Youíre a guy.

721
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:09,350
Thereís nothing different.

722
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:16,304
What wish do you see?

723
00:45:16,304 --> 00:45:21,614
Iíve sent signals, but thereís been no response, so take a good look.

724
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,990
Youíre not in my marketing target.

725
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,037
If I bother you, do you want me to leave the company?

726
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:30,523
Donít joke around.

727
00:45:30,523 --> 00:45:32,661
Is it because of Nan Hee unni?

728
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:35,162
Discontinuation of research. Do you not understand?

729
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:37,728
Then why?

730
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:45,851
I.. I donít have confidence in love.

731
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:53,806
Why? I liked you.

732
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:55,975
Iíve got a new project.

733
00:45:55,975 --> 00:46:01,461
They want someone that matches a well known author like you.

734
00:46:02,524 --> 00:46:08,184
But unni, why did you like working with me?

735
00:46:08,184 --> 00:46:16,038
You gave me ideas when I had none and were there for me.

736
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:19,023
I liked working with you too.

737
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:20,867
I felt like I was trusted.

738
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:24,553
It was mutual.

739
00:46:26,395 --> 00:46:29,321
Now that a new personís coming, I feel out of place.

740
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:31,574
Itíll be refreshing and good.

741
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:36,480
Be my age. Itís stressful to meet new people.

742
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:43,468
If I could live like this, Iíd live alone.

743
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:48,198
Iíd have the capability and the money.

744
00:46:48,198 --> 00:46:51,720
Doing only what I want to..

745
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,513
This is why there are terms like Ďroyally singleí.

746
00:46:55,842 --> 00:46:57,385
Royally single?

747
00:46:57,385 --> 00:46:59,619
Isnít it?

748
00:47:00,136 --> 00:47:05,949
On New Years, I didnít want to cook, so I decided to eat out.

749
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:12,524
But the streets were empty and everything was closed.

750
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:18,493
When I finally found a restaurant, there were 2 foreigners.

751
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:24,152
We sat there listening to traffic news.

752
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:28,513
Take that for royally single.

753
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,230
Youíre worse than my mom.

754
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,135
Do you want to drink?

755
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:36,498
Yes.

756
00:47:36,498 --> 00:47:40,760
Iím here. Wow, the bakery was really far.

757
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,898
Whoís that?

758
00:47:41,898 --> 00:47:43,025
Youíre new partner.

759
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,150
Hello, my name is Kim Nam Jung.

760
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,385
I bought a cake since this is my first time here.

761
00:47:47,385 --> 00:47:50,025
The plates are over there and forks are in the second drawer.

762
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:51,165
Ok.

763
00:47:54,444 --> 00:47:57,838
What an evil body.

764
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,838
Evil girl..

765
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:01,461
Hello.

766
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,057
Hello.

767
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:21,710
Weíre home.

768
00:48:28,518 --> 00:48:30,877
Hereís your food.

769
00:48:33,164 --> 00:48:36,126
Chirp Chirp..

770
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:47,434
Try this.

771
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:03,811
Nan Hee, what are you doing?

772
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:15,794
30, why is that the end?

773
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:18,966
If the 20 is relative to a flower, 30 is like a tree.

774
00:49:19,185 --> 00:49:25,108
What Iím saying is that right at that age, you get to bloom once more.

775
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:28,581
We can call that heavenís consideration for us.

776
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:36,047
See, youíre in bloom. Love will come.

777
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:42,201
Whatís important is who you meet.

778
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:47,461
The type of love you have will change your life.

779
00:49:47,461 --> 00:49:54,842
Youíre unable to give your all because you donít know if heís the one.

780
00:49:54,842 --> 00:50:00,123
But youíre scared to let go, because this may be the last.

781
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:04,920
And youíre worried whether you have the strength left to start over.

782
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,816
Your heartís gone, but your body isnít.

783
00:50:07,816 --> 00:50:11,623
When your bodyís left you, your brain is thinking about something else.

784
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:15,226
And as you go from here to there, bang! You..

785
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:16,938
Ahhhh!! Stop

786
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:21,398
These days, 30 isnít anything.

787
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:28,202
I thought the same when I had a rude butt like yours.

788
00:50:29,954 --> 00:50:36,566
This is the point where your life changes.

789
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,515
A woman dies twice.

790
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:46,577
When she stops breathing and when this stops working.

791
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:51,292
Just because youíre single, do you think you,

792
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:55,696
donít worry about being able to have a baby?

793
00:50:55,696 --> 00:51:00,462
Just in case, shouldnít we freeze some eggs cells?

794
00:51:00,462 --> 00:51:02,656
I heard it hurts a lot.

795
00:51:02,656 --> 00:51:04,121
Really? You looked into it?

796
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:08,920
I felt I wonít get married until Iím old.

797
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,369
You lately notice muscular men right?

798
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,230
Yes.

799
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:18,282
Thatís a signal from here saying:

800
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:27,369
ďthereís not much time left for me. Please give me some lively genes!Ē

801
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:34,197
So thatís why Manager Hongís meeting a guy like that!

802
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:35,836
What? A guy?!

803
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:40,960
You betrayer!

804
00:51:42,163 --> 00:51:43,997
What kind of guy is he?

805
00:51:43,997 --> 00:51:46,498
Just come, you wonít believe it.

806
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:48,873
Ok!

807
00:52:18,085 --> 00:52:19,851
What are you doing?

808
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:26,163
Iím getting energy. I must absorb all his youth.

809
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:32,700
Hey hey! You try it too!

810
00:52:44,748 --> 00:52:51,947
Heís so cute! It should be illegal to be so cute.

811
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:57,404
I donít appreciate this kind of attention!

812
00:52:57,826 --> 00:53:04,351
His body.. itís like.. so beautiful.

813
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,977
Thatís what Iím saying.

814
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:23,055
Why are you outside?

815
00:53:23,055 --> 00:53:24,885
It was a little stifling.

816
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:28,304
Did you have too much to drink?

817
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:33,389
Youíre sweating. You can stop singing.

818
00:53:33,389 --> 00:53:36,258
Youíve already won them over.

819
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:38,165
Iím so happy right now.

820
00:53:38,165 --> 00:53:40,728
Really? Then Iím happy too.

821
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:42,841
Itís the first time you showed me your friends.

822
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:45,981
That means youíre not embarrassed by me.

823
00:53:45,981 --> 00:53:48,905
Did it bother you that much?

824
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:59,762
You broke your nail again! It must hurt..

825
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:05,434
Do you know what I thought about while we were apart?

826
00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:12,453
Iím going to go to the major league regardless of the calluses or broken nails.

827
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:18,811
Just watch. Iíll be the most boast-worthy man in your life.

828
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:25,417
What can I do? What should I do? Iíve been as bold as to love her.

829
00:54:57,823 --> 00:55:02,363
He is suffocatingly lovable..

830
00:55:02,363 --> 00:55:05,698
If he was born in 86, I was a high school sophomore.

831
00:55:05,698 --> 00:55:09,445
So when I was watching the Asian Games on TV, he was born.

832
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:10,253
What about his army service?

833
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,451
Of course he hasnít gone.

834
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,231
I donít care.

835
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:26,917
I like Jung Joo!

836
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,932
Youíre going to visit home?

837
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:54,964
Yes.

838
00:55:54,964 --> 00:55:58,025
Thatís nice! Iím sure your parents missed you.

839
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:02,901
When you come back, Iíll paint your nails for you.

840
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:06,217
It hurts me to see them broken.

841
00:56:06,682 --> 00:56:07,629
Noona!

842
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:08,816
What?

843
00:56:16,395 --> 00:56:18,895
ďmotelĒ

844
00:56:19,178 --> 00:56:22,715
Donít go home tonight.

845
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:25,804
Stay with me.

846
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:01,438
Youíre home?

847
00:58:01,438 --> 00:58:04,761
Itís been a long time since I heard you play.

848
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:12,513
Because youíve been home like a puppy, I had forgotten for a while.

849
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:19,546
You even had her picture out.

850
00:58:21,218 --> 00:58:27,466
Seung Hwan has a pretty smile.

851
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:37,465
After he died and I was having such a hard time.

852
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:44,667
Why did she leave me right then?

853
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:50,498
Iím going to bed.

854
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:16,870
How can he not forget her still?

855
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:25,357
You guys fought? Why?

856
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:31,058
Itís because... never mind

857
00:59:31,832 --> 00:59:34,513
So thatís what it is.

858
00:59:34,513 --> 00:59:40,168
Youíve been dating over a year, heís more than ready and you arenít.

859
00:59:40,168 --> 00:59:43,723
Yeah! Thatís what it is!

860
00:59:43,723 --> 00:59:47,529
Why? Why arenít you?

861
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,434
Iím scared,,

862
00:59:49,434 --> 00:59:53,283
Ahaha, whatís this fake innocence?

863
00:59:54,623 --> 01:00:00,558
Itís his first time!

864
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:05,235
Even though Iím old, Iím still a girl!

865
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:10,670
Do you know how hard it is for the girl to lead in that?

866
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:14,074
Why am I his first love?

867
01:00:14,074 --> 01:00:17,858
Thatís all a lie! You know kids these days.

868
01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:19,574
Does he look like heíll lie?

869
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:26,199
Heís simple. He lied because he thought youíd think him as an animal and lied.

870
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:27,685
NO.

871
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:32,144
You donít know men, if a man is 22, thereís no way..

872
01:00:32,144 --> 01:00:39,247
No. When I kiss him, I can feel it.

873
01:00:39,247 --> 01:00:45,420
I tried the next step, and I could tell.

874
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,075
Are you a player?

875
01:00:47,075 --> 01:00:51,396
I know your list and you arenít skilled enough to know.

876
01:00:51,396 --> 01:00:53,700
Itís not because Iím a player.

877
01:00:53,700 --> 01:01:01,371
When you kiss, you can tell whether your souls are sharing the same feelings.

878
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:02,983
Heís just pushing on.

879
01:01:02,983 --> 01:01:04,281
Yeah, that!

880
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:05,020
Like a boar.

881
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,358
Hey!

882
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:11,894
Well, yea, something like that.

883
01:01:11,894 --> 01:01:14,173
There should be a rhythm.

884
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:17,128
With your lips and breathing.

885
01:01:17,128 --> 01:01:22,396
Leading and giving in and in turn, feeling a sort of sharing?

886
01:01:22,396 --> 01:01:28,551
The sexy feeling you get from the warm comfort?

887
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:34,894
How can a baseball player not do that?

888
01:01:34,894 --> 01:01:39,727
Is it because he only pitches?

889
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:43,087
Just do it naturally!

890
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:51,176
Itís because it doesnít work out naturally, if it did, we would have gone to the next level, but he keeps..

891
01:01:51,176 --> 01:01:52,830
Letís go!

892
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:54,925
Iím talking..

893
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:55,973
Iím hungry!

894
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:58,127
Whatís wrong? Hey?!

895
01:01:58,127 --> 01:02:00,161
Let go!

896
01:02:00,161 --> 01:02:02,064
Why are you getting angry?

897
01:02:02,064 --> 01:02:06,002
Iím being serious, youíre making me embarrassed.

898
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:07,099
Donít do it.

899
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,422

Donít do anything.

01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:12,799
Donít kiss him and donít do anything else.

Donít even meet him.
