{\a6} "All ballplayers should quit when it starts to feel
as if all the baselines run uphill. " - Babe Ruth

00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,096
Ji Sun.

5
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:35,883
We went to buy the groceries together,

6
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,834
Nan Hee unni suddenly said
that something came up...

7
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:45,355
You wouldn't believe what I just said, right?

8
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:50,976
You are making me out
to be a bad person, right?

9
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:53,604
You're chasing me out?

10
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:55,821
I'm still thinking about that.

11
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,025
I won't go.

12
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,219
Ha! Look at you!

13
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:01,899
Even if I'm told to go, I'm supposed to refuse.

14
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:02,578
Who told you that?

15
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,604
Nan Hee unni.

16
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:07,099
And I was wondering why all this
seem to have a touch of her?

17
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:09,879
Bad girl, she loves to mind
other people's business.

18
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,636
Tell her to run her own life well.

19
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:17,098
Noona!

20
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,900
Jung Joo!

21
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:21,140
Nan Hee!

22
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:39,627
- Let's go out.
- I won't go.

23
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,324
Aren't you afraid?

24
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,916
Cooking a meal with a single man?

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,405
Don't trust a man so easily.

26
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:50,727
Have you seen a wolf bullying a woman?

27
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:52,448
And...

28
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,055
And amongst the pack,

29
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:05,114
I'm the worst one.

30
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:07,461
Let's go.

31
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:16,949
How could he pounce on you like that?
Hugging a complete stranger!

32
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,355
I told you he got the wrong person, right?

33
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:20,857
Even so, you shouldn't have slapped him.

34
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:23,043
What if he retaliates and hugs you again?

35
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,917
I was caught off guard.

36
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,678
Why?

37
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:12,571
Nothing, mom.

38
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:34,381
[Nan Hee]

39
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:45,120
So embarrassing.

40
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,314
Ji Sun.

41
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:53,077
Why do you always make me feel bad?

42
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,758
If that happens often,

43
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:59,529
Maybe because of it
I'll get to hold onto you.

44
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,746
Mom, let's go to the convenience store.

45
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,538
Why?

46
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:13,483
I forgot to buy soy sauce. I'm all out.

47
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:14,444
Go ahead.

48
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,064
I'll head up first.

49
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,428
Give me the keys.

50
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,737
Oh yes, I use the number code, right?

51
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,249
Go with me, mom.

52
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,093
I told you to go ahead
on your own, what's wrong?

53
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,911
<i>Noona!</i>

54
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,511
Unni!

55
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:11,597
This guy...

56
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:14,924
Is the one earlier, right?

57
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:18,144
Let's go.

58
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,777
Are you angry?

59
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,705
That's why you came back?

60
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:24,104
Oh, women are all like that.

61
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:28,956
When we get hugged by strangers,
of course our hands automatically go up.

62
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:30,450
Mom...

63
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:31,710
That's not correct, actually...

64
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,674
Just keep still, you're living on your own
so don't make any enemies.

65
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:36,425
Mother!

66
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:41,547
Who?

67
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:44,549
Oh, this guy!

68
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,332
He... what's up with him?

69
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,123
I...

70
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,490
I'm her boyfriend.

71
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,447
Boyfriend?

72
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,748
That's...

73
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,069
What's that?

74
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,904
Oh! I've lived for so long,
this is the first time...

75
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:11,641
Mother!

76
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,360
Stop calling me that.
When I hear it, I get even angrier.

77
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,137
Jung Joo, you should go back now.

78
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:17,565
It's better if I do the explaining on my own.

79
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:20,511
No. I have things to say too.

80
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,093
Of course you have to speak up.

81
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,286
Mom, let Jung Joo go.
Let's talk at a quiet place.

82
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,378
I'll explain things to you slowly.

83
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:32,896
Noona, rest your heart.

84
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:35,299
I'm confident of convincing mother.

85
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,756
Can't you see I'm at
the limit of my patience?

86
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,017
Open the door quickly.

87
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,878
Mom!

88
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,243
<i>Why aren't you opening the door?</i>

89
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,370
Shoes!

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,568
Why aren't you coming in?

91
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,799
Seems like you get spot checked pretty often.

92
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:30,021
You just acted like a well-drilled soldier.

93
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,532
I should chase that one out quickly!

94
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,223
Today, your image has been
destroyed quite a bit.

95
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,040
What?

96
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,465
Isn't it? You were chasing me off
so cruelly but look at you now.

97
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm hungry. Don't talk to me.

98
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,943
Shall I sneak out and get us
some food in here?

99
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,347
Are you having fun?

100
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:53,694
Ah! Don't we have the groceries?

101
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:00,246
Is this a picnic for you?

102
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,673
Although I feel bad for those outside,

103
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:06,020
I'm actually enjoying myself very much here.

104
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:10,539
Luckily, we have survival food.

105
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:14,575
Why don't you say luckily you
have someone to chat with?

106
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:16,545
You want some juice?

107
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:17,798
No.

108
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,026
You shouldn't drink too
in case you need the toilet.

109
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:25,258
I think I came on the right day.

110
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,344
<i>Don't tell me you really want to marry?</i>

111
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:29,204
<i>Mom!</i>

112
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:38,931
I really love noona.

113
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,668
Truly.

114
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,950
I'm sick of hearing those words. Stop that.

115
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:46,533
Tell me. Can you get married?

116
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:52,649
Then...

117
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:56,563
With no thoughts at all about marriage,
you're clinging onto someone of age?

118
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,722
I'm now...

119
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,839
What marriage?
He's still a student.

120
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:02,300
You know that yet you're doing this?

121
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:25,320
<i>I'm willing to get married.</i>

122
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,676
<i>I want to.</i>

123
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:29,005
He was forced to say he wants to.

124
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,628
You happy now?

125
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,513
Hong Nan Hee, are you happy?

126
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:35,381
Destroying the bright future of
a promising young man right here.

127
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:39,232
Living in poverty with someone who
doesn't making a living, you like that?

128
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:40,414
Will you be happy?

129
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:43,717
So why did you have to bring up marriage
all of a sudden, you scared him.

130
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:44,881
Scared?

131
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,304
Did he get the worse shock or did I?

132
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:51,738
Actually, I planned to get married
before I go to Major League in America.

133
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:56,372
Speaking honestly, I don't
have much ability currently.

134
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,965
Fool! You should have just left,
why did you come back?

135
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,214
So what if he left?

136
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:07,089
Behind my back you'll be
dating him till you're old?

137
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:08,950
Wake up! You!

138
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:12,167
When you're 40, will he still be looking at you?

139
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:12,813
Mother!

140
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,712
Didn't I tell you to stop calling me that?

141
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,441
I...

142
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,495
I'm not that kind of jerk.

143
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,332
Really...

144
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:32,194
I wanted to be...

145
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,344
An adult of age too.

146
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,252
I love noona.

147
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,414
I'll take full responsibility.

148
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:47,885
We will not break up.

149
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,414
Shut up!

150
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:54,425
You're like a shivering child before me,
how can I entrust my daughter to you?

151
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:56,762
This is such a cruel world,

152
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,769
Did you move out to live like this?

153
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,514
Pack up right away!

154
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:04,023
I can't let you live like this.

155
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:05,041
Mom!

156
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:07,555
Otherwise, break up in front of me now.

157
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:08,829
Mother!

158
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,149
I can't do without noona.

159
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,152
I'll work very hard.

160
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:17,432
Mom, give us some time.

161
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,821
Noona, no!

162
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:22,756
Time? What time?
This is foregone conclusion.

163
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,941
How can you force us like this?

164
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,663
Mom, this is your first meeting with him,

165
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:30,135
But we've spent many months together.

166
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:35,661
Yes?

167
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:44,807
Just leave it there.
We don't know when she'll come again.

168
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:46,643
Troublesome.

169
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,822
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:49,638 --> 00:11:51,304
You want some beer?

171
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:17,614
Not daring to say anything,
he just stood there so embarrassed.

172
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:19,199
Did he complain?

173
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,389
Compared to that,

174
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:28,474
The distance between us is just stifling!

175
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,292
It's true.

176
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,181
How can he not be shocked?

177
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,154
Forcing a child, who has yet
to serve the army, to get married.

178
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,593
So?

179
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:42,658
What's your plan?

180
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,546
Now that your mom knows about it,

181
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:20,374
From now on, it's a time bomb
just waiting to explode.

182
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,412
So it is.

183
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:26,355
It has to come to an end soon.

184
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:30,028
Either I get married immediately,

185
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,229
Or I convince my mom to wait some more,

186
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,763
Or I wave and say bye bye.

187
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:39,007
Love...

188
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,346
Will always have an ending.

189
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,316
Hey!

190
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,891
Those grey stuff on women's faces...

191
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:58,380
- Spots?
- Yes. You have that!

192
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,657
- Really?
- Yes.

193
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:05,708
Really!

194
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:08,893
I've only been upset for
a few hours and here they come!

195
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,583
Use your brains a bit more.

196
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,217
Otherwise when there's a sudden attack,
of course your body can't take it.

197
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,915
Hyung Tae.

198
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,231
Here. White hair.

199
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,449
So what?
You want me to pluck it?

200
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,513
What?

201
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:32,500
Hyung Tae.

202
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,510
All this while, I've been waiting
for the punk to be ready.

203
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,069
When the time comes,

204
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,023
If that passionate kid turns cold,

205
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,845
And I'm no longer a woman
in his eyes, what will I do?

206
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:48,051
I'm already growing white hair.

207
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,506
If Jung Joo realizes that there are many more
younger and prettier girls than me in this world,

208
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:56,229
You'll totally lose out.

209
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,799
Madam Kim,

210
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:02,707
She really opened up the
big door of reality for me.

211
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,188
It has been opened all along.

212
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:09,084
You are fools to realize it only now, you two!

213
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:10,823
First,

214
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,779
Pull this out.

215
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:17,937
Hey! Got it. Get up first.

216
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,452
Can you see?

217
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:23,024
What are you lying down on?
Got it. I know.

218
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,800
Put your hand down.
Where's the white hair?

219
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,699
Here it is. So much!

220
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:29,747
A lot?

221
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:32,863
It's not supposed to be a calligraphy brush,
why are there so many?

222
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,700
Ah!

223
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,543
Hey!

224
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:40,629
You'd better shave it all off.

225
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:44,533
You stroking my hair like this,
I'm feeling the fatigue.

226
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,881
But what shall I do?

227
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:58,181
From now on, mom is going
to come here often.

228
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,650
It's alright, it's Jung Joo.

229
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,943
Oh my goodness! Really!

230
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,632
Noona!

231
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:16,355
Noona.

232
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:17,997
Jung Joo.

233
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:20,132
You can't be like this now.

234
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:22,292
You still have your test, don't you?

235
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,369
Just focus on that for now.

236
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,114
Oh my gosh!

237
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,603
You said it was supposed to be a secret
but you went and leaked it out yourself.

238
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,365
You're totally naive.

239
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:36,476
What if you fail to make it because of me
like in the nationals selection the last time?

240
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,657
Noona, I'm very depressed.

241
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:41,517
I'm very depressed.

242
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,790
Next time, remember to press
the doorbell, I got a bad shock.

243
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:49,753
Hyungnim, I hurt so much.

244
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:53,435
It's all up to you.

245
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:02,950
Who cares whether you marry or not.

246
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,218
<i>Do you have enough for bus fare?</i>

247
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,595
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

248
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,327
<i>I'll give you some.
Get a taxi.</i>

249
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,567
<i>Lunatic!</i>

250
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:25,484
<i>You even have to give him pocket money?</i>

251
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:35,131
Just do what you want.

252
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,693
- Oh! You scared me!
- You're up?

253
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:16,487
Hey! Because of you, my heart is failing.

254
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:19,990
I'll live on with vigor, I'll try my best.

255
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,982
No matter the outcome, I'll try my best.

256
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,366
Who ever asked you about that?

257
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:28,136
It's a decision I made for myself.

258
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,766
It's not like you're some acrobat here.

259
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,203
Hyung Tae.

260
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:43,996
It's great that we're friends.

261
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:45,248
What?

262
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:46,745
Love is...

263
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:50,063
Either marriage or break up,
there'll surely be an outcome.

264
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:52,717
But friends can remain forever.

265
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,639
Without end, continuing...

266
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,817
Even in future, forever...

267
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:17,453
Hey!

268
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,841
My reward for being your friend.

269
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:20,559
What?

270
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:21,707
Cook for me.

271
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,476
Oh! You're here.

272
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,642
Hello.

273
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,186
Weren't you here to see it all last week?

274
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,303
Didn't you say there were some changes?

275
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:42,381
Did you come just for that?

276
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:44,499
In order to publish the correct details,

277
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:46,612
I have to see it myself so I make no mistakes.

278
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:48,994
It's really hot today. Here.

279
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,188
Yes it is. Thanks!

280
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,803
Where's the other one?

281
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,649
That adorable new staff.

282
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:56,812
Ah! Ji Sun?

283
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,210
She went for training.

284
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:02,624
That's too bad. She said she liked tea
so I bought it specially for her.

285
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:07,311
Actually, I'm the one who likes tea.

286
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:08,700
Is that so?

287
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:11,929
There's no tea in our vending machines,
she had to go all the way to the convenience store.

288
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:13,867
So I thought she was the one who likes it.

289
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,282
I really couldn't tell, Manager Byun.

290
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:19,794
Aren't you a really fussy boss?

291
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:22,167
If you say so.

292
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:23,428
I'm back.

293
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:24,988
Yes.

294
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:29,264
Director, what happened to this space?

295
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,702
Oh! We freed up Ji Sun's space.

296
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,613
Oh, you shouldn't have...

297
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,029
What?

298
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,958
Nothing.

299
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:55,262
Shall we go to the internet cafe?

300
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:56,456
I have to go for training.

301
00:20:56,593 --> 00:21:00,422
Hey! What if you really make it to America?

302
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,649
House rentals are so expensive!

303
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,080
Why are you suddenly looking for a house?

304
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:07,741
Without one, I can't get married.

305
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,375
Are you crazy?

306
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:10,994
Noona!

307
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:14,069
You're really going to live with that ahjumma?

308
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:18,576
It's nothing. Don't forget the training time.

309
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
Yes, see you tonight.

310
00:21:21,456 --> 00:21:24,620
Oh it's alright. It's just a simple interview.

311
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,269
Yes.

312
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,052
Yes, me too.

313
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,909
Yes.

314
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,740
Where did she go?

315
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:42,641
Nam Jung!

316
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,355
You're dead if you talk like that again.

317
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,536
Are you going to get married?

318
00:21:57,769 --> 00:21:58,942
No.

319
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:01,716
Then why are you looking at this?

320
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:07,244
Manager Hong, don't bother whether
others are getting married or not,

321
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:10,267
Just marry yourself off first.

322
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,224
Tell me.

323
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:13,134
You're hiding something from me, right?

324
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:18,079
Author Lee Kyung Ha says she
needed material so I looked for it.

325
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:21,521
Is that so?

326
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,389
Oh, nerd!

327
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,877
Before I get to anything like her state,
I'd better marry myself off.

328
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,016
Make her fall down!

329
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:33,437
Fall down! Fall down!

330
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,688
Make me younger by three years! Seven years!

331
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:44,705
No, just five years will do.

332
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:19,941
First, cancel that for me.

333
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:22,470
I'm already begging you like this.

334
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:28,382
I told you I already paid my wife's portion,
why can't she use it still?

335
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:30,752
Oh, really!

336
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:35,868
Customer, this is a family card
so there's nothing we can do.

337
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,461
First, you have to pay up
the interests that you owe...

338
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:42,290
What?

339
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,445
Customer.

340
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:52,414
Our phone conversation now is being recorded.

341
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:54,852
No...

342
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,964
I'm not threatening you.

343
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:02,527
Are you going to keep scolding me like this?

344
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,638
Yes, can't I scold you?

345
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,302
Now my wife and children
have no money to spend.

346
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:11,312
So, customer.

347
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,948
You're already blacklisted for bad credit.

348
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:15,704
I think we informed you about this earlier.

349
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,609
Don't bother whether I'm blacklisted or not,

350
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:21,522
Just activate my wife's card first.
Haven't I already paid up for that card?

351
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,481
I told you we can't do that.

352
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,357
What's this? A computer's automatic reply?

353
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,886
Are you human?

354
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,273
Stop saying the same thing over and over,

355
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,728
I need you to tell me a solution.

356
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,382
That's what I'm doing.

357
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:38,383
If you don't pay up, there's nothing we can do.

358
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:41,284
Maybe my colleague will hunt you down.

359
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,918
Is that alright for you too?

360
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,313
What?

361
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:47,840
You're a real thug now, huh?

362
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,239
Fine. Just come if you want.
Who's afraid?

363
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,653
The one guiding you on the phone so far
is L-card's Kim Chun Hee.

364
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,225
Oh!

365
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,865
- Oh! I'm so mad!
- Unni, what's wrong?

366
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:01,851
What's the use of him losing his temper at me?

367
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:05,295
<i>Yesterday he asked me to activate his wife's card too.</i>

368
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:08,488
<i>Clearly, his wife is having an affair.</i>

369
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,625
<i>I think so too.</i>

370
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,867
<i>Looking at the expense items...</i>

371
00:25:13,018 --> 00:25:15,756
<i>Hotels, restaurants.</i>

372
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,332
Where is Director Im off to again?

373
00:25:26,582 --> 00:25:28,926
He was around just now.

374
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:32,775
Pull out the wires of this computer.

375
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:36,897
This thing is the biggest waste of electricity.

376
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,827
I can't sack the person but I can't put up
with his extravagance also.

377
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,177
Nan Hee.

378
00:25:43,464 --> 00:25:44,241
Yes?

379
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:46,602
Can you go out with me for a while?

380
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:48,386
Yes.

381
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:51,508
I'm the only one to enjoy this treat?

382
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:54,271
Do you find meaning in your work now?

383
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:58,312
I used to write novels in the past too.

384
00:25:58,455 --> 00:25:59,832
You did?

385
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:06,510
Ten years from now you'll be just like me,
chatting with your employee.

386
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:09,298
I could tell very easily.

387
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:12,614
Why?

388
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:14,869
Are you feeling melancholic?

389
00:26:15,814 --> 00:26:20,563
When did you start feeling proud
of your job as an editor?

390
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:25,599
Come talk to me when you have that same pride.

391
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:27,487
I'll tell you then.

392
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,082
You'll tell me as we're drinking wine?

393
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:30,742
Just don't sprawl yourself and cry at that time.

394
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,694
You did that?

395
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:35,547
You wait and see.

396
00:26:36,747 --> 00:26:39,042
Why are you just eating cucumbers?

397
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:41,485
Here. Eat this. This. Here.

398
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,606
This is golden not yellow!

399
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,449
I failed to find a sponsor.

400
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:49,367
Gosh! What will you do?

401
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:50,258
What else?

402
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:53,611
I'll just have to publish a good book
to build my house.

403
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:56,617
Till that day comes, I want
to work hard to keep going on.

404
00:26:56,842 --> 00:26:58,786
So eat a lot more.

405
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:02,552
Didn't you say you're going
to see author Shin Joo Young?

406
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:04,748
I was just saying...

407
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,886
Why do I feel like I was being led by the nose?

408
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,107
Oh no! And there are flies in here too...

409
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:12,507
Oh yes! Would you like some abalone?

410
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:16,131
This is yellow, I thought it was golden. Eat up.

411
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,549
You said you wrote novels,
that must be a lie too.

412
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:25,977
With such beautiful skin,
there's no need for makeup.

413
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,685
If you don't start taking care from
ten years old onwards, it'll become ugly.

414
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:30,519
Really?

415
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:32,883
Is that why she looks like this?

416
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,578
Well...

417
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:40,964
Today we're going to meet
player Kim Jung Joo, right?

418
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:43,916
Actually...

419
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:48,084
He's my boyfriend.

420
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,532
Is that so?

421
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:53,675
Yes.

422
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:58,175
Anyway, you were going to find out so...

423
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:06,374
<i>What's this?</i>

424
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:09,192
<i>That disturbing smirk...</i>

425
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:13,248
What's your favorite food?

426
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:15,743
Um... why are you asking that?

427
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,149
It's for my writing.

428
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:25,034
Oh, I like everything.

429
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:27,526
I like snacks,

430
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:30,548
The lunch box that noona packed for me
the last time was delicious too.

431
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:33,221
What are your hobbies?

432
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:35,119
Wait, let me go to the toilet.

433
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:35,997
Alright.

434
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,794
Ah! Could it be...

435
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:41,369
You like green?

436
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:43,768
Yes. How did you find out?

437
00:28:44,078 --> 00:28:45,819
I think I heard it from somewhere.

438
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:49,196
Jung Joo, go on to the toilet.

439
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:56,574
I say,

440
00:28:56,884 --> 00:29:00,000
It's for character research
that I'm helping you on this,

441
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,715
But, are you doing a personal investigation?

442
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,200
Jung Joo made time for this
in his extremely busy schedule,

443
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:09,596
If you wanted to ask about these,
you should have just asked me.

444
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:13,029
You're seeing Jung Joo just to ask about these?

445
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:15,437
I'm his fan.

446
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:16,403
Fan?

447
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:17,362
Yes.

448
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,258
Player Kim Jung Joo's fan.

449
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:20,952
Is that so?

450
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,238
Fine.

451
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:26,185
Even if you're his fan...

452
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:30,770
No, then why didn't you tell me this earlier?

453
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,613
Not just a simple fan,

454
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:36,319
I love him.

455
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:42,570
When the time comes,
I'm going to tell him myself.

456
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:46,504
If you tell him before that,
I won't forgive you so easily.

457
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:48,667
And if you won't?

458
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:52,124
Since I broke contract a first time,
does it mean there won't be a second time?

459
00:29:52,236 --> 00:29:54,553
I... earned lots of money.

460
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:57,990
Paying the penalty for breaking
contract is nothing to me.

461
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:01,292
But right now, your company
has no financial source.

462
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:03,249
And you'll be in a tough spot
if you don't publish my book.

463
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:06,373
Hey! Do you think a contract is child's play?

464
00:30:06,652 --> 00:30:11,186
If you compare that to my love for oppa,
it can't qualify as child's play.

465
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:15,412
Since senior high till now,

466
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:20,944
Without oppa, my youth
would have been very painful.

467
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,903
How do I get close to him?

468
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:27,029
I thought about that for five years.

469
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,094
But,

470
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,951
You found out he's my boyfriend.

471
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:33,735
That's destiny, right?

472
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:35,639
How can my boyfriend be your destiny?

473
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,960
Oh, see how you say my boyfriend,
you seem to feel threatened.

474
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:41,689
Ah! Really! This is ridiculous.

475
00:30:42,086 --> 00:30:45,607
If only he dumped you,
all matters will be resolved.

476
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:49,339
I'm putting up with you even
though I'm upset. Stop it now.

477
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,620
I don't feel like talking to you.

478
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:57,175
Anyhow, I won't bother about this.
Just write your book well.

479
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:02,019
Miss Hong Nan Hee, you're older
than him by eight years, right?

480
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:07,578
What kind of ending will
this relationship have?

481
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:10,991
I know.

482
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:13,935
So this is where it stops.

483
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,215
That guy...

484
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:17,729
Must...

485
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,431
Become my all.

486
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:34,112
Noona, you should keep your hair long
like hers, it's so beautiful.

487
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,542
Ah!

488
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:41,999
Oppa, please give me your phone number.

489
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,715
If I have questions, I can call you, right?

490
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:47,554
Sure.

491
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,341
Why are you on a strike?

492
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,631
The deadline is the day after tomorrow.

493
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:03,730
Do you ever read the newspaper?

494
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:06,830
Why? Did something happen?

495
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:09,146
Um...

496
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:10,700
Yeah?

497
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:12,265
He's getting married.

498
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,429
So what?

499
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:18,070
It's a serious situation.
It's an accident.

500
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:21,196
I wouldn't care if it was
Jang Dong Gun or Jung Woo Sung.

501
00:32:21,284 --> 00:32:26,892
They have their own lives, I know that.

502
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:34,345
But even if he wasn't mine,
he seemed as though he was mine.

503
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,434
What am I going to do
about this feeling of loss.

504
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,213
Turn on the music.

505
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:47,146
Okay. Listen to music and become energized.

506
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,169
What do you want?

507
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:53,621
<i>Why did you</i>

508
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:57,419
<i>Have to leave me</i>

509
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,212
Was that JK Kim Dong Wook?

510
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,166
Lee Yoon Ah.

511
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:05,194
B*tch? (bitch in Korean is Lee Nyun,
so she heard that instead of Lee Yoon Ah)

512
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,019
Did you just insult me?

513
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:08,601
You don't know Lee Yoon Ah?

514
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:10,576
I don't know.

515
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:14,271
I miss Nan Hee.

516
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:17,130
Why are you acting like that again!

517
00:33:17,308 --> 00:33:22,170
How can I work with someone who doesn't know
the difference between hunger and an empty stomach?

518
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,747
I'm so mad.

519
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:24,910
Nan Hee!

520
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:26,748
Manager Hong!

521
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:28,850
Yoo Suk* is getting married.
(*short for Yoo Jae Seok - a Korean entertainer)

522
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:30,853
I know.

523
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:33,020
What is this?

524
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:35,689
That's not the problem!

525
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:37,278
What kind of person is that?

526
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,993
I'm stressed out enough as of now already.

527
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:45,479
Of course you need to have
a match with her. He's your guy.

528
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:47,530
That would be even funnier.

529
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:53,765
But the weird thing is that the more
I talk with her, I keep falling low with her.

530
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,032
And I feel like I'm floundering in the mud.

531
00:33:58,174 --> 00:33:59,683
She looked really naive.

532
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,515
She's just pretending.
She's a total psycho!

533
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:03,700
Is she pretty?

534
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:05,014
She's pretty.

535
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:08,696
Her skin is really smooth and looks really nice.

536
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:10,237
If Manager Hong's words are true...

537
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:11,476
They're true.

538
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,727
I want to videotape her real side.

539
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:18,198
If that's true, then she's strategically attacking you.

540
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,210
Those kinds of girls are really scary.

541
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:22,628
That happened to me before also.

542
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:24,556
That happened to you also?

543
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:26,887
About 12 years ago.

544
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,346
Or is it 11?

545
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,642
Well... she's just a child.

546
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:34,232
A child? She's going to be a college student soon.

547
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:41,895
If you see it as a big picture,
she's on a side and you're on the other side.

548
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,694
Wow, you must be really nervous.

549
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,530
What do you mean nervous?

550
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,622
Do I not know Jung Joo?
You saw Jung Joo.

551
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,586
Would Jung Joo be moved or something?

552
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:54,943
Nooo.

553
00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:57,148
No?

554
00:34:57,585 --> 00:35:00,618
I feel so bad.

555
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:02,266
I can't take it anymore.

556
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:03,971
Why?

557
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,975
What?

558
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,710
You can't be like this right now.

559
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:11,733
You need to take care of yourself.
You're going to lose him if you stay still.

560
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,490
What are they?

561
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,563
Dong Hap Makeup Set.
Have it.

562
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,454
- What?
- It's new.

563
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:22,537
Dong Hap Makeup Set?

564
00:35:23,564 --> 00:35:27,216
The makeup name is really heartrending.

565
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:41,969
What am I doing?

566
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,366
Mom, what?

567
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,492
You came?

568
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:07,205
I'm coming here too often these days.

569
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:10,146
I know. It must be really hard for you.

570
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,687
Aren't you embarrassed?

571
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:14,455
There's a limit.

572
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:15,617
How can...

573
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:19,276
When he's standing next to you,
he looks like your nephew.

574
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:21,382
You probably don't know because
you're out of your mind,

575
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:23,857
but it looks like that to everyone else.

576
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:27,619
I would enjoy watching that kind
of situation on a drama,

577
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,765
but I can't let my child be like that.

578
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,699
What in the world...

579
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:37,542
Are you really planning to get married with
a student who didn't go to the army yet?

580
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:41,052
And what's wrong with him?
Being caught by you?

581
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:46,014
After you get married, what if he
becomes attracted to girls?

582
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:49,898
Don't regret it then.
Please listen to me.

583
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:54,175
People don't match others
depending on age for no reason.

584
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:57,370
Why aren't you saying anything?!

585
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:59,850
<i>Honestly, I didn't have anything to say.</i>

586
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:01,665
<i>Mom was right.</i>

587
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:04,179
<i>I know everything too.</i>

588
00:37:04,385 --> 00:37:08,311
You waiting for him is crazy too.

589
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,353
He seemed far from being
able to support a family.

590
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:11,673
An athlete?

591
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,506
He might not be able to do
that for the rest of his life.

592
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,017
I heard he's out of his mind like you and said
he's going to play baseball in America?

593
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:22,007
Even if he does succeed,
he's not going to anytime soon.

594
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,653
Unni.

595
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,565
You left this.

596
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,002
<i>You bought those kinds of stuff.</i>

597
00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:41,338
<i>You're trying so hard.</i>

598
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:43,935
<i>Do whatever you want.</i>

599
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:47,079
Bye.

600
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:59,886
<i>Love makes me uneasy
but I have no courage to break up.</i>

601
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:05,081
<i>When I think about our future, I become scared.</i>

602
00:38:05,357 --> 00:38:07,290
<i>Choose one from the things I'm going to say.</i>

603
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:11,582
<i>Jung Joo, give me some strength.</i>

604
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:13,024
Okay, say them.

605
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:15,853
<i>Excited Nolboo*.
(*character from a book called "Heung Bu Jeon")</i>

606
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:18,806
<i>Already undressed king.</i>

607
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,627
<i>Give me your trust.
So that my love won't be so uneasy.</i>

608
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:27,898
<i>Give me something that
I can hold onto tightly, Jung Joo.</i>

609
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,760
Night when you can't fall asleep.

610
00:38:29,981 --> 00:38:31,403
After you take your pants off.

611
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,379
Elder brother with a mouth infection.

612
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,903
What do you like?

613
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:37,701
What is that?

614
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:40,372
I want to use one of them
on my cell phone screen.

615
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,715
<i>I'm about to get tired.</i>

616
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:47,692
No, why are you doing that?

617
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,730
<i>It's fun.</i>

618
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:53,159
<i>Each day seems like a hill.</i>

619
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,437
Noona, there's a quote from Babe Ruth here.

620
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,201
How about this?

621
00:38:58,392 --> 00:39:05,361
When you start to feel that every base line
feels like a hill, you must quit baseball.

622
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:08,046
Isn't that really awesome?

623
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:09,696
<i>Should I use that?</i>

624
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,387
<i>But is it too long?</i>

625
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,932
<i>How many letters can I use?</i>

626
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:16,478
<i>Babe Ruth is a batter.</i>

627
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,882
<i>I'm a batter too.</i>

628
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,570
<i>What should I do?</i>

629
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:34,942
Excuse me!
Mister from apartment number 705!

630
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:37,196
Oh, hello.

631
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,645
Why? Do you have a girl?

632
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:44,039
I don't want to marry yet.

633
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:47,546
I would feel bad for the partner
if I go on a blind date like this.

634
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,292
No. Meet her.

635
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,700
I feel like this one will work.

636
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:56,208
89% of the matches I made worked.

637
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,366
She's 28 years old.

638
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,361
I heard you're 30.

639
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:02,425
This kind of age difference is good these days.

640
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:06,792
She's from a publishing company, Jang Comics.

641
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:07,642
What?

642
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:09,138
You know that?

643
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:11,856
I heard it's a pretty big company.

644
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:16,220
It's a lady from that company
named Hong Nan Hee.

645
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:21,934
If you're hesitant, do you want a picture of her?

646
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:23,781
Do you want to do it after you see it?

647
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:26,730
No, I'll just go on a blind date.

648
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:28,342
Really?

649
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:31,660
Hold on, let me call her.

650
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:34,718
Oh yeah, do you work?

651
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,099
Oh, I'm an Antique Appraiser.

652
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,583
You came?

653
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:54,260
What are you doing?

654
00:40:55,426 --> 00:40:58,557
This lifts your face skin.

655
00:40:58,705 --> 00:40:59,940
Are you drunk?

656
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:01,816
Do you want to join me?

657
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:07,951
You shouldn't be doing this right now.

658
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,952
That's what everyone is telling me these days.

659
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,749
Nan Hee, you shouldn't be doing this right now.

660
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:18,574
Do you know who the ahjumma from apartment
number 605 told me to go on a blind date with?

661
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:20,389
I don't know.

662
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,551
Is it Hyun Bo Ram?

663
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,481
What are you doing?

664
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,389
It's you... Ms. Hong, Ms. Hong!

665
00:41:31,546 --> 00:41:32,796
Me?!

666
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:35,063
Yes, you!

667
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:38,064
[August 10th, Montmatre, Antique Appraiser: Choi Jin Sung]

668
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:40,521
Oh, okay.

669
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:42,317
Okay.

670
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:56,857
I'm really suspicious.

671
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,282
She's really happy?

672
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:02,926
She said thank you for changing my mind.

673
00:42:03,443 --> 00:42:05,074
That ahjumma.

674
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,625
Hey, hey, hey.

675
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,755
What should I do now?

676
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:13,934
If mom comes here often and she sees
the ahjumma from downstairs.

677
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,988
I'm really confused.

678
00:42:17,383 --> 00:42:22,006
I think I'm going to die because I get nervous
and my heart thumps because of you.

679
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:25,191
Should we just move?

680
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:27,697
Does that make sense?

681
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,950
I have to hurry up and save money to move out.

682
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:40,560
Hey, you're quick at making up your profile.

683
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,860
Antique Appraiser, Choi Jin Sung?

684
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:45,935
How is it?
You're attracted, huh?

685
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:51,808
You're definitely different since
you have fooled many girls before.

686
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:54,666
I heard you were 28 years old?

687
00:42:54,797 --> 00:42:56,603
And I heard you were really pretty?

688
00:42:56,755 --> 00:42:58,658
My mom said that?

689
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,949
I can't stop her.

690
00:43:01,226 --> 00:43:03,121
Where's Montmatre?

691
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,082
It seems like a French restaurant.

692
00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:06,765
You've never been there before?

693
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,887
Why would I go to that kind of a place?

694
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:18,050
This is the best profile I've ever seen.

695
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:20,284
A good job.

696
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:22,568
And a tall height.

697
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,153
And the same age.

698
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:29,379
And has a good choice about location.

699
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:33,844
What if we didn't know each other?

700
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:39,510
If I didn't know about you and went to meet you,
what would've happened to us?

701
00:43:39,722 --> 00:43:42,378
You would've been attracted to me.

702
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:44,287
It would be bothersome.

703
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:46,391
August 10th?

704
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:48,470
- Huh?
- That day!

705
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:51,225
Say it first.

706
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,233
It's the neighborhood meeting that day.

707
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,048
What?

708
00:43:58,164 --> 00:44:00,341
I went last time.

709
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:01,897
Are you stupid?

710
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:05,763
Oh, yeah. I need to go.

711
00:44:05,764 --> 00:44:06,764
How about you?

712
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:08,550
Didn't you say you have something that day too?

713
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:11,741
I was going to tell you not to forget
and call your mom that day.

714
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:14,195
You need to lie that you at least met the guy.

715
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:16,254
I should write it down.

716
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:19,456
You smell like alcohol.
Go wash up.

717
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:21,894
- Do I smell?
- Yes.

718
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:24,773
I'll go brush my teeth.

719
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,614
I was going to feed her oily food.

720
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,926
Whatever!

721
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:49,193
I like that song.

722
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:33,773
If I leave this house,
I'm going to miss that sound.

723
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:42,447
One!

724
00:45:42,693 --> 00:45:43,525
Two!

725
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:44,481
Three!

726
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:45,417
Four!

727
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:46,438
One!

728
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:47,659
Two!

729
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:48,775
Three!

730
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:50,103
Four!

731
00:45:50,392 --> 00:45:51,931
Five!

732
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:53,396
Huh? Joo Young!

733
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:55,229
Continue practicing, I won't bother you.

734
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:56,185
What are you doing here?

735
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:59,398
I just stopped by on the way to school.
I wanted to see you practicing.

736
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:02,074
- Do these kinds of things help?
- Of course!

737
00:46:02,214 --> 00:46:05,841
When your actions come into my eyes,
they all become words.

738
00:46:06,654 --> 00:46:08,081
These kinds of things also?

739
00:46:08,275 --> 00:46:09,543
These too?

740
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,928
These help too?

741
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,274
Oh yeah, oppa.
Don't tell Manager Hong that I came here, okay?

742
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:17,260
Why?

743
00:46:17,413 --> 00:46:20,170
I'm going to get yelled at for ruining your practice.

744
00:46:21,106 --> 00:46:21,780
Okay.

745
00:46:21,963 --> 00:46:25,364
But you have to write an awesome book, okay?
So that Nan Hee will be happy.

746
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:27,565
Okay. Look forward to it!

747
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:32,270
But oppa, can I hit one of the balls you throw?

748
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,019
No, it's dangerous, you're going to get hurt.

749
00:46:34,197 --> 00:46:35,976
- Just once.
- It's dangerous.

750
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:38,117
- Just once.
- Just once?

751
00:46:38,313 --> 00:46:39,246
Just once.

752
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:50,128
You're connecting the two together?

753
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,872
It's too empty.

754
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:57,662
The office feels empty now that Ji Sun isn't here.

755
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:01,759
Shall I clean my desk also?

756
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,593
<i>It looks like someone who needs love.</i>

757
00:47:25,546 --> 00:47:27,969
<i>It looks like that to me also.</i>

758
00:47:32,264 --> 00:47:34,510
What ambition do you see in me?

759
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:44,361
Wow, that's amazing.

760
00:47:44,576 --> 00:47:47,288
You're good.
Once more. Here...

761
00:47:48,046 --> 00:47:50,140
You're really good.

762
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:01,395
Propose?

763
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:02,713
Yeah.

764
00:48:03,043 --> 00:48:09,263
If I pass this test, I'm going to
officially propose... to noona.

765
00:48:17,535 --> 00:48:18,816
You packed everything, right?

766
00:48:19,078 --> 00:48:19,880
Yes.

767
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:23,454
My condition is perfect.
I have 100% energy.

768
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:25,088
It's time.

769
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:27,027
Go now.

770
00:48:29,933 --> 00:48:32,093
Do well there.

771
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:34,186
Okay.

772
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:36,893
Kiss me.

773
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:39,061
Here?

774
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:56,106
Okay, I will.

775
00:49:09,192 --> 00:49:11,404
You tried your best, didn't you?

776
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,078
Yes.

777
00:49:23,765 --> 00:49:25,282
Do well.

778
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:27,459
I'll wait for you.

779
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:29,849
Oppa!

780
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:32,599
You came?

781
00:49:32,626 --> 00:49:33,765
Hey!

782
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:34,846
What are you?

783
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:38,048
She said she'll go with me because
she wants to know the testing process.

784
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,048
Stay here.

785
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,784
Are you crazy?

786
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:46,765
Calm down.

787
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,546
Do you think he looks like
he's going there to play?

788
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:51,637
This vacation seems like my chance to me.

789
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:52,825
Vacation?

790
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:55,187
His life is dependent on this.

791
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,642
My life depends on this too.

792
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,674
Can you not go?

793
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:03,571
This is a really important test for him.

794
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:06,957
He prepared really hard for today.

795
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:08,979
This...

796
00:50:09,265 --> 00:50:12,594
This might be his last chance, Joo Young.

797
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:13,927
Oh?

798
00:50:14,049 --> 00:50:15,862
Please.

799
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:19,839
It's time for the plane.
I'm going.

800
00:50:21,962 --> 00:50:23,723
Okay.

801
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:27,235
You're telling me that you're
going to go no matter what?

802
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:29,775
Okay.

803
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:32,558
Then I'll ask you a favor.

804
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,706
Please don't bother him when he's testing.

805
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:38,563
You can do whatever you want
the rest of the time.

806
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:42,497
But, please make sure he doesn't lose his focus.

807
00:50:42,632 --> 00:50:45,425
And that his condition doesn't worsen, okay?

808
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,117
Okay.

809
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,326
Oppa!

810
00:51:10,382 --> 00:51:13,163
How about we move this to here?

811
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:16,795
Hey, Byun Hyung Tae.

812
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:17,688
Come out.

813
00:51:17,878 --> 00:51:18,489
Why?

814
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,466
Hurry up!

815
00:51:23,738 --> 00:51:24,908
What again?

816
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,297
I need a tentative plan for an advertisement.

817
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:27,769
I'm in meeting right now.

818
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,614
Why are you complaining so much?

819
00:51:31,342 --> 00:51:32,797
We need to go film tomorrow!

820
00:51:32,953 --> 00:51:33,842
It won't take much time.

821
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:36,344
Five minutes. Exactly five minutes!

822
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,311
You're going to take it.
Please help me!

823
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:42,653
The women's restroom?

824
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:44,025
Hurry up.

825
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:47,995
What are you going to do?

826
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,876
Take it.

827
00:51:54,983 --> 00:51:56,137
Did you pay her?

828
00:51:56,298 --> 00:51:57,466
Or you're going to sell this
after secretly taking it?

829
00:51:57,558 --> 00:52:00,183
It's an ad for constipation pills.
Just take pictures, I'll be right back.

830
00:52:01,624 --> 00:52:04,090
How can you do this to me!

831
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:31,717
Um... tt tells me to do this.

832
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:43,720
Um... can you take off your shoes?

833
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:58,772
Um... your stockings also.

834
00:53:04,299 --> 00:53:07,128
Can you follow the script please?

835
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:16,142
You…

836
00:53:16,395 --> 00:53:18,740
Are Ji Sun, right?

837
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:22,494
How did you know?

838
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:30,795
- You're working already?
- Yes.

839
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:35,535
I heard you like girls with pretty ankles?

840
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:37,304
Who said that?

841
00:53:37,502 --> 00:53:39,483
Nan Hee unni.

842
00:53:40,277 --> 00:53:43,317
She tells people weird things.

843
00:53:52,398 --> 00:53:54,316
Sunbae.

844
00:53:56,081 --> 00:54:01,491
Am I really not the one for you?

845
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:12,287
You look like you need love too.

846
00:54:35,322 --> 00:54:36,722
[Hyung Tae]

847
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:43,365
Yes?

848
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,182
You're not answering the phone quickly.

849
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:46,440
Are you not nervous anymore?

850
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:48,359
I think I left it in the bathroom
after taking a bath.

851
00:54:48,572 --> 00:54:50,866
Of course you would do that.

852
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:53,749
What do you think happened, Hyung Tae?

853
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:56,673
It's already been two days since
the day he was supposed to come.

854
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:58,475
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

855
00:54:58,616 --> 00:55:00,649
I don't care whether you're hungry or not.

856
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:03,780
It would be miserable if I eat alone.

857
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,546
<i>Then come home.</i>

858
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:07,185
Today is the 10th.

859
00:55:07,252 --> 00:55:10,045
So what?
Oh yeah!

860
00:55:10,117 --> 00:55:12,339
<i>You're responsible for it!</i>

861
00:55:20,346 --> 00:55:25,232
If you're going to have a hard time just
because of that little kid, stop it, you idiot.

862
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:27,347
Who said I was?

863
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:31,285
I'm just worried that he would have failed
the test because of that mean girl.

864
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:32,522
You said you told her...

865
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,860
That she could do whatever
she wants the rest of the time.

866
00:55:35,034 --> 00:55:39,336
Maybe he passed the test and they're planning
on coming after going on a short vacation.

867
00:55:41,308 --> 00:55:43,961
Can you imagine it?

868
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:51,596
In my head, the two of them are jumping
into the fresh California water.

869
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:54,522
Hey!

870
00:55:55,382 --> 00:56:00,676
Do you think I'm going to forgive you for thinking
about someone else on a blind date with me?

871
00:56:00,939 --> 00:56:02,267
Okay.

872
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,314
Let's rest for a bit.

873
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:08,409
My head and my heart need some rest.

874
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,224
Eat and sleep well today.

875
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:17,263
And see the brilliant sun tomorrow.

876
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:20,220
Is the sun really bright?

877
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:23,384
Eat.

878
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:36,164
What is this?
It's cold.

879
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:38,192
The summer menu here is excellent.

880
00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:40,503
It tastes...

881
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,678
It has a very elegant taste to it.

882
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:46,148
- You like it, don't you?
- Yes.

883
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:51,046
Let's act like adults today.

884
00:56:51,518 --> 00:56:54,125
Talk face to face with an adult.

885
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,466
Hey.

886
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:23,018
It was funny the last time I went to your company.

887
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:28,512
But when I see you outside of the house,
you seem unfamiliar.

888
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,220
Is it because you're wearing a suit?

889
00:57:32,177 --> 00:57:34,353
My suit is a bit sexy, isn't it?

890
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,891
It's different from the sexiness
you get when you're young.

891
00:57:37,027 --> 00:57:41,528
It gives off a feeling of calmness?

892
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,150
How is this?
You're out of breath, aren't you?

893
00:57:55,689 --> 00:57:57,708
Should I allure you today?

894
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:01,237
Would simply taking your tie off work?

895
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:03,602
Restroom.

896
00:58:12,282 --> 00:58:14,102
What is this?

897
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:39,511
Why?

898
00:58:42,965 --> 00:58:45,341
The light is wonderful.

899
00:58:45,513 --> 00:58:47,419
It was a good buy.

900
00:58:47,754 --> 00:58:50,988
My heart becomes warm.

901
00:58:51,162 --> 00:58:53,692
I think I'll be able to write well.

902
00:58:53,802 --> 00:58:56,711
Thank you.

903
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:01,175
A person's heart is very wicked.

904
00:59:02,895 --> 00:59:12,252
I was frustrated and nervous as though the world
was dark for ten days ever since Jung Joo left.

905
00:59:13,537 --> 00:59:17,591
Do you know what I thought when we were eating?

906
00:59:20,384 --> 00:59:26,520
This kind of date is better than a date where
you eat spicy rice cake and ramen.

907
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:28,163
Yes.

908
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:32,013
I want to do these kinds of things at times.

909
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:37,643
Not a boyfriend whom I have to give allowance to.

910
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:43,616
I want to receive a gift sometimes too.

911
00:59:43,843 --> 00:59:48,028
But it's not like I'm expecting
something from a famous brand.

912
00:59:48,303 --> 00:59:54,005
To say the least, I do not want
to be in a relationship,

913
00:59:55,906 --> 01:00:00,006
where I would have to struggle
with counting coins in my wallet.

914
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:03,946
I'm quite a snob, huh?

915
01:00:05,087 --> 01:00:11,320
You're going to happily eat spicy rice cake
and ramen when he comes back anyways.

916
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,532
I don't know.

917
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,890
If my mood was like today's,

918
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:22,306
if I really went on a blind date with
an Antique Appraiser named Choi Jin Sung,

919
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:26,834
I would have fell in love with him.

920
01:00:30,736 --> 01:00:35,258
Do you want to come to me,
thinking that I'm Choi Jin Sung?

921
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:41,354
Your service is a bit too much today.

922
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:44,725
Hello?

923
01:01:25,162 --> 01:01:26,886
You came.

924
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:29,576
I came here immediately from the airport.

925
01:01:30,115 --> 01:01:31,156
Okay.

926
01:01:31,393 --> 01:01:35,323
Sorry for not calling you.
There was a problem.

927
01:01:38,373 --> 01:01:39,590
It's okay.

928
01:01:39,706 --> 01:01:41,113
Did you eat?

929
01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:42,374
Let's go inside.

930
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:44,122
No, it's okay.

931
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:48,149
I'll tell you right here.

932
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,456
Noona.

933
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:57,266
Let's get married.

934
01:01:58,676 --> 01:01:59,633
What?
