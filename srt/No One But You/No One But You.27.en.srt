I'll have people distract them.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,300
Qinghuan,

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,740
you get the car ready here.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,860
Once we're out,

to the lackeys.

You're a stain on the nation!

00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,860
You're no revolutionary.

74
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,260

75
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,460
You can't stay loyal to one

77
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,940

After you die,

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,820
how are you going to protect her?

92
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,380
My death will be worth nothing.

93
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,460
But if I'm alive,

94
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,620
I can help you remove

95
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,740
the thorns in your side.

96
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,740
Why would I believe you?

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,060
You'll get my proof soon.

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,020

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,020
Jiang Mohan,

you will get what you deserve.

101
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,260
Marshal,

102
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,860
all the people inside are dead.

103
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,900
Chu Yunfan
and the Sparks Society leader Anning,

104
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,660
were killed
by the Military Governor himself.

105
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,500
Okay.

106
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,540
Guzhou is something.

107
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,980
Only you

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,860
could find where the rebels were

109
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,260
and take them all down.

110
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,060
Mohan.

111
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,700
I waited at the rendezvous for long.

112
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,940
but Fan and others never showed up.

113
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,140
What happened?

114
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,380
The mission was successful.

115
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,740
But when we retreated,

116
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,140
we had a situation,

117
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,540
and they had to retreat by water.

118
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,540
What situation?

119
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,060
There are eyes and ears in the mansion.

120
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,260
I'll explain to you later.

121
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,540
No matter what happens,

122
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,260
you have to believe

123
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,860
I did everything for you.

124
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,380
Let's go.

125
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,980
Where are you going, Miss Yu?

126
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,460
To find out what happened
to Chu Yunfan and the Sparks Society,

127
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,380
start with these.

128
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,060
They're all dead.

129
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,660
It was Jiang Mohan,

130
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,820
oh, no,

131
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Guzhou, more accurately,

132
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,020
who killed them by himself.

133
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,300
Impossible.

134
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,780
How could he betray the Society?

135
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,260
Why would he do that?

136
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,020
Why did he do this to me?

137
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,700
Since you're so smart,

138
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,060
why don't you think about it?

139
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,660
Without Jiang Mohan's betrayal,

140
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,500
we wouldn't have taken you down
so easily.

141
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,980
He

142
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,940
totally manipulated you,

143
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,060
yet you thought you had true love.

144
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,620
All of this

145
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,780
is nothing but a ridiculous joke.

146
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,220
Yu Qinghuan,

147
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,740
I bet you didn't see this coming.

148
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,580
Qinghuan.

149
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,980
You betrayed the Society

150
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,820
and killed Fan and other comrades.

151
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,020
You must have a reason, right?

152
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,980
Tell me.

153
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,420
Tell me.

154
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,980
Talk.

155
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,820
Tell me this isn't true!

156
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,180
My reason is you.

157
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,620
Me?

158
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,940
The Marshal and Chihoko
wanted to kill you.

159
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,900
I've been an undercover agent
for ten years,

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,900
and if I can't protect my beloved woman,

161
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,900
what am I even fighting for?

162
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,980
What's the point?

163
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,780
So you're willing

164
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,420
to live like a rat in the gutter.

165
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,460
Qingqiu,

166
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Fan,

167
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,860
Anning,

168
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,420
what were they after?

169
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,260
What were they willing to die for?

170
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,540
And why did I do all this?

171
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,700
You've made all their efforts worthless.

172
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,660
When you die,

173
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,220
how can you face them in the underworld?

174
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,620
Tell me,

175
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,100
how can you face them?

176
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,260
I want to spend my life with you.

177
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
I want to keep you by my side.

178
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,340
Even if I had to betray the world,

179
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,740
do everyone wrong,

180
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,660
and get scorned by tens of thousands,

181
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,180
I would do it.

182
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,580
Don't touch me.

183
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,940
You disgust me.

184
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,100
Let me go.

185
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Don't touch me.

186
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,580
Don't touch me.

187
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,700
I did all this for you.

188
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,740
For me?

189
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,100
You did it

190
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,580
for your filthy ambition.

191
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,140
Time will heal everything.

192
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,540
We can start all over again.

193
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,180
Qinghuan,

194
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,980
you love me,

195
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,180
right?

196
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,660
I trusted you

197
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,620
and loved you,

198
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,380
but you betrayed and failed me.

199
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,660
I hate you, but I hate myself more.

200
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,340
Why would I fall in love

201
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,980
with someone as despicable as you?

202
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,940
Don't move.

203
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,340
You know what killing her would mean.

204
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,980
Get Yu Qinghuan no matter where she is!

205
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,100
Don't hurt her.

206
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,060
I know where to find her.

207
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,900
It's here.

208
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,020
Only you can find her.

209
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,860
I'm not sure if I should marvel

210
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,460
at how connected you were

211
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,780
or lament that you've parted ways.

212
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,020
Go.

213
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,460
Please hold.

214
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,900
Let me go myself.

215
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,940
Please don't follow me.

216
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,420
I promise I will bring her out.

217
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,380
Okay.

218
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,300
We'll wait for your good news.

219
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,860
Qinghuan.

220
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,020
I'm here.

221
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,300
Qinghuan,

222
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,460
we got married here

223
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,740
and promise to stay together forever.

224
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,860
I made a big mistake,

225
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,980
but I don't regret it.

226
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Let's leave here together, okay?

227
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,980
Dream on.

228
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,660
Do you think we can still go back

229
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,100
after what we've been through?

230
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,980
I know there's no going back.

231
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,420
But we can start over.

232
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,700
Start over?

233
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,260
If we could,

234
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,300
I would never have fallen for you.

235
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,820
You'll stay with me for life.
