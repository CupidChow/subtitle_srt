And for what kind of belief,

188
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,900
was she willing to sacrifice herself?

189
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,020
Qingqiu.

190
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,220
Wait for me.

191
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,460
Qingqiu.

192
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,020
I've finally come home for the holiday,

193
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,100
and you don't even spend time with me.

194
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,740
Be good.

195
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,380
I have something important to handle.

196
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,460
I want you

197
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,940
to have lasting happiness and well-being

198
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,540
and not end up homeless.

199
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,980
So,

200
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,340
I want to follow the path
my sister took,

201
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,940
by joining the Sparks Society.

202
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,980
Her sacrifice must not be in vain.

203
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,780
Comrade Yu Qinghuan,

204
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,180
welcome

205
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,140
to the Sparks Society.

206
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,780
Your codename is Liuan.

207
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,220
This is your first task.

208
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,180
Jiang Muohan is looking for Guzhou.

209
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,300
You need to use him to find Guzhou

210
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,540
and protect him in secret.

211
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,220
