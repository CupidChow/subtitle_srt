14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,140
[Episode 29]

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,500
[I die for my country
without any regret.]

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,980
[This life, I bid you farewell.
Next life, together we'll grow old.]

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,380
You're awake.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,380
Come on.

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,020
Mohan used a specially made bullet

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,940
which wasn't fatal,

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,460
but you're hurt.

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,980
Make sure to heal up.

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,940
Is something wrong?

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,620
Qinghuan,

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
Chihoko and the Marshal

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,180
want you dead.

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,540
I know

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,940
you will never retreat alone.

29
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,460
So,

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,340
there's only one way left for us.

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,060
Faking our death.

32
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,220
We have become

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,340
a huge threat to them.

34
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,660
The munition deal has been delayed.

35
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,820
So,

36
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,260
I will pretend to defect.

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,780
What?

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,780
You're Guzhou?

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,060
I can help you remove

40
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,740
the thorns in your side.

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,500
Guzhou has been compromised.

42
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,500
Fire.

43
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,700
I need you to put up a show with me

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,940
so I can gain their full trust,

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,580
and you can fake your death to escape.

46
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,180
Let's go.

47
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,820
The biggest flaw of this plan is me.

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,220
I know Chihoko.

49
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,500
She hates me to the core.

50
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,700
If she doesn't watch me die,

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,300
she will never stop thinking about it.

52
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,260
Without Jiang Mohan's betrayal,

53
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,140
we wouldn't have taken you down

54
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,140
so easily.

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,460
Why would I fall in love

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,100
with someone as despicable as you?

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,460
Let go!

58
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
Don't be like this.

59
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:10,940
Jiang Mohan!

60
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,380
No!

61
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,980
Don't touch me!

62
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,940
I'm not letting you go.

63
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,460
I am Mohan.

64
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:14,780
I am...

65
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,260
You're not!

66
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Look at me. I am Mohan!

67
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,100
I don't know you.

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,940
You're not!

69
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,900
Who are you?

70
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,220
Jiang Mohan.

71
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,740
I curse you

72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,620
to fall into the deepest abyss

73
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,420
and never escape.

74
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,260
Luckily, we had frogmen on standby

75
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,500
to get you out.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,740
Or it would be hard

77
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,140
for you to get out by yourself.

78
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,060
They're here.

79
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,900
Qinghuan.

80
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,420
Qinghuan!

81
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,620
You don't know how scared I was.

82
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,300
I was so worried the plan would go wrong

83
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,300
and I'd never see you again.

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,860
I understand.

85
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,780
How would I not know?

86
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,660
Luckily, everything went well.

87
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,460
Here I am, perfectly fine.

88
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,140
The munitions have arrived at the port.

89
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,340
We don't have much time.

90
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,780
Please operate based on my plan.

91
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,700
[Transfer Order]

92
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,980
I'm now the Marshal

93
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,060
and can transfer the munitions
with my authority.

94
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,780
Yunfan, Anning, go with me.

95
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,220
Shen Jun.

96
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,900
Assemble!

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,580
Take my guards to the celebration party

98
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,180
and hold back the Marshal and Chihoko

99
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,980
to buy time for the transfer.

100
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,460
Eyes front!

101
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,220
Qinghuan,

102
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,140
stand by at the extraction point

103
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,100
and pick them up.

104
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,260
Let's take the planned route to retreat

105
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,460
and meet
at the Ganzhou Soviet Area.

106
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,540
Thank you for your hard work.

107
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,180
History will remember.

108
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,580
So will the nation and its people.

109
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,820
Wake up.

110
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,860
Where is Qinghuan?

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Tell us.

112
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,500
The Marshal switched defenses

113
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,820
and transferred your guards away.

114
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,780
I came to let you know,

115
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,700
but time was tight,

116
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,980
and Miss Yu

117
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,740
decided to take action herself.

118
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,300
I couldn't stop her,

119
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,460
sir.

120
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,220
Mohan, my husband,

121
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,180
I believe you will understand

122
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,580
my decision,

123
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,100
for you

124
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,660
would make the same choice.

125
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,860
How blessed I've been

126
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,700
to have known you
and felt the warmth of your love.

127
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,620
Yet, what a cruel twist of fate

128
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,260
to be born
in such a tumultuous era of China.

129
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,700
Come on.

130
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,700
Marshal,

131
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,620
good to see you.

132
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,580
Marshal,

133
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,380
we've received

134
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,500
samples of new weapons,

135
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,540
powerful enough to destroy a city.

136
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,060
They're in the car outside...

137
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,820
Marshal!

138
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,260
Marshal, the munitions are gone.

139
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
They say Marshal Jiang transferred them.

140
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,260
Jiang Mohan faked betrayal.

141
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,780
Chase him now!

142
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,940
Yes, sir.

143
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,780
I shall lay down my life for my country

144
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,700
with no regrets whatsoever.

145
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,540
Yet the thought of your sorrow

146
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,660
pierces my heart,

147
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,460
even beyond the grave.

148
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,580
This life, I bid you farewell.

149
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,140
Next life, together we'll gray.

150
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,900
Your wife, Qinghuan.

151
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,460
That's a lot.

152
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,540
I can't drag you into this.

153
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,700
These are all my savings.

154
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,300
Joys of Life

155
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,300

Until next time.

157
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,260
Okay,

158
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,340
you did not die.

159
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,180
What a good show you put up.

160
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,300
You are not going
to transfer the munitions out.
