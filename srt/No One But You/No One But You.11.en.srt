Break in.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,580
Fan, why are you here?

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,780
Tell me the truth.

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,620
I have my reasons.

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,300
You only need to know

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,500
I will never hurt you.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,780
This is urgent.

22
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,460
Come with me.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,540
My people are outside.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,060
Let's go.

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,060
Wait a moment.

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,020
I know Jiang Mohan well.

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,420
He must have got eyes outside.

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,420
I've got everything ready.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,020
Follow me.

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,700
Okay.

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,460
Let's go down and swim out of here.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,460
Okay.

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,860
Search!

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,140
Sir, Guzhou's escaped.

35
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,140
Get to the point.

36
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,220
The guys on the stakeout said

37
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,060
one of them was small.

38
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,020
Looks can be disguised,

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,420
but you can't fake your body.

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,580
Is it a woman?

41
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,700
Miss Yu said
she was going inside to get changed.

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,900
Why hasn't she come out yet?

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,740
Did something

44
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,020
happen to her?

45
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,100
Check it out.

46
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,100
Miss Yu,

47
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,620
are you okay?

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,180
Miss Yu?

49
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Jiang?

50
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,420
Why are you here?

51
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,700
I've been tracking Guzhou.

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,300
Search carefully.

53
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,740
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,740
This way.

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,820
He must have escaped
through the underground water.

56
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,420
The water leads anywhere.

57
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,020
Send people to find their exit.

58
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,420
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,980
Sir,

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,020
they escaped from this exit.

61
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,100
Go.

62
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,620
Why are you here?

63
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
Miss Yu,

64
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,100
are you okay?

65
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,300
I've been tracking Guzhou,

66
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,540
but he got away.

67
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,380
When I got back, I heard

68
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,220
Qinghuan wasn't feeling well.

69
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,220
So I came up to check on her.

70
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,460
Then what about Guzhou?

71
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,780
It's my fault.

72
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,380
If seeing him again,

73
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,620
I will kill him myself.

74
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,460
Miss Yu, you're something.

75
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,300
Look how fragile you are.

76
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,940
Even my heart is broken.

77
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,900
No wonder the Governor couldn't wait

78
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,380
to see you the moment he returned.

79
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,140
Mohan pities me for being family-less.

80
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,820
Miss Chihoko,

81
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,300
please don't misinterpret it.

82
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,180
Is that so?

83
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,340
You said this morning

84
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,140
the rumors were unfounded.

85
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,300
Did you not mean it?

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,060
I mean what I say.

87
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,740
If that is

88
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,540
what you really think,

89
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,420
I have no way to change your mind.

90
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,500
I don't feel well.

91
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,820
Please excuse me.

92
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,980
See you then.

93
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,540
Where did you go?

94
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,500
I was in the room.

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,540
I didn't go anywhere.

96
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,660
I had a sophisticated plan

97
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,180
to capture Guzhou,

98
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,020
but it was ruined

99
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,100
because someone appeared.

100
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,300
They escaped through water.

101
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,700
You think it was me

102
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,900
just because I'm wet?

103
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,340
I spilled my tea.

104
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,980
So I came up for a shower.

105
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,100
Didn't want to embarrass you
by dripping around.

106
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,460
You surely covered your bases.

107
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,900
But don't forget

108
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,340
I taught you all these skills.

109
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,180
Yes,

110
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,580
thank you.

111
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,060
So?

112
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,860
Whatever you do,

113
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,140
I've got your back.

114
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,420
Just one thing.

115
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,540
Stay away from Chu Yunfan.

116
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,660
He is dangerous.

117
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,260
Can't I even choose my friends?

118
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,060
Anyone but not him.

119
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,100
I hope

120
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,460
you don't give me the impression

121
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,700

He's in love with you.

140
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,140
How could that be possible?

141
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,860
Jiang Mohan has to die.

142
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,020
If he colludes
with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce,

143
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,100
Beizhou will suffer tremendously.

144
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,420
Fan,

145
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,180
who exactly are you?

146
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,180
I do have an identity,

147
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,980
but I can't tell you now.

148
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,860
Just remember

149
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,820
I will always be Fan.

150
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Put more eyes on Chu Yunfan.

151
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,540
This time,

152
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,740
we may be able to take down
the Sparks Society.

153
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,420
Yes, sir.

154
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,860
Assassinate Jiang Mohan?

155
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,460
It is the latest order from Guzhou.

156
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,140
Why now?

157
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,780
The Japanese Chamber of Commerce
is colluding with the Marshal

158
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,260
to ship munitions into the country,

159
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,500
trying to stir up civil unrest.

160
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,780
I understand.

161
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,700
When a giant begins to rot,

162
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,340
the predators lurking around it

163
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,100
will tear it apart and eat it up.

164
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,140
Japan's ambition is blatantly obvious.

165
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,260
Jiang Mohan is the key figure
in all of this.

166
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,580
We must get rid of him

167
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,780
and stop all this from happening.

168
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,820
Okay.

169
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,820
But I will plan

170
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,580
this operation.

171
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
Be careful.

172
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm sure you know if we fail,

173
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,180
you will get killed too.

174
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,740
I might know

175
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,420
who Guzhou is.

176
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,380
Is he safe?

177
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,220
For now, yes.

178
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,620
He...

179
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,780
Don't tell anyone about him.

180
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,940
Including me.

181
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,780
Don't look for him either.

182
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,780
He will come to you.

183
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,740
Qinghuan.

184
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,540
I'll help you
lure Jiang Mohan to his death.

185
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,140
Just get him into my ambush

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,740
and I'll handle the rest.

187
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,780
What's your plan?

188
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,380
If your heart is empty,

189
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,660
fill it up with hatred.

190
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,180
Don't you see?

191
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,340
He's in love with you.

192
