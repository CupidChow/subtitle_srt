Mohan,

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,940
I probably got recorded.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,060
Hold on.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,140
Think carefully.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,180
Did you give anything away?

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,580
No.

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,260
They will tamper with the recording.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,660
Instead of waiting...

25
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,620
We'd rather be proactive.

Chihoko.

27
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,220
I've put up with you long enough.

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,100
Don't think you can just push me around.

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,260
Are you out of your mind?

30
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,780
What are you doing here drunk?

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,940
Get out of here!

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,260
You're the person who should get out.

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,940
Occupying someone else's home

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,020
I feel ashamed for you.

36
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,420
I'm telling you,

37
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,340
I can take over because I'm capable.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,300
Because I'm backed by the Marshal

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,340
and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

40
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,700
Only I can realize
Jiang Mohan's ambition.

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,940
You'll just be a hurdle for him.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,420
If you're so capable,

43
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,140
compete with me openly

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,540
instead of setting me up

45
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,060
and finding someone to test me

46
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,780

for the Sparks Society.

47
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,100
Test you?

48
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,940
An undercover agent
for the Sparks Society?

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,380
If you did it,

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,580
you have to admit it.

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,820
Okay.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,620

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,980

56
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,740
I suspect it's you who planned all this.

57
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,020
These were all your missions.

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,260
Setting up didn't work,

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,380
and now you've started to slander me.

60
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,300
That's all you've got.

61
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,340
Okay,

62
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,300

69

Did you get it?

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,300
Yes.

71
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,980
I can take over because I'm capable.

72
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,220

Fortunately,
we've identified each other.

77
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,860
Otherwise, I don't know
where I'd end up.

78
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,860
Are you afraid?

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,340

Miss Chihoko,

90
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,020
are you also an undercover agent
for the Sparks Society?

91
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,340
Are you confused?

92
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,220
So that's why you came to me

93
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,020
for a fight.

94
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,220
I'm just giving you a taste

95
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,020
of your own medicine.

96
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,420
You know very well

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,420
how you got your tape.

98
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,860
Miss Chihoko,

99
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,780
you set Qinghuan up

100
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,140
and fooled the Marshal.

101
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,260
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

102
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
I got the tape

103
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,380
from a female student.

104
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,140
I was just...

105
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,220
A female student, huh?

106
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,220
Come in.

107
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,460
Is it her?

108
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,500
Who told you to do it?

109
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,420
You only have one chance to live.

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,660
Think before you answer.

111
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,140
How dare you trick me
with a fake recording?

112
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,260
If I didn't have this tape up my sleeve,

113
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,700
would I be the one who died today?

114
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,060
Continue your meal.

115
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,100
Let's go.

116
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,820
Yu Qinghuan must die,

117
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,020
or forget our cooperation.

Please don't be mad.

119

We can talk this out,

120
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,660
right?

121
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,980
No.

122

123
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,580
who wants to cooperate with us.

124
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,660
Yes.

125
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,620
I'll wait for your good news.

126

127

don't let a woman

ruin our big plan.

129
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,460
Please cut to the chase.

130
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,900
To prevent the chamber

131
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,460
from stopping their cooperation with us,

132
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,580
we'll have to

133
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,260
send Yu Qinghuan
to reunite with her sister.
