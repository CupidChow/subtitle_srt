to obstruct official duties?

188
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,220
Don't put such a big label on me.

189
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,860
I can't afford it.

190
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,580
I'm just taking my brothers for a walk.

191
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,820
Is that illegal too?

192
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,180
If I want to kill you,
who cares about the law?

193
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,420
I am the law in Beizhou.

194
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,580
I've been waiting for you to say that.

195
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,540
Qing Gang has always been lawless.

196
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,660
Let's talk alone.

197
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,660
Give me that woman
from the Spark Society.

198
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,540
So I have your spies here.

199
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,220
I don't know it.

200
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,540
You mean

201
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,060
you insist on interfering

202
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,940
the matter of tonight.

203
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,420
And if I say yes?

204
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,140
If you insist on protecting that person,

205
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,940
it means you want to watch me die.

206
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,300
Go ahead,

207
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,580
shoot,

208
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,940
shoot here.

209
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,260
Huan!

210
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,460
I have paid all the favors
that I owe you.

211
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,100
