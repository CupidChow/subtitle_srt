187
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,300
for the rest of your life?

188
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,780
Qinghuan...

189
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,380
You're back.

190
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,060
Are you back to see me?

191
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,420
There, there.

192
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,580
Time can heal everything.

193
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,100
Power

194
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,300
is the best anodyne.

195
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,660
It's time

196
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,380
to start over.

197
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,380
[To Jiang Mohan, Marshal of Beizhou]
Congrats, Marshal.

198
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,340
Oh, wait,

199
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,140
I should call you

200
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,860
the Great Marshal
of three Provinces now.

201
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,900
It's all thanks to
Miss Chihoko and Jiang.

202
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,300
Let's work together more closely

203
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,660
and achieve more success.

204
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh, right,

205
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,380
the day after tomorrow,

206
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,380
the munitions will be
officially shipped in.

207
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,100
Let's have a celebration party together.

208
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,540
Okay.

209
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,420
Now I announce

210
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,820
Jiang Mohan, the Military Governor,

211
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,580
is now promoted

212
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
to Marshal of Beizhou.

213
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,740
Applause!

214
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,500
Traitor!

215
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,020
A lackey for the Japanese.

216
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,060
Traitor!

217
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,820
I asked you to applause.

218
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,860
Did you not hear it?

219
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,380
Shen Jun.

220
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,340
Why did you never ask me

221
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,900
why I did it?

222
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,580
Sir,

223
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,500
you gave me my life.

224
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,260
I don't have a position.

225
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,700
All I have is loyalty.

226
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,660
Whether you're right or wrong,

227
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,980
I will follow you to the death.

228
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,580
Now,

229
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,900
I only have you by my side.
