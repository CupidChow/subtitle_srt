[Episode 18]
[The sun you gave me lit up my life.]

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,380
[Yu's Residence]

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,060
It's been ages since I've been back.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,740
Why have you brought me here?

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,220
Do you remember this?

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,100
It is

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,900
the sun mark you left on me.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,580
It has lit up my life.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,460
After that,

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,340
I made up my mind

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,660
to do my best to protect you.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,060
You've done enough for me.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,140
But I want to do more for you.

27
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,260
The missions are getting
more and more dangerous.

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,940
I'm worried

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,300
I won't have a chance

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,700
to tell you my feelings.

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,380
Qinghuan...

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,220
Fan.

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,300
I know your feelings.

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,140
But what's between us

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,060
isn't love.

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,220
I might not be worth your effort.

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,900
I understand.

38
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,860
But I do it because I want to.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,620
You don't need to reciprocate my love,

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,740
but you can't stop my love for you.

41
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,020
Why call me here so urgently?

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,980
What happened?

43
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,940
Seven years ago,

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,940
Guzhou cut off
one of the Marshal's smuggling lines.

45
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
But it turns out someone got away.

46
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,740
He laid low for years
and secretly came to Beizhou.

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,420
He had heard Guzhou's voice

48
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
and must be eliminated.

49
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,780
We can't make any move
in the Marshal's Mansion.

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,020
We need to lure him out
so we can finish him off

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,780
while getting away safely.

52
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,060
If I could go to Joys of Life once,

53
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,100
it would be worth dying for.

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,740
I heard there are
three good things there.

55
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,100
Good wine, good dance,

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,780
and even better women.

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,740
Especially Miss Yu.

58
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,500
What a beauty.

59
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,260
Just one look, and you're hooked.

60
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,220
- Marshal.
- Marshal.

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,820
Marshal,

62
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
please take me to Joys of Life for fun.

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,380
For your safety,

64
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,820
until we catch Guzhou,

65
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,940
don't go anywhere.

66
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,500
My head...

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,260
What's wrong?

68
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm so dizzy.

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,300
Marshal.

70
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,940
I suddenly can't remember
Guzhou's voice.

71
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,060
I'll arrange it for you.

72
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,660
Thank you, Marshal.

73
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,780
What a rogue.

74
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,340
What an amazing place.

75
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,700
It must have cost a fortune.

76
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,980
Enjoy, sir.

77
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,460
Mr. Tian,

78
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,580
my senior officers will be here shortly.

79
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,140
You would only need
to identify Guzhou for me.

80
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,900
Don't worry, Marshal.

81
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,220
Mr. Tian,

82
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,100
when this is done,
we will send you abroad

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,060
and ensure you live comfortably
for the rest of your life.

84
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,060
It must be him.

85
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
Marshal,

86
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,020
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

87
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,900
I've brought you a good drink.

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,100
If you don't like it,

89
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,380
I will be frustrated.

90
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,020
I've always appreciated

91
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,580
how generous Miss Yu is.

92
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,540
Sir, I don't believe we've met before.

93
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,940
Here's to you.

94
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,180
Feel free to come to Joys of Life.

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,860
To you, Miss Yu.

96
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,500
You're gorgeous.

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,020
Oops.

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,380
I'm so sorry.

99
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,460
It's okay.

100
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,580
Miss Yu.

101
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,900
We have important matters to discuss.

102
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,060
We won't bother you anymore.

103
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,180
Then,

104
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,140
I'll leave you alone.

105
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,140
Don't go.

106
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,140
I've been on the run all these years.

107
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,180
Haven't made money
or slept with a woman.

108
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,780
What a miserable life I have.

109
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,700
Why do you say that, Mr. Tian?

110
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,700
Miss Yu

111
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,700
is one of the most beautiful women
in Beizhou.

112
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,620
Why not have her

113
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,660
spend some good time with you?

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,820
Thank you.

115
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,020
That's not a good idea.

116
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,980
What should I tell Jiang?

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,700
Marshal.

118
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,900
Tian,

119
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,140
these are my senior officers.

120
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,900
Identify Guzhou for me.

121
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,300
Tian.

122
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,620
No rush.

123
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,060
Wait for me. I'll be back.

124
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,340
There's plenty of time.

125
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,820
If Mr. Tian pulls this off,

126
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,180
it will be a huge help for me.

127
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Keep your guard up.

128
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,020
Make sure no one tips off
the Military Governor.

129
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,140
Yes, Miss.

130
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,620
Miss Yu.

131
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,180
You're so gorgeous.

132
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,940
Mr. Tian,

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,220
don't rush.

134
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,780
We have plenty of time.

135
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,460
We can take it slow.

136
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,180
Let's have some drinks.

137
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,420
Come.

138
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,860
You really get me.

139
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,180
I like a bit of thrill.

140
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,340
I will give you

141
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,540
something even more interesting.

142
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,340
This way. Have a seat.

143
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,100
It seems

144
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,140
you've got good news.

145
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,980
Once we catch Guzhou,

146
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,460
we can get that shipment into the port.

147
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,140
Here.

148
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,420
Cheers.

149
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,420
Sir.

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,820
You can't go there.

151
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,100
It's a good day.

152
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,020
One bottle is not enough.

153
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,860
Let me grab more for you

154
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,060
and we'll have a good time.

155
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,220
Sure. I'm looking forward.

156
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,820
Don't move.

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,220
Sir.

158
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,740
What's happening?

159
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,300
Chihoko asked Mr. Tian
to violate Miss Yu.

160
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,460
They are upstairs.

161
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,620
You...

162
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,020
What are you doing?

163
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,100
What's with that?

164
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
What are you doing?

165
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm looking for an answer.

166
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,900
What answer?

167
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,260
Help!

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
Don't come any closer!

169
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,660
What are you doing?

170
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,820
Don't come any closer!

171
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,300
Help!

172
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,860
You...

173
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,220
Qinghuan,

174
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,420
are you okay?

175
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:23,980
You...

176
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,180
You are...

177
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,660
Die!

178
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,300
Let's go.

179
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,060
Did you kill Mr. Tian?

180
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,100
Do you know who he was?

181
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,580
I don't care who he was.

182
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,060
Whoever touches Qinghuan

183
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,340
is dead.

184
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,260
He was the only one
who could identify Guzhou.

185
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,980
You could have punished him
in many ways

186
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,540
instead of killing him.

187
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,620
I killed him to remind you.

188
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,140
Don't ever do anything to Qinghuan
behind my back again.

189
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,460
