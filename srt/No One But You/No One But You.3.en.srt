88
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,940

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,460
I was worried about you,

Chu Yunfan

He just came back from abroad.

101
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,940
His background is very clean,

102
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,740
but it's too clean.

103
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,820
Qing Gang's docks are a must-win for me.

104
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,540
Marshal, the thorn in your side,

105
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,540
that undercover agent Guzhou,

106
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,900
his secret operations
started only last year.

107
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,260
You mean

108
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,020
Chu Yunfan is Guzhou?

109
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,860
Using Guzhou as an excuse
to seize the docks

110
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,420
is a great plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

111
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,060
But

112
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,820
the Qing Gang has many connections,

113
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,260
we can't pin just anything on them.

114
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,620

119
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,180
and now you keep her by your side.

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,220
Aren't you afraid
of nourishing a viper in your bosom?

121
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,420
You're here, Mohan.

122
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,060
Or

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,460
have you developed feelings for her?

124
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,860
Marshal, it is as you said.

125
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,180
I killed her sister.

126
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,100
Loving her

127
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,500
is indeed a bit shameless.

128
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,420
That's good.

129
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,780
Don't let a woman
get in the way of greatness.

130
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,660
