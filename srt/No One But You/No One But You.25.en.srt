from the Sparks Society

175
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,860
and made it here.

176

181
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,060
she talked about Chu Yunfan and Anning,

182
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,100
I was sure there was
something wrong with her.

183
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,500
But she got away.

184
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,260
She was trying to get you to talk more.

185
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,500
Someone must be behind her.

186
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,020
She was carrying luggage.

187
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,420
Was there a recording device inside?

188
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,580
Mohan,

189
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,460
I probably got recorded.

190
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,500
Hold on.

191
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,740
Think carefully.

192
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,460
Did you give anything away?

193
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,900
No.

194
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,780
Try the cake.

195
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,380
Okay.

196
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,860
What's wrong?

197
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,580
You don't feel well?

198
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,340
Marshal,

199
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,380
what's with this now?

200
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,380
Jiang,

201
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,180
you've been fooled by this woman.

202
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,660
She

203
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,980
is an undercover agent
for the Sparks Society.

204
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,340
If you don't have proof,

205
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,340
how could you

206
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,900
just put that label on me?

207
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,260
All right.

208
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,500
I'll prove it so you'll stop struggling.

209
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,660
Let me tell you.

210
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,380
I'm from the Sparks Society.

211
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,260
Almost got suspected.

212
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,460
But I will not make
the same mistake again.

213
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,140
Get to a position like mine,

214
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,900
so you can keep the Marshal
and the Military Governor

215
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,100
in the dark.

216
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,420
What awaits them is death.

217
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,100
Where did you get this?

218
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,860
That is not important.

219
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,180
What matters is

220
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,940
how you are going to explain it.

221
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,260
This

222
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,420
is not something I can explain.

223
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,420
Well,

224
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,860
I have a tape here too.

225
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,900
Why not

226
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,220
listen to it together?

227
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,980
I'm an undercover agent
for the Sparks Society.

228
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,100
Codename Quechao.

229
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,020
I planned Mr. Tian's death

230
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,740
and Chu Yunfan's escape.

231
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,980
The Marshal

232
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,780
has started to suspect my identity.

233
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,140
We can't let this stumbling block

234
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,260
affect our mission.

235
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,540
We must kill him.
