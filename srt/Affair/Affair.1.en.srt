1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,320
Wan

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,120
That’s enough.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,960
I don’t want to do this anymore.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,960
But I do.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,280
Wan

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,600
I can’t do it.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,960
I can.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,000
You just have to let go.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,520
How do I let go?

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,240
You know what we’re doing is wrong.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,680
If we go any further,

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,280
there’s no turning back, Wan.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,120
Then keep going forward.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,160
Ever since I came back to you,

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,480
I’ve never thought about turning back.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,920
Wan

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,680
I can’t do this.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
I don’t want to be a mistress.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,360
Then just stay still.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,440
I’ll do it myself.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,120
Wan, stop being so selfish, will you?

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,920
You know what I mean.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Do you remember the promise you made me?

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,080
You said

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,920
if I graduated as a doctor,

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,520
I could ask you for anything, and you’d give it to me.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,480
Why are you bringing that up now?

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,400
Because I know now

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
what I want.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,600
And what is it that you want?

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,760
I want you.

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,320
If this isn’t something big,

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,440
you’re in trouble.

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,120
Then I’m definitely safe.

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
Go ahead, spill it.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Your band got first place again!

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,200
Take that!

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
Why am I still getting hit?

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,640
Because it’s not that big of a deal.

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
I already saw it coming.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,440
True enough.

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,760
Who could beat you, huh?

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,720
You write both the lyrics and the melody by yourself.

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,560
I even play the instruments myself.

45
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,600
You’re the best in the world, Seang Pleng!

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
Let me ask you honestly.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,640
In your eyes,

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,520
is there anything I’m not good at?

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,320
See?

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,840
So you should get used to my success by now.

51
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,079
It’s nothing to get excited about.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,640
Well, I’m just happy!

53
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,960
Did you take the competition test?

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah.

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,040
How did it go? Did you do well?

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,680
I managed to do okay.

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,920
Don’t tell me...

58
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
You failed in the first round?

59
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,120
Not everyone can be as brilliant as you!

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,040
I’m just the housekeeper’s kid.

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,560
And you’re the child of...

62
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,560
It doesn’t matter whose child you are.

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,480
You can be as talented as I am.

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,240
You just need to take it more seriously.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,760
You’re acting like it’s all just a game.

66
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,000
How could you enter a competition without even reading a single page?

67
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
You’re just spending all your time with me instead.

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,520
See? Being with me too much

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,720
is making you...

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Stop complaining already.

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,720
I’ll make up for it next time, okay?

72
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,040
You always say that.

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,160
I won’t complain anymore.

74
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,560
Where are you going?

75
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,159
- Where are you going? I’m coming with you.
- Wan

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
You still haven't stopped, huh?

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,360
You’re all smiles, so I guess everything went well?

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,080
It’s not 100% yet.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,440
Some of the partners are still uncertain about the new investments.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,680
They see our success in real estate,

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,159
so they think we should play it safe.

82
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,560
Just keep doing the same things.

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,200
That’s understandable.

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,280
We’re talking about a huge investment.

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
Anyone would be scared.

86
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
But every investment comes with risk.

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,360
And if we’re not bold,

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
how will we ever know

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
whether the outcome will be positive or not?

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,160
But this time,

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,720
I’m confident it’ll be positive.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,360
If you’re confident,

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,040
then I’m confident too.

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,480
Madam, where would you like me to put this vase?

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,720
Place it on Wut’s desk, please.

96
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,440
Everyone,

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,840
Seang Pleng’s band won the competition again!

98
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,880
Well done, dear.

99
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,880
I knew you’d win an award, Pleng.

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,080
How about we all go out for dinner tonight to celebrate?

101
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,560
Everyone’s coming along.

102
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
Pleng, just say what you want to eat.

103
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,560
It’s on me.

104
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,120
No need to trouble yourself, Dad.

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,480
It’s not Pleng’s first win, and it won’t be the last either.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,440
If you treat me every time I win,

107
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
you’ll go broke!

108
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
I’m so happy for you, Pleng.

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
Aunt Wi.

110
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,520
I owe you a big thank you, Aunt Wi.

111
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,560
For taking care of me since I was a child.

112
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,640
If it weren’t for you, Aunt Wi,

113
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,840
I wouldn’t be this talented.

114
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,920
You’re giving me too much credit, Pleng.

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
Not at all!

116
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,360
I’m actually jealous of Wan.

117
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,840
She has a mom who can cook anything!

118
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,920
Unlike my mom.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,720
She even burns fried eggs!

120
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,240
Hey! Watch it!

121
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Just kidding!

122
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,560
Don’t be jealous of Wan, Pleng.

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,800
What is there to be jealous of with this kid?

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
She’s never accomplished anything.

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,680
She doesn’t even try.

126
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,800
But everyone has their own strengths.

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,120
We shouldn’t compare children in a way that hurts them.

128
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,400
I wouldn’t dare compare Wan to Pleng.

129
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
I just want her to improve herself.

130
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,360
Especially since she’s always with you.

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,080
She should see you as an example,

132
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,200
not be useless like this.

133
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,640
But I don’t agree with you, Wi.

134
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,320
There are many things Wan is better at than Pleng.

135
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,160
Think about it, Wi.

136
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,640
There were many times when Pleng had to rely on Wan.

137
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,760
That shows she’s not better than Wan at everything.

138
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,600
Each of these two kids has their own strengths.

139
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,400
As parents,

140
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,400
we need to recognize that. When they do well, we should praise them.

141
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,280
Don’t just criticize them.

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,680
Otherwise,

143
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
they’ll start to feel

144
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,880
bad about themselves and carry that burden in their hearts.

145
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,120
Wan

146
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,800
Wan

147
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,920
What is she doing?

148
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,160
Wan—oh, careful!

149
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,320
Are you hurt?

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,880
Of course I am, what do you think?

151
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,400
So, what are you doing? Huh?

152
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,559
I’m looking for the northeast.

153
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,840
They say that’s where you can see the Gemini constellation most clearly.

154
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,960
Gemini?

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,360
Why are you looking for that?

156
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,880
Because I want to see it.

157
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,080
Just kidding.

158
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,560
I’ve read its history, and it’s pretty interesting.

159
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
Most people think it’s about lovers.

160
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,120
But actually, they can’t love each other.

161
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Why not?

162
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Because they’re siblings.

163
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
In Latin,

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,800
Gemini means twins.

165
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,400
If it’s that sad, maybe you shouldn’t look at it.

166
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,520
It’ll just make you feel depressed.

167
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,200
I’m not the kind of person
who believes something just because I’ve heard it.

168
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,680
I need to see it with my own eyes.

169
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,960
And then I use this... and this

170
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,000
to help me decide.

171
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,400
You must have a lot of free time.

172
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,720
Yeah, guess so.

173
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,240
Teenage life...

174
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,840
It’s the easiest time of your life.

175
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,400
So if you want to do something, you better do it now.

176
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,000
Once you grow up and living paycheck to paycheck,

177
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,680
you won’t have time for things like this anymore.

178
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,600
Living paycheck to paycheck?

179
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,920
Is that all you see for your future?

180
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Don’t you want to do something bigger than that?

181
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,360
No.

182
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I wasn’t born to be someone important like you.

183
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,440
No one is born important.

184
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,720
Everyone has to work hard to get there.

185
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,680
I don’t have that.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,960
Didn’t you hear what my mom said?

187
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,680
I heard.

188
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
But the more Aunt Wi says that,

189
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
the more you should try, shouldn’t you?

190
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,200
Pleng.

191
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,560
Huh?

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,840
Come down here for a sec.

193
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,720
Why should I try?

194
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,640
When I’m already satisfied with what I have.

195
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,960
What do you mean by that?

196
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,440
I just don’t want anything.

197
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,720
I just want to be

198
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,000
Miss Wanwiwa

199
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,880
who stays by Miss Sadabpin’s side forever.

200
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,200
If I have you,

201
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,320
I don’t need anything else.

202
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,440
But...

203
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,560
You can’t be stuck to me like this forever, can you?

204
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
What if one day I get a boyfriend

205
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
and I have to get married?

206
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,760
What will you do then?

207
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,400
Good point.

208
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
I’ve never thought about that.

209
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,280
If you actually get married,

210
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,240
I’d feel really lonely.

211
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I know!

212
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,400
To prevent that from happening,

213
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,320
I need to find a boyfriend before you do.

214
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,840
But I don’t think I have what it takes to find one.

215
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
Pleng, can you help me?

216
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,600
Help me find a boyfriend, please.

217
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,680
Hmm.

218
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,640
I’ll help you find one.

219
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,480
Why did you bring me here?

220
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,240
I don’t understand these pictures at all.

221
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,480
I have no idea what they mean.

222
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,760
Do you understand them?

223
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,960
So why did you bring me here?

224
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,080
Haven’t you heard?

225
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,080
If you want something,

226
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
you need to put yourself near it.

227
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,680
I still don’t get it.

228
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,840
You asked me to help you find a boyfriend,

229
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,200
and that’s what I’m doing.

230
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,280
Still don’t get it.

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,840
To meet a perfect guy,

232
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,840
you need to be in places like this.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,400
Most men who appreciate art

234
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,520
have good taste and money.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,160
You don’t want a clueless, broke boyfriend, right?

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,880
I don’t know.

237
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,800
As long as he’s a good person, that should be enough.

238
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,360
Are you planning to become a nun or something?

239
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,920
That’s sinful thinking.

240
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,120
Hey.

241
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,000
I think that guy looks interesting.

242
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,320
That guy?

243
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,120
Tall.

244
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,040
Fair-skinned. Looks rich.

245
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Hello.

246
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,040
Where are you?

247
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,480
Frank!

248
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,000
When did you get back to Thailand?

249
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
I brought back a little something for you.

250
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,480
I was planning to surprise you.

251
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,240
What did you bring, Frank?

252
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,640
Don’t tell me...

253
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Yay!

254
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,320
Really?

255
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Where are you right now?

256
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,080
I’m at your house.

257
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
Wait for me, Frank.

258
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,480
I’ll be right there!

259
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,960
I’m nearby.

260
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,600
Alright, hurry up.

261
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,920
Ok!

262
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,040
Let’s go home.

263
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,520
Wait, wait! Why are you so excited?

264
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,280
Are you that eager to see him?

265
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
No.

266
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,200
I’m excited about the gift, not him.

267
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Do you know how rare it is?

268
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,360
So, since he managed to find it for you,

269
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,680
you must be really impressed, right?

270
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,640
Looks like he has a chance to win your heart.

271
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,880
Win my heart? What do you mean, Wan?

272
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,360
He’s flirting with you, Pleng.

273
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,760
Even someone on Mars could see it.

274
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,680
That’s ridiculous, Wan.

275
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,520
Frank and I have known each other since we were kids.

276
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,440
And he’s been flirting with you since you were kids too.

277
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,000
What he’s doing now is just scoring points.

278
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,240
And it looks like it’s working.

279
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,880
Be honest...

280
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,080
If one day Frank asks you to be his girlfriend,

281
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
and you say yes,

282
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,120
what will I do?

283
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,840
I’ll be all alone, right?

284
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,240
Stop talking nonsense.

285
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
Even if Frank really does like me,

286
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,000
there’s no way we’d ever be together.

287
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,000
Because I don’t like Frank.

288
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,440
I’ve never liked him, and I never will.

289
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,600
Okay?

290
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,640
Yeah.

291
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
Forget it, let’s go home.

292
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,120
Wait, hold on. I need to use the bathroom real quick.

293
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,640
You can wait for me at the exit.

294
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Excuse me.

295
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,880
Is this yours?

296
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,720
Oh, yes it is.

297
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,520
Thank you.

298
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,120
Wait.

299
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,640
My name’s Ek.

300
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
What’s your name?

301
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,640
My name’s Wan.

302
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,840
Would it be okay...

303
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,359
if I asked for your number?

304
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,760
But it’s fine if you don’t want to.

305
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,960
Whatever makes you comfortable.

306
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,119
Hmm.

307
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,720
I’ll call you sometime.

308
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,000
Hmm.

309
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,680
Pleng!

310
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,800
Pleng!

311
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,000
Pleng, where are you going?

312
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,400
I’m going home.

313
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
Pleng!

314
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you mad at me?

315
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,920
What were you talking about with that guy?

316
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,120
It was nothing.

317
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,600
He just returned my ribbon and...

318
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,960
asked for my number.

319
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,160
And you gave it to him?

320
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,560
Yeah.

321
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,080
So, are you mad at me?

322
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,080
Are you upset that he asked for my number instead of yours?

323
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,200
Is that what this is about?

324
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,040
Wan...

325
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,480
Are you serious right now?

326
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,680
Do you really think I would be jealous of you?

327
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,040
How did you come up with that?

328
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,800
Then why are you avoiding me?

329
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,760
I just don’t want to ride home with you anymore.

330
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,360
Let’s go separately.

331
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,240
See you at home.

332
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,040
Aren’t you happy to see me at all?

333
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Nope.

334
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,000
I’m in a bad mood.

335
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,280
What’s wrong?

336
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,560
Did you fight with Wan?

337
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,120
How did you know?

338
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,200
You both went out together, but didn’t come back together.

339
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, and most importantly, you don’t have many friends.

340
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120
Frank!

341
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
So, if you were going to fight with anyone, it’d be Wan.

342
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,760
That’s rude.

343
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
What’s rude about it? It’s the truth.

344
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,360
Here you go.

345
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,680
I hope this cheers you up.

346
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,160
Oh!

347
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,800
You really found it!

348
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,400
Let me tell you, it was almost impossible to get.

349
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,760
Thank you so much!

350
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,040
Now I just need a few more, and I’ll complete my Meg Ryan movie collection.

351
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,760
In that case,

352
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,320
don’t you think just a thank you isn’t enough?

353
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,440
So, what do you want, Frank?

354
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,440
Maybe...

355
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,840
watch a movie with me,

356
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,800
and maybe treat me to dinner.

357
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,400
Fine.

358
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,360
But there aren’t any good movies right now.

359
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,840
Once there is, I’ll be the one to invite you, okay?

360
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Okay. Deal.

361
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,240
Alright.

362
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,960
But for now,

363
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,400
you need to go home, Frank, because I’m going to spend all my time

364
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,840
watching my Meg Ryan movies.

365
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,480
Wow, you’re kicking me out after I just gave you that?

366
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,480
Go on.

367
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,160
Go on, Frank.

368
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
- Why so mean?
- Let me enjoy my new stuff!

369
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
Alright, alright, I’m going.

370
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,320
Don’t forget, okay?

371
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,240
Okay.

372
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,960
Bye-bye.

373
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,120
Bye.

374
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
Wan...

375
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,760
I can watch it alone.

376
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
Pleng.

377
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,080
Oh, how long have you been standing there?

378
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,160
A while.

379
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,280
Why are you hiding?

380
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,120
Don’t tell me you were eavesdropping on me and Frank.

381
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,920
Are you going to watch a movie with Frank?

382
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,800
I thought you didn’t like him.

383
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,480
I don’t.

384
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,440
I just don’t want to owe anyone a favor.

385
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,280
And what’s that got to do with you?

386
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,360
It’s not.

387
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,080
I just don’t want you to go.

388
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,480
Why do you care?

389
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,040
You just gave that guy your number, didn’t you?

390
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,360
So, when I go out with Frank,

391
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,680
you can go out with that guy.

392
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,320
That way, you won’t feel lonely, right?

393
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
But I’ve thought about it,

394
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,600
and even if I have him,

395
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,520
I’d still feel lonely.

396
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,720
Because he’s not you.

397
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,440
No one can take your place.

398
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
What? Well, that’s true.

399
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,160
No one can ever really replace someone, right?

400
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,720
Watching a movie with Frank

401
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,360
isn’t as fun as watching it with you.

402
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
That’s true.

403
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Wanna watch it together?

404
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,080
Let me see.

405
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,480
This one?

406
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
Meg Ryan, huh?

407
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,440
She’s so cool, you know.

408
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,560
She’s always been cool.

409
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,080
But being a doctor makes her even cooler.

410
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,960
Do you like doctors, Pleng?

411
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,800
Who doesn’t?

412
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,480
Doctors make a lot of money, and they help people too.

413
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,680
Anyone who’s close to one would feel safe.

414
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,040
Should I become a doctor then?

415
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
No way.

416
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,560
You’re too dumb.

417
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,040
Watch your mouth!

418
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,320
But honestly, I think

419
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
you could become one, you know.

420
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
But you’d have to work really, really hard.

421
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
And you’d need to be way more active.

422
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,360
Look at the heroine in this movie.

423
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,760
She wakes up early

424
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,480
and rides her bike to work.

425
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
And look at you.

426
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,400
Did you do your homework today?

427
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,600
Oops.

428
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
Not yet.

429
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,640
See?

430
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,240
Alright, after I finish this, I’ll get right to my homework.

431
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,600
I’ll show you that

432
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,800
when I set my mind to something,

433
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,280
I can do it.

434
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,560
Alright, smart one.

435
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,120
I’m going to become a doctor.

436
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
Let’s hope that’s true.

437
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,760
Why do you act like you don’t believe me?

438
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
If I do it,

439
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
what will you give me?

440
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840
Do it first, then you can ask.

441
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,880
And if you want something,

442
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,520
I’ll give it to you.

443
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,080
Really?

444
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
You promise?

445
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
So,

446
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,880
what do you want?

447
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,440
Hmm?

448
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,080
I don’t know yet.

449
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
But remember this promise well.

450
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,120
When the day comes that I’ve done it,

451
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,160
I’ll come to claim it.

452
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,480
It’s okay, take it slow...

453
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,120
Just like that, yes.

454
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Got it, got it. Hold it steady.

455
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,840
Just like that, just like that.

456
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,040
Don’t forget to turn.

457
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,960
Yes, yes.

458
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,360
Slowly, slowly.

459
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,800
Great job! Excellent!

460
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,440
What are you guys doing?

461
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,440
- Oh, Pleng!
- Hey, Frank!

462
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,640
- Wan!
- Ouch, Frank!

463
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,960
Wan!

464
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,400
Are you hurt, Wan?

465
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,600
Are you crazy?

466
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,000
You’re always getting yourself hurt!

467
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,280
Does it hurt?

468
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Not me!

469
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,960
I was just practicing riding a bike, so when I become a doctor,

470
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,240
I can ride a bike to work!

471
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,400
So you want to be like Meg Ryan, huh?

472
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,640
No, I’ll be Dr. Wanwiwa, just like Meg Ryan!

473
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,280
Ouch.

474
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
And what about you, Frank?

475
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,440
What are you doing here so early at my house?

476
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,560
Oh, I brought something for your aunt.

477
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,960
Last time I came to see you, I forgot to bring it.

478
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,360
So I ran into Wan practicing her biking.

479
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,560
I haven’t seen you in a few years, Wan.

480
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,880
You’ve really changed a lot.

481
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,880
Do you want to keep practicing, Wan?

482
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,080
Maybe we should stop for now, Frank.

483
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,160
Can’t you see Wan’s already hurt?

484
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,320
It’s no big deal.

485
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
A girl with scars looks cool.

486
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,880
I like it. It makes her look tough.

487
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,040
Not like those delicate girls who only care about looking pretty.

488
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,520
You can like whatever you want, Frank,

489
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,120
but I don’t.

490
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,920
Wan, go treat your wounds now.

491
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,000
Go on.

492
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,760
Well, I’ll excuse myself then.

493
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,720
Thank you, Frank, for helping me out.

494
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,440
Wait, Pleng!

495
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,600
What is it?

496
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,160
Well...

497
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,880
Does Wan have a boyfriend?

498
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,000
Why are you asking?

499
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,880
I think she’s pretty cute.

500
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Yes, she does.

501
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,680
Is Frank trying to hit on you?

502
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,840
No, Mom.

503
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,440
Where did you even get that idea?

504
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,080
Good, then.

505
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,080
That kid seems useless.

506
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,320
Just a rich boy wasting his days.

507
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,080
He may have a lot of money,

508
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,120
but you can’t count on him for a future.

509
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,920
Mom, what are you even thinking?

510
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,360
Oh?

511
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,960
Well, if you’re going to date someone,

512
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,200
you should find someone good, right?

513
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,840
Someone who has both

514
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,520
money and brains.

515
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,320
That way, he can take care of you for life,

516
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,400
not drag you into hardship.

517
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,920
If I’m going to date someone,

518
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,960
I just want him to be a good person.

519
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I’m confident I can take care of myself.

520
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,640
Oh, really?

521
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,920
Then show me.

522
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,480
Get better at your studies first.

523
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,320
And when you compete with others,
try winning sometimes, like everyone else.

524
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,200
Stop wasting your time like this every day.

525
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
Wan, haven’t you treated your wounds yet?

526
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,200
Aunt Wi, look at your daughter.

527
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,520
She wants to be a doctor so badly, and now look what happened.

528
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,080
Come on, let’s go treat your wounds. I’ll take care of it.

529
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,640
You’re pretty good at treating wounds.

530
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,120
Maybe you should be the doctor instead of me.

531
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,000
No thanks.

532
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,320
I’m not very good at academics.

533
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,720
And besides,

534
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,760
I’m terrified of blood.

535
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,320
But you’re treating my wounds?

536
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,080
Well, it’s you.

537
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,240
If it were someone else, I wouldn’t do it.

538
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,320
I’m so happy to hear that.

539
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,880
Do you know that the reason I want to become a doctor

540
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,280
is because I only want to treat you?

541
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,120
Are you crazy, Wan?

542
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,640
Doctors have to treat everyone.

543
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,360
No picking favorites, understand?

544
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,640
Got it?

545
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,640
Got it.

546
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,280
I’ll do everything you say,

547
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,560
but don’t forget our promise.

548
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,280
I know, I know.

549
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,680
Once you’ve done it, come tell me.

550
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,880
Wan, you’re answering my call now?

551
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,360
Who is this?

552
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,160
It’s me, Ek.

553
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,480
Ek?

554
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
Which Ek?

555
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,000
I’m the one who asked for your number at the gallery.

556
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,600
Don’t you remember me, Wan?

557
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,440
Oh.

558
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,640
Hold on a sec.

559
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,400
You’ve got quite the charm, don’t you?

560
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,040
Pleng, Pleng!

561
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,320
You’re mad at me, aren’t you?

562
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,160
Can you stop asking that question already?

563
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,320
Why would I be mad at you?

564
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,880
If you want to flirt with someone
or if someone likes you, that’s your business.

565
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,280
Damn it!

566
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,040
What’s wrong, Pleng?

567
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,000
Can’t figure it out?

568
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,280
If I had, do you think I’d be sitting here frustrated?

569
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,680
What a dumb question!

570
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,080
Why don’t you take a break or do something else for a while?

571
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,720
Or maybe we could talk about something other than music.

572
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,400
It might help clear your mind.

573
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,280
Like this...

574
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
the prize money from the latest competition.

575
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
What are you guys going to spend it on?

576
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,200
Did someone already spend it on a buffet?

577
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,560
I’m giving it to my mom, of course.

578
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
But the money we got...

579
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,360
We only got 5,000 baht each, right?

580
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,640
You’re proud of giving just that much to your mom?

581
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,240
Are you really proud of that?

582
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,080
Yeah, I am.

583
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,840
5,000 baht is still money.

584
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,800
It’s money.

585
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,720
But it’s really not that much.

586
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,160
It doesn’t compare to how your mom’s raised you since birth.

587
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,720
And what about you, Pleng?

588
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,920
What are you going to do with your money?

589
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,000
I’m not doing anything with it.

590
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Just saving it.

591
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,000
It’s so little, I don’t know what to buy.

592
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,320
Little?

593
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,800
Must be nice being rich.

594
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,800
You don’t even get excited when you get money like everyone else.

595
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,520
You must have a lot, huh?

596
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,960
Are you mocking me?

597
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,320
No, I’m not.

598
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I’m just saying what I see.

599
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Patty...

600
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Pleng.

601
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,600
If you're in a bad mood, I think you should just go home.

602
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,800
Staying here won’t help; it’s useless.

603
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,120
Not only will we not get anything done,

604
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,040
but it’ll bring everyone else down too.

605
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,440
Fine.

606
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,400
I’ll go.

607
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,800
I’d like to see how you guys manage without me.

608
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,240
What can any of you even do?

609
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,560
Honestly,

610
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,440
I don’t want to be in the band with her at all.

611
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
Where does she get off thinking she’s rich and talented?

612
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
Always looking down on others.

613
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,680
No wonder she has no friends.

614
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,200
If it weren’t for us,

615
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,240
she wouldn’t have anyone to hang out with.

616
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,520
She does have a friend, though.

617
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,200
Wanwiwa from the science class.

618
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,480
Wanwiwa?

619
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,720
Yeah.

620
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,000
The cute one, right?

621
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,040
Yeah.

622
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,040
You guys don’t know that Wanwiwa’s

623
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,680
the daughter of Pleng’s housekeeper.

624
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
If she ever pisses Pleng off,

625
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,680
her mom’s going to be in trouble too.

626
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240
She’s probably being pushed around just like us.

627
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,520
So what are you guys going to do about it?

628
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
You’re just going to keep putting up with this?

629
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,199
We have to.

630
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,560
We still need her dad to sponsor us for the next competition.

631
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,880
But the moment she slips up,

632
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,400
I’ll be the first to stomp her down. I’ll stomp her hard.

633
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,040
No, no, don’t say anything.

634
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,080
Count me in. I’ve hated her for a long time.

635
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,239
I just forgot my notebook.

636
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,199
So I came back to get it.

637
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,679
Thanks for everything up until now.

638
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,360
To you guys, it was probably just

639
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,200
for your own benefit, right?

640
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,320
But to me, it wasn’t.

641
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,000
I saw you all as friends.

642
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,960
From now on, we’ll go our separate ways.

643
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
Wan!

644
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,880
Wan!

645
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,600
Wan!

646
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,520
Wan!

647
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,840
What’s up, Pleng?

648
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,120
Where are you?

649
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,720
Why aren’t you home yet?

650
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,560
I went shopping.

651
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,880
What’s up with you?

652
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
You were mad at me yesterday,

653
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,920
and now you’re looking for me today?

654
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,600
Fine, I’m not mad anymore.

655
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,960
But now I’m about to get mad again

656
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,040
because I came home and you’re not here.

657
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,720
Pleng, you’re way too attached to me.

658
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,560
Stop talking so much.

659
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
And hurry up and get home now!

660
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,400
Calm down, I haven’t even finished picking out my stuff yet.

661
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,400
Oh, stop picking, Wan!

662
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,200
Just come home already.

663
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,200
Come home and give me a smile.

664
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,240
Why do you want me to smile?

665
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,320
Because...

666
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,880
It’ll make me feel better.

667
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,840
Hello?

668
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,760
Why’d you go quiet?

669
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,440
Nothing.

670
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,920
I’ll just hurry and buy my stuff and come back, okay?

671
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,920
Okay.

672
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,640
Okay, okay, see you soon.

673
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,680
What’s bothering you, sweetheart?

674
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,920
You can tell?

675
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,040
Of course I can.

676
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,520
There are only a few reasons
why you’d be sitting here playing the piano alone.

677
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,480
If you’re not practicing for a competition,

678
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,360
it means you’re in a bad mood.

679
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,680
Actually,

680
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,200
I’m just a bit upset about something at school.

681
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,840
But just seeing your face, Dad,

682
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,280
makes it all go away.

683
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,920
Oh, wow!

684
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,520
Saying things like that, are you trying to butter me up? Huh?

685
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,920
No, not at all.

686
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,480
As long as I have you, Mom,

687
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,120
and Wan, I don’t need anything else.

688
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,240
Wan too?

689
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,680
You’re so attached to your friend!

690
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,200
So when are you going to have a boyfriend?

691
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,160
Huh?

692
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,480
Do you want me to have a boyfriend, Dad?

693
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
No, I don’t.

694
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,000
I think it’s not the right time yet.

695
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,720
But if you want one, I won’t stop you.

696
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,560
Just that, before you decide to date someone,

697
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,680
you have to bring him to meet me first.

698
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,360
I need to see if he’s good enough.

699
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,240
I think before he passes Dad's test,

700
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,120
he needs to meet my standards first.

701
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,120
What kind of person does he need to be?

702
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,880
He has to be...

703
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,520
as capable as you, Dad.

704
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,880
And...

705
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,920
he has to have a smile as beautiful as Wan’s.

706
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,440
In that case, I think...

707
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,440
you’ll be single for a long time.

708
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,120
Because someone like that

709
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,040
won’t be easy to find.

710
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,160
So, are you tired today, Dad?

711
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,240
Not at all, I’m feeling great.

712
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,800
Last night, I composed a new song, just a little.

713
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,400
But I only finished the intro.

714
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,560
No lyrics yet.

715
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,560
Show me.

716
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,080
Wan!

717
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,400
Hey!

718
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,280
Why didn’t you tell me you weren’t dressed?

719
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,160
Are you done yet?

720
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,560
Pleng.

721
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,760
If you know I’m waiting, why didn’t you hurry up and come find me?

722
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,920
Making me come down to find you, is that right?

723
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,120
I just wanted to finish showering first.

724
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,200
If I came up all smelly, you’d just complain again.

725
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,080
Don’t try to think for me.

726
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,960
I’m not thinking for you.
I just know you that well.

727
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,320
What’s up with you today?
Why are you so unusually whiny?

728
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,920
Hmmm.

729
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,040
I just realized...

730
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,600
that I only have one true friend.

731
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,160
And that’s you.

732
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,440
I just left the band.

733
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,920
But don’t ask me why yet.

734
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,720
I’ll tell you when I’m ready.

735
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,000
It’s okay, you still have me.

736
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Because I know I’ve got you, that’s why I’m not too upset.

737
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,800
So, can I sleep over tonight?

738
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,640
Sure, give me five minutes.

739
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,360
Wait for me in your room, okay?

740
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,400
It’s fine, I’ll wait for you here.

741
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,320
No need to rush.

742
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,240
Okay

743
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,600
(I’m glad I got to see you today and hope we’ll meet again, Wan.)

744
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,480
(I’m glad I got to see you today and hope we’ll meet again, Wan.)

745
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,080
Pleng.

746
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,960
Pleng, what’s wrong?

747
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,640
Pleng!

748
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
I’m glad

749
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,720
I got to see you today, Wan.

750
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,560
I hope we’ll meet again.

751
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,640
Wan.

752
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,200
- Ek
- What are you doing here?

753
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,080
I’m here to shop.

754
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,360
And you?

755
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,600
I’m here for tutoring.

756
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,200
Diligent, huh?

757
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,360
More like forced.

758
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,560
Oh, by the way...

759
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,760
Did Pleng say anything to you that day?

760
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,600
You know Pleng too, Ek?

761
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,080
Well, she’s the one who answered my call.

762
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,000
But I kind of got the feeling

763
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,920
that she wasn’t too happy about me calling.

764
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,360
Because of her?

765
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,520
Is that why you didn’t answer my calls?

766
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,240
It’s not because of Pleng.

767
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,400
I’ve just been busy, that’s why I haven’t answered.

768
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,680
- I’ll be going now
- Bye-bye.

769
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,280
Pleng.

770
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,240
Are you really not going to listen to what I have to say?

771
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,200
If you won’t listen, I’m going to cry!

772
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,120
Stop being so dramatic, Wan. You’re an adult now.

773
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,120
But you’re not listening to me at all!

774
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,760
I’ve been trying to talk to you since last night, but you keep avoiding me.

775
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,840
Wan, Wan...

776
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
What are you doing?

777
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,960
I’m going to do this

778
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,920
until you talk to me.

779
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,840
Wan, aren’t you embarrassed in front of other people?

780
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,800
- Wan
- Not embarrassed.

781
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,680
I don’t care about anyone but you.

782
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,840
Listen, if you don’t get up right now,
I’m not going to talk to you for the rest of my life.

783
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
Ouch!

784
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,400
Wan, are you hurt?

785
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,800
Please, listen to me.

786
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,360
I’m begging you.

787
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,360
Let’s talk somewhere else.

788
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,720
What do you want to explain? Just say it.

789
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,120
You saw the text Ek sent, didn’t you?

790
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,280
What did you think it meant?

791
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,720
What do you want me to think it meant?

792
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,560
I just understood what I saw.

793
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,320
I understood that you lied.

794
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,920
You lied about going shopping, but in reality, you were meeting a guy.

795
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,920
Why did you lie to me?

796
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,560
I just told you that you’re the only true friend I have.

797
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,520
I knew you’d think that.

798
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,880
Listen to me, Pleng. I didn’t plan to meet Ek.

799
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,680
I ran into him by chance in front of the department store,

800
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,720
when I was waiting for a ride home.

801
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,640
How can I believe you?

802
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,920
I don’t know how to make you believe me.

803
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,640
But I swear, this is the truth.

804
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,000
We really didn’t plan to meet.

805
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,320
I haven’t even answered any of his calls.

806
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,160
That day, you answered the call for me, so you should already know.

807
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,520
Pleng.

808
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,840
Do you realize how contradictory you are?

809
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,880
Back at the gallery,

810
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,120
you told me that if I were to date someone,

811
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,160
Ek seemed like a good choice.

812
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,800
But now that Ek and I are actually getting to know each other,

813
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,120
you’re jealous.

814
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Wan.

815
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,120
What are you talking about?

816
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,000
You’re jealous, Pleng.

817
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,840
You’re jealous of me.

818
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,720
Are you crazy? Friends don’t get jealous.

819
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,120
They just get protective.

820
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,360
Whether it’s jealousy or protectiveness, I’m happy with it either way.

821
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,960
Wan.

822
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,440
I know that one day, in the future, we’ll both have our own families.

823
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,920
We’ll have our own partners.

824
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,680
But that time hasn’t come yet.

825
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,720
I’m not ready yet.

826
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,680
I still want you to see me as the most important person in your life.

827
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,320
I’m not ready.

828
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,960
But you’re already rushing to find me a partner.

829
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,640
So contradictory.

830
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,680
Wanwiwa.

831
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,040
Fine, I won’t tease you anymore.

832
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,480
But you know what, Pleng?

833
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,080
Even if one day I get married and have a husband...

834
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,920
Pleng will always be the most important person in my life.

835
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,960
No one will ever be more important than you.

836
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,440
You said it, now make sure you follow through.

837
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,000
Don’t just talk the talk.

838
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,160
I don’t just talk the talk.

839
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,640
I’m good at other things too.

840
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,440
Hey, Wan, don’t be cheeky.

841
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,000
- Don’t leave yet.
- I’m not jealous.

842
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,480
That’s what it is, Pleng. You’re jealous of me.

843
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
It’s called being protective, not jealous.

844
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,160
At first, I thought you were just really attached to your friend,

845
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,560
but who would’ve thought you’d be this protective.

846
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,080
Even when your friend just happened to run into a guy,

847
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,600
you got so mad.

848
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,840
Dad, it’s not like I was that angry.

849
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,160
Wan, you’re just making things up.

850
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,520
You’re really taking advantage of this, aren’t you?

851
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,440
Wi, could I have some medicine, please?

852
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,560
Yes, ma’am.

853
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
Are you full already?

854
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,400
You didn’t eat much.

855
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,520
Yes, after hearing about my daughter’s antics,

856
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,960
I lost my appetite.

857
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,280
Mom!

858
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,680
Careful now...

859
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,000
Not only will Wan not have a boyfriend,

860
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,080
but you won’t have one either.

861
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,840
Honey, you better get ready for this.

862
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,400
Our daughter

863
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,360
is going to live off us for the rest of her life.

864
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,800
In that case, we better hurry up and find her a boyfriend.

865
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,600
Yes, but who would it be?

866
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,720
How about Frank?

867
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,720
Hmm?

868
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,040
Oh wow, that guy?

869
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,600
He knows everything about our daughter already.

870
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,880
He knows that her personality

871
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,200
isn’t as pretty as her face.

872
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,440
Mom!

873
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,840
Well, it’s the truth.

874
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,720
But if it’s not Frank,

875
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,240
I can’t think of anyone else who’d fit.

876
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,360
I think Frank is the best choice.

877
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,600
I’m going to make Frank like me

878
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,400
and then be with me.

879
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,640
Mom and Dad, you better start thinking

880
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,600
about how much dowry you want for me.

881
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,400
I’m going to take a walk to help with digestion now.

882
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,400
Are you full already?

883
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
You weren’t really walking to help digest, were you?

884
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,120
Nope.

885
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,520
I just didn’t want to stay there.

886
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,240
I wasn’t feeling great.

887
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,480
What’s wrong with you?

888
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,160
Are you feeling unwell?

889
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,120
You don’t seem to have a fever.

890
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,240
So, what’s wrong with you?

891
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,080
Physically, it’s nothing much.

892
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,120
But my heart...

893
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,320
It feels kind of sick.

894
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,040
Why?

895
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,040
Because I don’t like it...

896
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,400
when you say you’ll be with Frank.

897
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,240
I’m jealous.

898
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,640
What?

899
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,960
I’m jealous of you, just like how you’re jealous of me.

900
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,560
You know I was just joking, right?

901
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,600
Huh?

902
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,280
There’s no way Frank and I will ever be together.

903
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,040
But you and Ek, on the other hand...

904
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,360
Wan.

905
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,600
Wan!

906
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,960
Wan isn’t here, Miss Pleng.

907
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,000
She just went out a moment ago.

908
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,200
Really? Where did she go, Aunt Wi?

909
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,600
I’m not sure.

910
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,600
I heard that her boyfriend came to pick her up.

911
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Boyfriend?

912
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,480
Yes.

913
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,080
Wan.

914
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,080
Wanwiwa.

915
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,920
Wan, I’m telling you to stop right now!

916
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,520
I said, stop!

917
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,600
Was I dreaming?

918
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,800
You’re going to do group work with friends?

919
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,280
So that means you won’t be going home with me today, right?

920
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,800
Yes.

921
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,880
And that group work you mentioned...

922
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,720
Who's going?

923
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,760
My classmates, of course.

924
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,920
Why?

925
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,080
Did you think I was going with someone else?

926
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,320
No, whoever you go with is your business.

927
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,520
You, Pleng...

928
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,120
You're jealous of me again, aren’t you?

929
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,240
Hey, I told you to use a different word!

930
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,040
I said "protective," not "jealous!"

931
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,640
Stop using that word already.

932
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,600
If someone else hears, they’ll get the wrong idea.

933
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,160
I don’t care what anyone else says.

934
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,520
I don’t care.

935
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,160
Wan, hurry, quick!

936
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,240
Let’s go to my house.

937
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,280
Wait for me!

938
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Hello, professor.

939
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,000
Sir, follow the car in front of us, please.

940
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,360
So, what else do we need?

941
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,440
There’s a lot, but we don’t have scissors yet.

942
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,760
Then let’s take these scissors.

943
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,000
Which one?

944
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:57,960
The purple one.

945
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,520
- Okay, grab the purple one.
- Cute!

946
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,920
But it's kind of pretentious.

947
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,880
Take some glue with us.

948
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,080
What else do we need?

949
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,000
Hello?

950
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,360
Have you reached your friend's house yet?

951
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,400
Not yet, I’m just stopping by to buy some supplies for the project.

952
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,800
Do you need something?

953
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,520
- No, nothing.
- Where are you right now?

954
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,280
Are you home yet?

955
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,520
Wan, I have to go now.

956
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,160
Wan.

957
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,480
Are you still wearing my bra?

958
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,920
It’s really old, you know.

959
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,000
Do you really like it that much?

960
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,800
An heirloom from me!

961
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,160
Yes, I like it a lot.

962
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,040
So, how should I repay the person who gave me a massage?

963
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,640
Your eyes look puffy. Did you not sleep?

964
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,920
Someone like you won’t stay annoyed with me for long.

965
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,920
You’ll come running back to me soon enough.

966
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,600
I hate you.

967
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,440
(Is this off-script?)

968
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,480
(She’s really blushing!)

969
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,280
I was just closing my eyes.

970
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,080
Closing my eyes, chanting “NaMo”
(Please don’t rain).

971
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,760
I didn’t even finish three times.

972
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,360
(Let me see.)

973
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,520
Do you want to play with it?

974
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,480
- You keep looking deeper and deeper
- I want to see.

975
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,040
Do you want to play with it?

976
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,520
Walk carefully!

977
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,080
Keep up!

978
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,520
(Such good care!)

979
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,960
A servant.

980
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,000
(Attacked from behind.)
