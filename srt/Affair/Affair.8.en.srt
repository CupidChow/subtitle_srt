1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Ek, don’t! Ek, stop!

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,200
Calm down and call an ambulance.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,800
You two are siblings, you share the same father.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,480
That’s not true, Aunt Wi, it’s not true!

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,880
Just the thought of it…

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,600
I can’t even…

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,800
I can’t look at you anymore.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,520
Please, just let me go.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,720
The DNA test results for Pleng and Wan.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,040
Pleng and Wan…

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,000
They’re not related by blood.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
I want to go to the tattoo shop.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,320
Do you have a design in mind?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,640
Where would you like the tattoo, miss?

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,920
Right here on this side, please.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
Please tell me…

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,920
I really want to see Wan.

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,400
If only I could see Wan…

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,720
I promise I won’t hurt Wan again.

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,920
Wait, Wan!

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,920
You…

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,880
What are you planning to do, Wan?

23
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,000
Why?

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,720
Come here!

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,880
What are you planning to do, Wan?

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,280
Are you going to leave me?

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
I’m sorry.

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,960
I’m sorry for being the one who hurt you.

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I’m sorry for being so selfish.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
I never cared about your feelings.

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,560
I won’t do it again.

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,960
I won’t let you leave me ever again.

33
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,360
If I didn’t show you the DNA test results…

34
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,160
You wouldn’t have come, right?

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
No, that’s not true.

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
Even without the DNA test results…

37
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,880
I would still have searched for you.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Even if I didn’t find you today…

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,240
I’m sure I will find you one day.

40
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,160
Because I love you.

41
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,160
Even if the test says…

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,160
We are siblings.

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,160
I don’t care about that anymore.

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,680
As long as I can be with you, that’s enough for me.

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Aren’t you afraid?

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
That if you came any later…

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,480
I might have already been dead?

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
Well, if that really happened...

49
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,160
I would die with you.

50
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,480
Are you crazy?

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,159
I won’t let you do that.

52
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,960
You won’t let me die…

53
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,280
But you were planning to die yourself?

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,240
Who said I was going to die?

55
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,040
I was just…

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,560
Going to dunk my face in the sea.

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,960
I’m just tired.

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,360
So tired that…

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,560
I don’t even know how to heal anymore.

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,960
Is it because of me?

61
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,560
Because of you.

62
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,480
And it’s also because of you…

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
That I feel less tired.

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
Just seeing your face…

65
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,560
Makes me feel so much better.

66
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
You…

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,480
Are you going to hurt me again?

68
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,440
No.

69
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,159
I’m sorry.

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,760
Let’s never part again, Wan.

71
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,960
You got a tattoo?

72
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
Since when?

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
How come I never saw it?

74
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,080
Just today.

75
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,560
Before you arrived.

76
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
You know what it means, right?

77
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,080
What it stands for?

78
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
Look at the sea.

79
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,080
It’s just as beautiful as when we came here as kids.

80
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
Do you understand now?

81
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,440
Why I wanted to honeymoon here?

82
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,360
Since we met here…

83
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,960
Let’s take the chance to honeymoon here too.

84
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,880
Where are you going?

85
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
To shower and grab breakfast, of course.

86
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,840
Do you even understand what a honeymoon is?

87
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
That’s not how honeymoons are supposed to be.

88
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,680
They’re supposed to go like this.

89
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,160
That’s enough, Wan. Let go.

90
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,160
Enough already.

91
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,960
You’re too obsessed with this.

92
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
And you don’t like it?

93
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,360
I do, but…

94
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,280
Marriage can’t be just about this.

95
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,160
It can be.

96
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,280
Because…

97
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,280
We’re newlyweds.

98
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,160
No one’s going to judge us.

99
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,160
That’s enough, Wan. Stop it.

100
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Is it delicious?

101
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,080
It’s good.

102
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
Do you think…

103
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,760
Are they watching us?

104
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
Why would they be watching?

105
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,040
Maybe they’re just curious.

106
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,680
Don’t worry about it.

107
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,160
Just finish your meal.

108
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,160
Once we’re done eating,

109
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,560
we’ll go for a walk.

110
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,280
Do you want to take a walk,

111
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,960
or…

112
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,160
Do you want to go back to the room?

113
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
Again, Wan?

114
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
That’s enough.

115
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,840
Let’s just eat.

116
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,680
May I sit with you?

117
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,960
What if I say no?

118
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,760
I’ll sit anyway.

119
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Frank…

120
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,560
I really appreciate it.

121
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,560
Thank you for taking care of Wan all this time.

122
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,160
And also…

123
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,680
Thank you for letting me see her.

124
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,080
Well…

125
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
It’s a brother’s duty.

126
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,760
I have to do this for my sister.

127
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,280
I’ve booked a dinner on a boat for you.

128
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,760
The sky will be clear tonight, and you’ll see all the stars.

129
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,680
You both will love it for sure.

130
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,360
We would love it, of course.

131
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,760
But we won’t get to see it.

132
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Because…

133
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,960
We’re heading back to Bangkok today.

134
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,280
Why?

135
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,760
Do you have something to do?

136
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,960
No, I don’t have anything.

137
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,360
But you…

138
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,960
Don’t you need to get back to work?

139
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
Can a doctor take so many days off?

140
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
It’s fine.

141
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,080
I’ve already cleared everything up.

142
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,480
But I agree with Wan.

143
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,680
Like…

144
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,880
There’s no need to rush back.

145
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,760
Stay for another day or two.

146
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,480
Is something wrong, Frank?

147
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,760
No, nothing.

148
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,960
That face…

149
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,880
I’ve seen that look since we were kids.

150
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,080
You’re not hiding it very well.

151
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,280
Just say what’s on your mind.

152
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,160
Is she the doctor whose husband shot himself?

153
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,040
The other woman was there too, right?

154
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,280
We watched that Live stream that day.

155
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,360
What a mess, what’s their deal anyway?

156
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,640
It’s pretty obvious, isn’t it?

157
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,080
Maybe that’s why her husband hurt himself.

158
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,880
You should sue the mistress, both of them!

159
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,480
Hit them with everything you’ve got.

160
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,280
What are you watching?

161
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,960
Let me see.

162
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
Have you seen this post? Come back ASAP.

163
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,440
Reporters are swarming the hospital, waiting to interview you.

164
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,960
What should we do now?

165
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Let’s go back.

166
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,760
Whatever happens, happens.

167
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
I don’t want any more problems.

168
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
I’ll be on standby here.

169
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
If you need anything,

170
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,960
just call me, don’t hesitate.

171
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,440
How will Ek handle this situation?

172
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,760
I respect Ek’s decision.

173
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
But listen…

174
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,560
We should sue those two women.

175
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
Look at what they’ve done.

176
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,880
They don’t seem to feel any guilt for what they did to our son.

177
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,480
We’ve pressured him enough already.

178
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,960
Let him make his own choices for once.

179
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
Thank you, Dad.

180
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,480
They’re here.

181
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,680
Sorry to bother you, but could we ask for an interview?

182
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,960
What exactly is the status of your relationship right now?

183
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,760
The viral pictures on social media—can you clarify, please?

184
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,079
Yes, what’s really going on?

185
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,280
- Please answer.
- Could you respond, please?

186
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,960
Are you two in a relationship right now?

187
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,680
The two of us…

188
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,880
are lovers.

189
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,640
- Wow, they’re lovers!
- Just like that?

190
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,280
Is this why your husband, Ek, harmed himself?

191
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,760
Because he saw you two together?

192
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,840
- Exactly.
- Is that true?

193
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,080
- Isn’t that right?
- Is it true or not?

194
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,760
Aren’t you two afraid that Ek will file for divorce against both of you?

195
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,760
Since you’re still his wife,

196
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,560
but secretly dating someone else.

197
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Have you thought about what will happen if he really sues you?

198
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,560
Let me answer that question.

199
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,760
- Oh, Ek!
- Ek, what do you have to say?

200
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
What will you say?

201
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,560
Dr. Wan and I…

202
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,360
We are still married.

203
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,360
But we’ve been living apart for a while now.

204
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,680
And we’ve already discussed getting a divorce.

205
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,160
This was before Dr. Wan met Pleng.

206
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,960
The only thing is, I haven’t signed the papers yet.

207
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,560
Because I wasn’t ready to accept it.

208
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,360
If I truly had to live without her.

209
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,080
So, I’ve decided…

210
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,960
I won’t sue Dr. Wan and Pleng.

211
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,880
Because they didn’t do anything wrong.

212
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,680
It’s just me who couldn’t accept the reality…

213
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,880
that Dr. Wan doesn’t love me anymore.

214
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,600
What will you do next, Ek?

215
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,760
- Yes, what’s your plan?
- How will you handle this?

216
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,880
After I leave the hospital…

217
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,960
I will sign the divorce papers for Dr. Wan right away.

218
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,880
And I ask that everyone stop reporting on me from now on.

219
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,560
Because, like I said…

220
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,560
No one is at fault for what happened.

221
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,680
There’s no blame to place on anyone.

222
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,160
It’s just love…

223
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,560
and not love.

224
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,960
That’s all.

225
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,560
May I take a picture?

226
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
That’s all for now.

227
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,360
Thank you, Ek.

228
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,760
Thank you so much, Ek.

229
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
From now on…

230
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,440
live your life happily.

231
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
If you ever feel troubled…

232
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
you can always come back to me.

233
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,840
I’ll always leave a place for you, Wan.

234
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,960
As a friend…

235
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,760
One of your best friends.

236
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,360
Would it be okay…

237
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
if I ask to hug you one more time, Ek?

238
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,000
Ek…

239
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,280
Don’t close yourself off, Ek.

240
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,560
I truly believe…

241
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,760
that there is someone out there who loves and waits for you, Ek.

242
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,280
Don’t forget to find your own Gemini.

243
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,680
What’s a Gemini?

244
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
Never mind if you don’t want to know.

245
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,680
But since you gave me your blessing…

246
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,080
I’ll hope for it to be true.

247
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,560
Go on…

248
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,440
Go to Pleng quickly.

249
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,160
Is something wrong, patient?

250
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
There’s nothing wrong with my foot.

251
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,080
It’s my head that hurts, not my foot.

252
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,560
I can see that.

253
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,640
But you’re not wearing any shoes.

254
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,360
Walking around barefoot like this,

255
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,240
if you don’t clean properly,

256
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,960
you might pick up some germs.

257
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
You risk getting an infection in your wound.

258
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,960
So I’ll clean it for you, okay?

259
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,160
Could you write a song for me, Pleng?

260
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,160
I want a song that you’ve written for me.

261
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,760
Thank you so much, Wan.

262
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
Wan!

263
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,080
Marry me, Pleng.

264
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,960
What is it?

265
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,880
It’s Aunt Wi, Wan.

266
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480
Mom!

267
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,680
Mom!

268
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,160
Mom, listen to me, please.

269
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,160
Please let me live my life with Pleng.

270
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,440
Ever since I was born,

271
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
I’ve never asked you for anything.

272
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,560
I’m only asking for this one thing.

273
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,080
Do whatever you want, it’s your life.

274
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,560
You don’t need to ask me for anything.

275
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,960
Aunt Wi…

276
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,360
I understand now.

277
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,880
Why you don’t like Pleng.

278
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,760
It’s because all this time…

279
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,840
you’ve thought, haven’t you…

280
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
that Wan and I are siblings?

281
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,560
And I…

282
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,960
have lived as the boss’s daughter.

283
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,360
While Wan…

284
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,680
has lived as the housekeeper’s daughter.

285
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,360
You felt resentful on Wan’s behalf…

286
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,640
and that’s why you’ve never liked me, right?

287
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,680
Aunt Wi…

288
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,280
I couldn’t choose the life I was born into.

289
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
If I could’ve chosen…

290
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,680
I wouldn’t have wanted to have more than Wan in any way.

291
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,880
I just want to be someone…

292
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,680
who was born to love Wan.

293
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,560
And to take care of Wan for the rest of my life, that’s all.

294
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,880
And today…

295
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,160
the truth has finally come to light.

296
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,080
Wan and I…

297
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,160
aren’t siblings.

298
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,080
And our social standing today isn’t any different.

299
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,480
So I want to ask Aunt Wi for a chance.

300
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,160
To open your heart…

301
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,480
and let Wan and I…

302
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
love each other.

303
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,680
You don’t have to be kind to me, Aunt Wi.

304
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,280
But please don’t stop Wan and I from loving each other.

305
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,640
I promise you, Aunt Wi.

306
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,360
I will love Wan.

307
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,160
I will love her more than I ever have.

308
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,840
I will do everything to make Wan happy.

309
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Even if I have to risk my life,

310
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
I will.

311
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,160
Please let me love Wan.

312
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,360
The fact that I’m here watching you play music today…

313
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,440
should be an answer in itself.

314
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,960
About how I feel.

315
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,960
Mom…

316
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
Keep your promise, okay?

317
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,560
I’ll be watching.

318
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,080
I’m off work early today.

319
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,480
Let’s go see a movie.

320
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,680
My talented artist.

321
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,360
I can’t go.

322
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,240
You’re off early…

323
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,680
but I don’t even know when I’ll finish.

324
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,080
I’m recording a song today.

325
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,480
It’s the last one…

326
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,840
before the album is done.

327
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,160
What?!

328
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,880
We’ve been married for almost a month now.

329
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
And we’ve never gone anywhere together.

330
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,560
I’ve just been really busy.

331
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,760
And I’ve been so tired.

332
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,760
Tired, but still smiling?

333
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,680
Becoming an artist was my dream.

334
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,760
It was so hard for me to get here.

335
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,480
I had to struggle so much.

336
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,360
And now that I’ve achieved it…

337
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,880
I need to give it my all.

338
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,080
And what about me?

339
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,159
It wasn’t easy for you to get me either.

340
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,880
You struggled just as much, didn’t you?

341
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,280
Don’t you want to give me your all, too?

342
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,159
What’s wrong, Wan?

343
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,960
Why are you being so dramatic?

344
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,159
Pleng, I’m feeling neglected here.

345
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,280
I want you to make some time for me.

346
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,280
I want us to spend more time together.

347
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,159
We sleep together every night.

348
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,679
And we see each other every morning

349
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,679
Isn’t that enough, Doctor?

350
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,000
If I had known, I wouldn’t have married you.

351
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,360
I should’ve just left you with your music. That would’ve been better.

352
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,360
That would’ve been better.

353
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,360
Oh no! Did you see that, Dr. Guy?

354
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,440
Don’t let Dr. Wan find out about this!

355
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
She just told us today, right?

356
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,680
They actually seem pretty sweet together.

357
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,080
If Dr. Wan sees this, she’ll flip for sure.

358
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
The ward will be in chaos.

359
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,560
What are you all watching?

360
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,640
Oh, nothing, just some random celebrity gossip.

361
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,960
Don’t worry about it.

362
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,360
Don’t give me that.

363
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,160
Seriously, there’s nothing, Doctor.

364
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,480
Quick, let’s go.

365
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,360
Their chemistry is amazing.

366
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,280
I wish they weren’t just a producer and an artist.

367
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,160
Agreed, I’m ready to ship them!

368
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
Total ship material.

369
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,360
Calm down, ladies.

370
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,360
Pleng is already married.

371
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,560
What a shame!

372
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,560
Too bad she’s with a woman.

373
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,360
She’d be better off with a guy.

374
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,160
What’s up, Doctor?

375
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,680
Where are you?

376
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,040
Why didn’t you answer your phone?

377
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,880
I was in the recording studio.

378
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,480
I already told you that.

379
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,680
Are you done yet?

380
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,960
Yeah, I’m done.

381
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
- In that case...
- But...

382
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,040
I’m probably not coming home yet, Wan.

383
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,280
It’s just that…

384
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,880
My team invited me to celebrate the album’s completion.

385
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,280
This is too much, Pleng.

386
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,760
You can go party with others,

387
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,960
but you can’t go to the movies with me?

388
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,480
Is that fair?

389
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,360
Wan!

390
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,560
But this is the celebration for my album release.

391
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,360
It’s my first album!

392
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,680
Shouldn’t I go?

393
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,160
Plus, I’m still really new to this industry.

394
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,560
Shouldn’t I try not to refuse anyone?

395
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,160
Fine, in that case...

396
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,760
When I get back, I’ll make it up to you, okay?

397
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,880
I’ll take you to watch two movies, and…

398
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,480
How about we go to the beach too?

399
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Not good enough.

400
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,560
It has to be three movies.

401
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,080
OK.

402
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Three it is.

403
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,960
Then we’ll watch until our eyes hurt.

404
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,280
And…

405
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,280
Who are you going to the party with?

406
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,160
Is Earth going too?

407
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,160
Well…

408
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,160
See you at the place, Pleng. I shared the location with you.

409
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,160
Got it!

410
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,560
I’m heading out now, okay?

411
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,760
I’ll drive there first.

412
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,360
I’ll call you when I get there, bye-bye!

413
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,240
Hey, Pleng!

414
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,360
Calm down, will you?

415
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,880
What’s wrong with you?

416
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,960
You’re in the way.

417
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,760
What’s her deal?

418
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,240
What’s wrong with Dr. Wan?

419
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,760
Probably stressed about that video from this morning.

420
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Or maybe…

421
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,160
it’s her period.

422
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,480
With those symptoms, it’s probably both.

423
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Pack it up.

424
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,080
What time is it?

425
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,960
(Pleng)

426
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,760
It’s late, don’t you think it’s time to head back?

427
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,440
Wan?

428
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,880
Who is this?

429
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,480
How did you get Pleng's phone?

430
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,040
It’s me, Earth.

431
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,440
Pleng is drunk.

432
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,960
She couldn’t talk, so she handed me the phone.

433
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,280
And why you?

434
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,880
Isn’t there anyone else?

435
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,080
Anyone else?

436
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Who do you mean?

437
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,880
Someone else from the team who went with you.

438
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,640
Someone who’s a woman.

439
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,880
My team is all guys.

440
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,640
And everyone else already left.

441
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,560
It’s just me and Pleng left.

442
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,040
I’m asking you to take Pleng home to her condo.

443
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,080
Quickly, before I come there myself.

444
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,160
Come here.

445
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,960
What?

446
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,080
Oh, I thought it was someone else.

447
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,680
It’s my beautiful Dr. Wan.

448
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
How did you get so drunk like this?

449
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Drunk? Who, me?

450
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,280
Thank you for bringing Pleng home.

451
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,160
It’s no problem at all.

452
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,680
People on social media are shipping me with Pleng right now.

453
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,080
So of course I had to take care of my shipmate.

454
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,480
Easy task.

455
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,880
Exactly.

456
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,960
You’re just a ship, not the real thing.

457
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,560
You don’t need to take care of her so well.

458
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,240
I was just joking, calm down.

459
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,880
No need to get so upset.

460
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,360
Who said you could joke with me?

461
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,040
Exactly.

462
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,960
Come here.

463
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,480
Wan!

464
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,480
What?

465
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,760
- Hey!
- Thank you very much.

466
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,760
I have my first album thanks to you.

467
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,360
Next time…

468
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,360
I’ll treat you to something in return.

469
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,760
How about shutting down a bar for the night?

470
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,840
Once is more than enough.

471
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,360
You almost killed me with your words just now.

472
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,280
I’m shaking in fear.

473
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,560
Exactly.

474
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,080
Bye-bye.

475
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,520
What’s this?

476
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,120
How can you be this drunk?

477
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,680
Walk properly, will you?

478
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,680
Look at me.

479
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,080
Shipmates…

480
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,480
Shipmates…

481
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,480
Shipmates, huh?

482
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,960
Shipmates.

483
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,760
How did I get back to the room?

484
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,280
Your “shipmate” brought you back.

485
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,480
Earth, right?

486
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
Seriously,

487
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,960
What’s the deal between you and Earth?

488
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,440
Come on, Wan.

489
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
Social media is just social media.

490
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,320
You know what real life is like.

491
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,680
You know that well.

492
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,360
Don’t pay attention to it.

493
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,560
It’s not like I want to care.

494
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,360
I just don’t get it.

495
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,360
Why are you so close to him anyway?

496
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,040
Are there no other people you can be friends with?

497
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,760
I don’t have many friends.

498
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,760
Who else should I hang out with?

499
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,760
Then find some.

500
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,480
You’re famous now.

501
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,080
It shouldn’t be hard to make new friends.

502
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,560
And maybe make some female friends.

503
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,640
You’re surrounded by guys.

504
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,640
Your whole team, your producer.

505
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,360
What’s with that?

506
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,360
Wan…

507
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,880
That’s harsh.

508
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
What’s harsh about it?

509
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,560
Look at you, you don’t even feel guilty.

510
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,160
And what should I feel guilty about?

511
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,480
I haven’t done anything wrong, Wan.

512
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,840
You’re the one who’s overly jealous without reflecting on yourself.

513
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,280
I work with men because of my job.

514
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,480
But you— you were married to a man.

515
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,360
And when we fought, you ran off to the sea.

516
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,680
And stayed with a man.

517
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,480
I didn’t feel anything about that.

518
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,840
Is that how you want to play it?

519
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,680
Yeah, that’s exactly how.

520
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,880
Fine, I’ll show you.

521
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,880
Let’s see if you truly don’t feel anything.

522
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,640
Please stop being mad, okay?

523
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,640
I don’t want to fight with you anymore.

524
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,040
I love you.

525
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,360
I’m going into Bangkok today.

526
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,480
Want to meet up?

527
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,120
Come meet me here.

528
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,280
I knew someone like you…

529
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,160
couldn’t stay mad at me for long.

530
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,360
And how’s the lady doing?

531
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,960
She’s doing well.

532
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,360
The village misses Wan.

533
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,560
We’ll meet up soon.

534
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,760
Pleng.

535
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,560
This is Nueng.

536
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,480
M.L. Sippakorn.

537
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,840
My friend.

538
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,960
Nice to meet you, Pleng.

539
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,160
You already had plans with someone else.

540
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,640
So why ask to meet me too?

541
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,280
I’m not just anyone.

542
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,480
Wan and I…

543
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,080
have been special to each other for a long time.

544
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,960
How special are we talking?

545
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,480
Probably not as much as me.

546
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,280
Because I’m Wan’s girlfriend.

547
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,560
Is that so?

548
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,680
In that case,

549
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,360
let me give you a little warning.

550
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,960
You better take good care of your girlfriend.

551
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,760
And don’t let go of her again.

552
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,360
Just know,

553
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,280
there’s always someone waiting to step in.

554
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,560
Well, you’ll have to get through me first.

555
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,040
Wan.

556
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,240
Let’s go.

557
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,560
Hurry up.

558
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,560
Okay.

559
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,280
I was just thinking about you.

560
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,040
Talking about thinking of someone else,

561
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,680
you better watch out for a jealous girlfriend.

562
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,680
Funny enough,

563
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,960
I kind of want that to happen.

564
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,560
Can you help me out, Nueng?

565
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,640
Sure.

566
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,280
Why wouldn’t I help a friend out with something like this?

567
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,560
Besides,

568
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,280
breaking up a home...

569
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,160
I’m good at it. It’s fun.

570
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,280
You’re so cruel for doing this to me.

571
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,160
You think just because I love you,

572
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,760
you can do whatever you want to me?

573
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,560
Well, you did it to me first.

574
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,200
Do you feel it now?

575
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,400
After all of this, if you don’t feel it, you must be crazy.

576
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,520
But no matter what,

577
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,160
I’m not letting this slide so easily.

578
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,000
And what are you going to do?

579
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,520
Get back at me?

580
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,320
No.

581
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,640
But I’m going to punish you.

582
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,680
Bring it on.

583
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,080
You can’t do it.

584
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,200
Why can’t I?

585
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,480
Because I’m drunk.

586
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,040
And I’m sleepy too.

587
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,760
I’m going to sleep.

588
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,680
Wan!

589
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,960
Wan!

590
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,880
So this is how you want it, huh?

591
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,360
That hurts!

592
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,280
Come here.

593
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,760
I was just pretending to sleep a little,

594
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,080
and you stopped already?

595
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,840
Guess you’re not that bold after all.

596
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,680
This is the first time in 13 years…

597
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,760
that we’ve looked at the stars together again.

598
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,160
Do you know…

599
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,560
why I love the Gemini constellation so much?

600
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,080
Enough to get it tattooed?

601
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,560
Because…

602
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,560
Gemini…

603
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,560
represents the two of us.

604
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,760
That’s right.

605
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,280
But…

606
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,480
it has an even deeper meaning.

607
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,880
Actually,

608
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,480
Gemini is always in the sky.

609
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,880
But we can only see it at certain times.

610
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,760
Only visible at night,

611
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,360
and only clearly during certain months.

612
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,760
But every time it appears,

613
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,240
it’s always together.

614
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,160
Never separated.

615
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,680
Just like our love.

616
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,360
That never disappears from each other.

617
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,960
Thank you so much, Pleng.

618
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,560
Thank you.

619
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,080
For being born to be together.

620
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,960
Thank you too, Wan.

621
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,280
I love you.

622
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,880
I love you too.

623
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,440
The weather’s so nice.

624
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,320
(What time is “nice” anyway?) It’s 7 a.m. weather.

625
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,680
Look at Mhee’s arm.

626
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,160
Congrats!

627
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,000
We got here at noon.

628
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,480
Tanned girl vibes.

629
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,040
Instead of pale.

630
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,840
(Caring to the max)

631
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,800
Hold on tight!

632
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,720
No, don’t! I’m scared of heights.

633
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,280
Gemini stars.

634
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,320
(Lonely, it’s obvious)
But right now, I’m still single.

635
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,520
My other half isn’t here yet.

636
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,040
(Awkward af)
My hair…

637
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,040
I didn’t even touch it!

638
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,080
(The crew is working hard)

639
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,320
(Turned into survivors now lol)
