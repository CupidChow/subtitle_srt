1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,560
You have the flu.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,600
You’ll probably need to stay in the hospital for another 2-3 days.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,640
Does this hospital have…

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,720
A doctor named Wanwiwa?

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,120
Yes, we do.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
The 13 years you disappeared...

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,720
Why are you in this condition now?

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,480
Hurry and move your things out.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,240
I’m giving you 2 more days.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,600
Come back and stay with me, Pleng.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
Your room is full of things I like.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,520
Be careful, I might stay with you for a long time.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,520
I could stay for a lifetime.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,720
-I'm off to work now.
-I'll wait for you to come back and have dinner together.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,240
Aren’t we having dinner?

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,240
I’d rather have something else.

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,520
Pleng?

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,520
Is that you, Ek?

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
It really is Pleng!

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
It’s been a long time.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
How have you been?

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,720
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
I’m here to see Wan.

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,160
And how did you know Wan is here?

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,160
Of course I know, I used to be here with Wan before.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
So…

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,800
You’re here to see Wan too, Pleng?

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,520
I’m not here to see her.

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
But I’m staying here with Wan.

30
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,120
Well, that’s great then.

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,400
If you’re staying with Wan,

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,200
you can help me.

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Because right now, I’m completely lost.

34
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,520
What do you mean?

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,320
Help you with what?

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,400
Wan just broke up with me.

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,120
-and now...
-why did you come here again?

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
Can we talk first, Wan?

39
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,800
Talk about what?

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,200
I already told you, it's over.

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
Stop being so stubborn.

42
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,520
Let’s go, Pleng, we go upstairs.

43
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,600
I was afraid you’d be hungry.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
Wan.

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
What’s going on between you and Ek?

46
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
And what did Ek tell you?

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
Ek said...

48
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,320
He used to stay here with you.

49
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,520
And you broke up with him.

50
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,240
That’s all he said?

51
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,720
Well, that’s how it was.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
So, you and Ek were really together?

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,000
Why didn’t you ever tell me about this?

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
Because it ended a long time ago.

55
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,200
I didn’t see the point in bringing it up.

56
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,720
And...

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
What kind of problems did you two have?

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,920
Why did you break up?

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,520
Ek cheated on me.

60
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,200
To be honest,

61
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,000
I was at fault too.

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,200
How so?

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,920
I didn’t love Ek.

64
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,200
I never loved him from the start.

65
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,400
If you didn’t love Ek,

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,320
then why did you date him?

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,200
Didn’t you say yourself,

68
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,920
that you wanted me to be with Ek?

69
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,120
I didn’t have to love him.

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,800
Just date him, that’s all.

71
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
Because Ek was the best match for me.

72
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
Don’t you remember?

73
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,120
Wan.

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,720
Let it go, Pleng.

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,520
Just think of it as one of my life’s mistakes.

76
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,880
And let’s not talk about it anymore.

77
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
Understand?

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,400
It’s strange, isn’t it?

79
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,440
You’re not the same Pleng I used to know.

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,800
Normally, you wouldn’t let things go so easily.

81
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,600
You’d keep pushing until I told you everything.

82
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Why are you letting it go now that you’ve grown up?

83
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, I’m not the same Pleng anymore.

84
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
This Pleng...

85
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,520
has nothing left to fight you with.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,120
If I were as demanding as before,

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,200
what would I do if you kicked me out to sleep on the street?

88
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
How could you think like that?

89
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
Who knows?

90
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,320
It’s been so long since we’ve seen each other.

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,320
You might’ve become more ruthless.

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,200
Look at you!

93
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,200
You barely even smile anymore.

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,040
That’s because I didn’t have you before.

95
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,520
But now, I have you.

96
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,840
I’ll go back to being the same Wan.

97
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
The one who loves you,

98
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,640
no matter what you’re like.

99
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,800
So,

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
you should go back to being the same Pleng.

101
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
It suits you better.

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
If you had loved Ek

103
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,800
as much as you loved me,

104
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Ek wouldn’t have cheated on you.

105
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,800
And the two of you...

106
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,120
wouldn’t have broken up.

107
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,800
It’s not that I didn’t try.

108
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,120
But I just couldn’t.

109
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,000
Maybe...

110
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
Maybe I was born to...

111
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,520
love only you.

112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,720
I’m off to work now.

113
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,520
Text me on Line when you wake up.

114
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,240
Don’t tell me the phone’s broken.

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,120
And I don’t even have money to buy a new one.

116
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,800
I’m awake now.

117
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,320
You don’t need to play at the bar anymore.

118
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,720
I’ve found a new band to replace you.

119
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,800
That’s all I can give you,

120
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,400
because you’ve been gone for days.

121
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,400
I’m going out today.

122
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,880
Did the message send?

123
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,920
Tod, Tod, Tod.

124
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Do you think that person is Pleng?

125
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Pleng? Which Pleng?

126
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you.

127
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,400
-Are you still playing music?
-Pleng.

128
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,920
Why do you look so confused, Pleng?

129
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,800
Pleng.

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,440
Why do you look so worn out?

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Pleng.

132
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,480
-Pleng.
-Where are you going, Pleng?

133
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
Pleng.

134
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,280
Oh, that’s really scary.

135
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
-Pleng.
-Pleng.

136
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Pleng.

137
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,800
Pleng, get in the car.

138
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Pleng.

139
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Hurry up.

140
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,320
That’s enough, we’ve probably got the right person.

141
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
Who are those two?

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,680
Friends from school, back when I was a kid.

143
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
It’s such a small world.

144
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,120
So why did you run away?

145
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,600
Just look at me right now.

146
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,000
I’m in no shape to see anyone.

147
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
I’m not the rich girl I used to be.

148
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,880
My life now is just being a poor girl

149
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,200
who has to play music on the street to make a living.

150
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,600
I get it.

151
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,200
But, seriously...

152
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,040
How did you even find me?

153
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
I...

154
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,600
I’ve been following you since the condo.

155
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,520
Why were you following me?

156
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
Don’t tell me…

157
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,920
you want my help with Wan?

158
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,000
If that's what you're thinking, just drop it.

159
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,600
We’ve all grown up now, Ek.

160
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,080
We each have our own way of thinking.

161
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,400
Wan doesn’t listen to me like before anymore.

162
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Calm down.

163
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,480
I didn’t come because of that.

164
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,120
I came to see you.

165
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,920
I wanted to know how you’re doing.

166
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,200
It’s been so long.

167
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,120
Why do you even care?

168
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Maybe you need help.

169
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,120
If there’s anything I can do for you,

170
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,720
I’ll help.

171
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,400
Because you’re Wan’s friend.

172
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,920
So that makes you my friend too.

173
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,880
There’s really nothing special about my life.

174
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,200
I’ve been on my own for a long time.

175
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
I can handle it.

176
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,800
And I don’t need anyone’s help.

177
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Maybe you should calm down a bit.

178
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,720
I think you might need my help, you know.

179
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,000
Why did you bring me here?

180
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,120
This is one of my family’s hotels.

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And so?

182
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,480
Well, I...

183
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,720
I’d like you to play music here.

184
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,920
I think it’s better than busking on the streets.

185
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,400
You’ll have it easier,

186
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,320
and you’ll make more money.

187
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Maybe

188
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,400
it could also give you a chance to make connections with other people.

189
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,520
A lot of people from the entertainment industry like to hang out here.

190
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,920
If they see your talent,

191
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,320
they might offer you some work.

192
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,920
Wan once told me

193
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,720
that you wanted to be a famous artist, right?

194
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,720
This could be a good starting point.

195
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,720
You don’t need to give me an answer right away.

196
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,600
Go home and think about it.

197
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,520
Once you’ve decided,

198
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
just let me know.

199
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,000
Add me on Line.

200
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,280
Don’t you have a business card?

201
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you sure

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,400
that you’re helping me without expecting anything in return?

203
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,440
You know...

204
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
I did hope for something.

205
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
But if not, it’s fine.

206
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,680
I just wanted to help as a friend should.

207
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,119
Oh, Wan!

208
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,319
What’s wrong?

209
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,720
I’m stressed.

210
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,720
I was afraid you wouldn’t come back.

211
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,520
Why would you think that?

212
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,720
Didn’t you get my message?

213
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,200
I did.

214
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,320
But I couldn’t reach you.

215
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,320
So I started overthinking everything.

216
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
I’m sorry, Wan.

217
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,000
I’m back now.

218
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,920
Don’t let the past

219
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,800
hurt your heart anymore.

220
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,000
By the way…

221
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,200
Where did you go?

222
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,200
I went to look for a job.

223
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
The owner of that place kicked me out.

224
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,800
And did you find one?

225
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
If you didn’t, it’s okay.

226
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,080
You don’t need to work.

227
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,400
I can take care of you.

228
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,920
I’m totally fine.

229
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,600
I found one.

230
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,800
I’m going to play piano at a hotel.

231
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,600
Which hotel?

232
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,920
Pleng...

233
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
Wan...

234
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I won’t let you do it.

235
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,200
You don’t have to go at all.

236
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,600
Wan...

237
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,800
But opportunities like this

238
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,720
don’t come around often, Wan.

239
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,400
When Ek invited you,

240
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,200
didn’t you see...

241
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,280
what he was trying to do?

242
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
Of course I did.

243
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
Ek probably wants me to help him with you.

244
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,800
But do you really think

245
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,440
I could help Ek?

246
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Here’s the thing.

247
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,200
Let’s say

248
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I actually helped Ek.

249
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,800
Would you go back to him?

250
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,000
No.

251
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,200
See?

252
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,680
No matter what anyone does,

253
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,720
you wouldn’t go back to Ek.

254
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,400
So,

255
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,400
Don’t worry, Wan.

256
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,720
Let me work there, okay?

257
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,320
I’ll have a job and earn money.

258
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,920
Please don’t make me feel like

259
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
being with you

260
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,800
makes me a burden to you.

261
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
You know I have issues with this.

262
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,720
With that approach,

263
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
I guess I have to give in to you, huh?

264
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,320
Thank you, Wan.

265
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,200
Can I borrow your phone?

266
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
I’ll call Ek and tell him I agree.

267
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,320
No need.

268
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,200
I’ll handle it myself.

269
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
Honestly, I don’t agree with this.

270
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Because I know what you’re trying to do.

271
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,520
But if it’s what Pleng wants,

272
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,120
I’ll accept it.

273
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,280
I just hope she’ll be happy with her job.

274
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,600
And I also hope

275
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,200
that between you and Pleng,

276
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,520
it will only be about work.

277
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,400
Ek, don’t even think about dragging Pleng

278
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,400
into our issues.

279
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,120
Wan!

280
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,720
We’ll never go back to how we were, will we, Wan?

281
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,520
Don’t try anymore, Ek.

282
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,000
It will only hurt Ek more.

283
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
Trust me.

284
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,720
So, there’s nothing we can do?

285
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
The only thing Ek can do

286
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,400
is follow my advice.

287
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Let me know when you’re ready.

288
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,920
I’ll be waiting.

289
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,600
Today is our anniversary, Wan.

290
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,800
Can’t you finish work a bit earlier?

291
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,280
I’m a doctor, you know.

292
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,920
I still have patients.

293
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,880
Personal matters can wait.

294
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,720
I’ve got to go, I’m busy right now.

295
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,720
Waiter.

296
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
Ek.

297
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Wan.

298
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,520
Wan, listen to me first.

299
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
I can’t believe it.

300
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,800
That you would do something so disgusting.

301
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,120
How could you do this?

302
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
I’m sorry.

303
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,520
-I didn’t mean to.
-Whether you meant to or not, you still did it.

304
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,120
I’m lonely.

305
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,000
Wan never cared about me.

306
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,400
We were in the same room,

307
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,800
but barely spoke.

308
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,400
We almost never went out together.

309
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Even when we slept together,

310
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,600
it was so rare we could count the times.

311
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,880
And it usually only happened when Wan was drunk.

312
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,000
Even today,

313
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
it’s our anniversary,

314
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,320
and Wan still doesn’t care about it.

315
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
I don’t even know, Wan,

316
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,120
where I fit into your life.

317
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,880
Am I really that worthless to you?

318
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,400
Let me ask you something.

319
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
Did you ever love me, Wan?

320
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,800
If I’m hurting you this much...

321
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,320
I think it’s better if we break up.

322
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,800
No, Wan, no! I don’t want to break up!

323
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,120
Let me go, Ek! I said let go!

324
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,600
I’m serious, Ek.

325
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,000
I don’t want to be the reason you’re like this.

326
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Hurting so much that you lose control,

327
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
doing things you shouldn’t be doing.

328
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
You’re the only one who will end up hurt,

329
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,120
not me.

330
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,360
I won’t accept that, Wan.

331
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,440
I’ll make sure you come back to me.

332
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,440
Is something wrong?

333
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,320
You look stressed today.

334
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,640
I bought this for you.

335
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,360
Pleng...

336
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,040
You bought it for me?

337
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,880
Now you can finally get rid of that crappy phone.

338
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
But this one is really expensive.

339
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,520
You didn’t have to go all out and buy this for me.

340
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,320
I bought it for peace of mind.

341
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,720
So you won’t lose contact like last time.

342
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Thank you.

343
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,240
You’re welcome.

344
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,440
That’s no problem at all.

345
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,400
But...

346
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
You can only use it to talk to me, okay?

347
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,520
No talking to anyone else.

348
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,920
You’re joking!

349
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,520
My life doesn’t revolve around just you.

350
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,560
I have work to do.

351
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,120
So…

352
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,520
How did it go talking to Ek?

353
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,760
When can I start working?

354
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,040
Tomorrow.

355
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,800
What’s wrong, Wan?

356
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
You’re still not okay with this, are you?

357
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,960
That I have to work with Ek.

358
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,040
Just a little bit.

359
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,840
So...

360
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,040
What do I need to do

361
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,640
for you to be okay with it?

362
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,040
I don’t know.

363
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,840
"Now you can finally get rid of that crappy phone."

364
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,840
"So you won’t lose contact like last time."

365
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,920
Hello, Dr. Wan.

366
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,440
This is a message sent from this phone.

367
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,120
The owner wanted me to tell you

368
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,880
she doesn’t know how to make it up to you.

369
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,520
So that you’ll be okay.

370
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,800
She’s not very good at apologizing.

371
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,840
She didn’t want to just say the short phrase that

372
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,040
she loves you.

373
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,920
The word ‘love,’

374
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,040
it’s not something you say through a text message.

375
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,920
You have to say it face to face.

376
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,440
That’s how you know if it’s real love.

377
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,520
I love you.

378
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,320
Can’t sleep, Pleng?

379
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,640
Don’t use that pretend-to-sleep trick from when we were kids.

380
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,040
I’m not stupid.

381
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,320
Pleng...

382
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,720
Pleng!

383
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,640
I brought this for you.

384
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,160
What is it?

385
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,120
So you can wear it for your performance.

386
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,240
I think it suits you

387
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,040
more than what you’re wearing now.

388
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,800
No thanks, it’s too much.

389
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,320
It’s okay, really.

390
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,920
I think you’ll benefit from it.

391
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,639
Then just deduct it from my pay.

392
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,760
I don’t like taking things for free.

393
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,719
But you’re staying at Wan’s condo for free, aren’t you?

394
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,719
I mean… what I’m trying to say is,

395
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,639
Wan and I are like one and the same person.

396
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,639
So, you don’t need to feel bad about it.

397
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,840
I’ve heard from Wan that you’re really talented.

398
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,640
But I didn’t think you’d be this talented.

399
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
You’re amazing.

400
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,520
Thanks so much.

401
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,000
I feel like...

402
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,440
I’m finally myself again.

403
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,640
Wan...

404
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,120
Wan, Wan!

405
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,320
Calm down, Wan.

406
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,120
You have no right to treat Pleng like this.

407
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
I didn’t do anything!

408
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,720
I was just congratulating her.

409
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,440
Congratulating her, really?

410
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,920
Did you have to get so touchy-feely?

411
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,440
I get it, you want to impress the guests.

412
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,640
But Pleng is a respectable woman,

413
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,040
not like the women you’ve taken home before.

414
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,440
That’s harsh, Wan.

415
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,920
So, whatever you do, keep it within limits.

416
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,920
Let’s go home.

417
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,120
Pleng can’t leave yet.

418
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,040
She’s still on the clock.

419
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,720
She needs to finish her work.

420
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,920
Afraid of losing your benefits?

421
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,240
Wan!

422
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,720
Compensation.

423
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,040
If it’s not enough, just ask for more, and I’ll transfer it to you.

424
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
I think you went too far, Wan.

425
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,920
Are we going to have problems with others now?

426
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,920
No, we’re not.

427
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,040
I’m trying to bring you to your senses.

428
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,720
I want you to use reason,

429
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
not just act on your emotions like that.

430
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,240
But I don’t like it.

431
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,120
I don’t like anyone touching you.

432
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,720
Wan.

433
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,440
That’s part of my job.

434
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,560
But I’m protective.

435
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,520
Are you protective of me or of Ek?

436
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,040
Are you crazy?

437
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,800
Why would I be protective of Ek?

438
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,920
Well, there are plenty of other better ways to express it.

439
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,440
Like what?

440
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,040
How about not coming to see me at the hotel anymore?

441
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,120
Absolutely not.

442
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,040
Wait a second, Wan.

443
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,920
I don’t know what else to do anymore.

444
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,040
But I don’t want you to do that again.

445
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,640
I don’t want people to think badly of you.

446
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,120
I don’t think that’s the case.

447
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
You just feel sorry for Ek.

448
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,320
That’s true.

449
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
I do feel sorry for Ek.

450
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,920
But Ek...

451
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,240
is not as important as you.

452
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,120
Where are you going?

453
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,000
I’m going to take a shower.

454
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,320
So then...

455
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,640
Can I join you in the shower?

456
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Wan.

457
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,720
You’re too slow, not quick enough for me.

458
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,040
I’m sorry.

459
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,920
For making you lose your job.

460
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,640
Who said I lost my job?

461
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,640
Ek just messaged me and told me

462
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,520
I can come back to work.

463
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,920
But I don’t want you to work there.

464
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,840
Can you find a new job?

465
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,040
I’ll help you look.

466
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,720
No way.

467
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,840
Do you think finding a job is easy these days?

468
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,720
I’ve been through job hunting on my own.

469
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,640
I know how hard it really is.

470
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,840
You graduated and became a doctor right away.

471
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,200
You wouldn’t understand.

472
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,240
Fine.

473
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,640
I’ll let you work there.

474
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,920
But you need to conduct yourself well.

475
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,320
Don’t let anyone get too close to you like that again.

476
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,000
Wan.

477
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,040
I think…

478
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,320
You shouldn’t be so harsh on Ek.

479
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,320
After all, you two used to be together.

480
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,440
And Ek really loves you.

481
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,400
If it were another guy,

482
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,240
and you treated him like that,

483
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,320
he wouldn’t just let you go.

484
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,120
Come here.

485
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,240
Wan.

486
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,120
Stop talking about other people.

487
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,440
The reason I asked you to stay with me

488
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,720
is because I want us to spend time together.

489
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,440
Can you just focus on us?

490
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,960
Okay.

491
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,120
From now on, I won’t talk about anyone else.

492
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,040
You’re so sweet.

493
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,320
What are you doing, Wan?

494
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,120
Wan, stop it.

495
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,240
I just miss you.

496
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,720
Wan, no, stop it.

497
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,600
Wan.

498
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,640
Wan.

499
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,320
Why?

500
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,040
I know you like it.

501
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,040
How do you know?

502
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,040
Well…

503
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,720
Something in your body told me.

504
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,320
What?

505
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,640
Like this.

506
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,720
You’ve got goosebumps.

507
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,240
But it’s wet,

508
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,120
so it’s hard to tell.

509
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,320
Stop messing around, you.

510
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,240
I’m getting out.

511
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,800
Why are you sleeping here?

512
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,800
Well...

513
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,080
I was afraid my arm might hit your face again.

514
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,200
But I’m not afraid.

515
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,720
Let me sleep with you.

516
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,480
Wan.

517
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,400
-Move over a bit.
-Wan.

518
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,600
Wan, it’s uncomfortable.

519
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,920
Wan.

520
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,720
Let me sleep with you, just stay still.

521
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,160
-Pleng.
-Wan.

522
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,600
Ouch!

523
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,400
When are you going to stop teasing me?

524
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,480
Teasing about what?

525
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,680
Well...

526
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,280
Teasing me, making me feel things.

527
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,480
Feel what?

528
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,200
Well...

529
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,000
Feel...

530
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,600
If you don’t stop,

531
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,080
I’m going to lose my patience.

532
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
And then what?

533
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,960
What are you going to do?

534
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,000
Like this, Wan.

535
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,480
I’m going to bed now.

536
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,160
Did they really treat their child like this?

537
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,200
-Mom thinks Ek shouldn’t endure this anymore.
-He has to endure it.

538
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,280
Otherwise, what can he do?

539
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,160
If you go further,

540
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,560
the company’s reputation will definitely be damaged.

541
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,920
How will it be damaged?

542
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,120
Who would want to invest in someone who’s a failure in their personal life?

543
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,200
They can’t even handle their own life.

544
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,160
How will they be able to run a business successfully?

545
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,680
You’re always criticizing our child.

546
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,640
Have you ever listened to their reasons?

547
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,120
What reason?

548
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,480
Look at what they’ve done!

549
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,040
And look at what they’ve been through!

550
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,760
You’ve never listened.

551
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,640
Are you leaving already?

552
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,280
My name is Earth.

553
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,880
My name is Pleng.

554
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,960
Do we really have to be so formal?

555
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,880
I think we’re probably around the same age.

556
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,280
But it’s okay, bowing is cool, it looks pretty stylish.

557
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,480
By the way, I’m sorry about earlier…

558
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,480
for jumping in and playing with you without asking first.

559
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,000
It’s alright.

560
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,280
If I had lost focus, I just wouldn’t have been able to continue playing,
and I’d have embarrassed of the audience, that’s all.

561
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,680
Don’t worry.

562
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,200
I’m confident

563
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,920
I could’ve taken you through the entire song.

564
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,480
Very confident indeed.

565
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,480
Pleng.

566
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,280
It’s Earth.

567
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,000
He’s my friend.

568
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,560
He’s a producer.

569
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,880
He’s made music for many artists.

570
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,200
So...

571
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,560
You purposely brought him to play with me today?

572
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,880
Yes.

573
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,600
I just wanted you two to get to know each other.

574
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,480
In case you might work together in the future.

575
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,600
Exchange contacts.

576
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,880
Hey man.

577
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,680
No need to rush.

578
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,600
I come here every day anyway.

579
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,480
We’ll definitely see each other again.

580
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,000
So, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be on my way.

581
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,280
I don’t think you just wanted me to get to know her, right?

582
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,000
You’re going all out with this.

583
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,800
You’re really pushing for it.

584
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,400
I want you to woo her.

585
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,680
Why?

586
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,880
Because she’s close to Wan.

587
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,480
But I think they’re too close.

588
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,680
I want them to distance themselves.

589
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,400
Otherwise, Wan won’t come back to me for sure.

590
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,080
So you want me to...

591
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,800
Be a tool to help you win your wife back?

592
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,880
Exactly.

593
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,280
You’re cunning.

594
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,200
But whatever.

595
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,080
I can’t say no.

596
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,200
She’s actually pretty interesting.

597
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,400
Clamp, please.

598
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,040
You can take the patient for an X-ray.

599
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,040
Have you been here long?

600
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,640
Not long at all.

601
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,120
Are you tired from work?

602
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,840
Seeing your face makes all the tiredness go away.

603
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
I don’t get to see you working much.

604
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,960
You look really cool doing it.

605
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,200
It’s just work.

606
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,440
The uniform looks good too.

607
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,840
This uniform?

608
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,320
How does it look good?

609
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,720
Well...

610
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,920
It looks professional.

611
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,240
And also...

612
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,240
It looks easy to take off.

613
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,520
Saying things like that...

614
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,640
Are you going to take it off for me?

615
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,320
Can I?

616
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,520
Come here.

617
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,920
Come here.

618
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,520
If you’re so confident, take it off then.

619
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,800
Pleng.

620
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,080
I’m not taking it off that easily.

621
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,000
Guy, what are you here for?

622
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,400
Oh, I was feeling sleepy, so I thought I’d come take a nap.

623
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,720
But you…

624
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,280
It’s a friend.

625
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,360
I couldn’t find something,

626
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,800
so I asked them to help me look for it.

627
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,720
I’ll be going now.

628
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,600
What’s wrong?

629
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,920
Why do you look like you’ve just seen a ghost?

630
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,720
Do you think that doctor from earlier

631
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,200
knows what we were doing?

632
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,080
No, they don’t.

633
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,920
What’s his name again?

634
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,080
Guy.

635
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,400
Are you two close?

636
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Why are you asking so many questions?

637
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,520
Are you interested in him?

638
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,120
Are you crazy?

639
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,080
I’m just worried that doctor

640
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,400
might tell someone else about this.

641
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,920
I don’t want you to get in trouble.

642
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,880
You don’t need to worry.

643
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,800
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?

644
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,200
I just don’t like it when you ask about other people.

645
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,000
Aren’t you overreacting?

646
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,280
Are you saying you don’t want me to have friends or a social life?

647
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,800
You don’t need any.

648
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,720
Just having me is enough.

649
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,080
Because I’ll only have you, too.

650
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,440
That’s easy for you to say.

651
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,600
You still have Ek, don’t you?

652
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,200
Even though you two have broken up,

653
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,080
I still feel like

654
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,600
there’s something unresolved between you and Ek.

655
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,400
Like there’s something left hanging.

656
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,720
I don’t even know what it is.

657
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,440
Is something wrong?

658
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,240
Why did you ask me to come earlier than scheduled?

659
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,400
Wan called me this morning.

660
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,240
Said if I don’t hurry up and file for divorce,

661
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,840
Wan will file for divorce against me.

662
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,440
Divorce?

663
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,240
So that means…

664
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,360
You and Wan...

665
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,160
You two are married?

666
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,920
And you’ve registered your marriage too?

667
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,360
So if Wan wants to divorce you,

668
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,840
it’s not surprising, right?

669
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,560
Didn’t you cheat on Wan?

670
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,440
That’s not the reason.

671
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,320
If that were really the reason,

672
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,960
I wouldn’t have been able to keep Wan with me until now.

673
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,040
Wan must have someone new.

674
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,640
And how do you know that?

675
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,640
Wan told me herself.

676
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,360
She said she loves that person very much.

677
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,600
She loved them

678
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,840
even before she met me.

679
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,640
Pleng, could you possibly help…

680
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,440
Can you please tell me who it is?

681
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,840
I don’t know.

682
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,840
And even if I did, I couldn’t tell you, Ek.

683
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,640
It’s Wan’s personal matter.

684
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,960
Besides,

685
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,120
you and Wan have already broken up.

686
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,360
You have no right to interfere in her life anymore.

687
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,760
I broke up with Wan,

688
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,360
but we haven’t registered our divorce yet.

689
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,640
So doesn’t that make Wan’s new guy her lover?

690
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,560
Isn’t he just an affair?

691
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,560
I’m begging you, Pleng.

692
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,960
If you know who it is...

693
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,160
Can you please tell me?

694
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,640
I really don’t know.

695
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,440
And…

696
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,960
If you find out, what will you do?

697
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,280
I’ll kill him.

698
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,920
Did you wait long for me?

699
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,640
Marry me, Wan.

700
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,160
Wan.

701
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,640
Marry me.

702
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,600
Ever since I saw you again,

703
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,280
I’ve never thought about turning back.

704
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,600
You told me that if I graduated and became a doctor,

705
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,520
I could ask for anything from you and you’d give it to me.

706
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,400
If you want me,

707
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,000
I’ll give myself to you.

708
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,360
Over the past 10 years,

709
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,480
you’ve made Wan suffer enough because of you.

710
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,280
So if you leave her again this time,

711
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,520
she probably won’t be more hurt than she already is.

712
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,800
What happened to your finger?

713
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,800
I cut it with a knife.

714
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,200
That’s not good.

715
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,200
Because someone like you, Pleng,

716
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,120
must use your fingers often, right?

717
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,520
Here come the tears, right on cue.
(Flawless tear control)

718
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,280
Go ahead.

719
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,240
(Tear command clip)

720
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,800
Smells nice, doesn’t it?

721
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,440
It usually smells good in the evening.
(You’ve left your scent on me)

722
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,120
It’s been here since yesterday.

723
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,800
No, it stinks.

724
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,160
(The scent of love)

725
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,720
Just a little, though.

726
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,280
Isn’t it?

727
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,080
Come here.

728
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,040
(Got a sniff)

729
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,600
You’re talented, aren’t you?
(Go on, sniff again)
