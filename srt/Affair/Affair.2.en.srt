1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,160
I just want to be Miss Wanwiwa

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,160
who stays by Miss Sadabpin’s side forever.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,600
If I have you, I don’t need anything else.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,680
What if one day I get a boyfriend and I have to get married?

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,160
What will you do then?

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,120
To prevent that from happening,

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,680
I need to find a boyfriend before you do.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,920
You’re jealous of me.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,360
Are you crazy? Friends don’t get jealous.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
I’m going to become a doctor.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,120
Let’s hope that’s true.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,680
If I do it,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,920
what will you give me?

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,720
Do it first, then you can ask.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,080
Have you reached your friend's house yet?

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,280
I’m just stopping by to buy some supplies for the project.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,720
Where are you right now?

18
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,280
Wan!

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,600
This isn’t just a coincidence, is it?

20
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,280
So, how do I even explain this...

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
I was taking a break from my study group.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,440
And I decided to grab a bite here.

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Then I saw you and your crew, Wan.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,199
So, I kinda followed you.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,880
And why would you do that?

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,000
Because I wanted to chat with you.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Hey, Wan!

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,800
We’re heading to the store to stock up on some snacks.

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
Can you cover the bill for us?

30
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,480
Then catch up with us, yeah?

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,600
Hurry up!

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,520
Hold up!

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,280
Hand it over.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Let me help you carry that.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
It’s fine, I can manage on my own.

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, just let him help.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,880
He’s trying to be a gentleman.

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
Don’t hurt his feelings.

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,480
Pleng.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,640
How did you even find me here?

41
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,720
Wait, were you following me?

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,400
Is it you?

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
The one who keeps calling Wan?

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,200
Do you like Wan or something?

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Pleng...

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
Yeah, I think you do.

47
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,120
I mean, if you just wanted to be friends,

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,520
you wouldn’t act like this.

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,360
Theoretically speaking...

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,040
A guy and a girl.

51
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,120
They can’t just be friends.

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,200
What are you talking about?
That’s nonsense.

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,320
Are you so into guys now that you think I’m talking nonsense?

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello?

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Wan, I’m done. Are you finished yet?

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,920
Okay, I’m heading out then.

57
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,280
I’ve got to go now.

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
Make sure you get home safe.

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,240
I’m worried about you.

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
Yeah, I do like Wan.

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
So, you finally admitted it.

62
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,279
You’re not happy about it, are you?

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,480
And why would I be unhappy?

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,480
I don’t know.

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
The way you’re acting says it all.

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,159
If something’s bothering you, just tell me directly.

67
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
I’m ready to fix it.

68
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,600
Why do you even care about how I feel?

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,240
Because you’re Wan’s boss.

70
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,800
If you don’t like me, maybe Wan won’t either.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,240
Did Wan say I’m her boss?

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Did she also mention that I’m her best friend?

73
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,800
But doesn’t that make your opinion matter even more?

74
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,600
It doesn’t, though.

75
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,240
This is Wan’s decision alone.

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,000
Even if I don’t like you, if Wan does, I can’t stop her.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
So, you really don’t like me, do you?

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,520
No, it’s not.

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,600
But we don’t really know each other that well yet.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,400
So, I’ve got a bit of a wall up.

81
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,320
In that case...

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,920
Could you help me win Wan over?

83
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,200
That way, we can get to know each other better.

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
Could you help me win Wan over?

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,200
That way, we can get to know each other better.

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Sure.

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,280
I can help with that.

88
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,000
But...

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
You have to answer a question for me first.

90
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
Do you have a dream?

91
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,520
A dream?

92
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,200
Well...

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
Something about your future, maybe?

94
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,360
How do you see yourself?

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
That question...

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
You’d probably have to ask my parents.

97
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,080
I don’t really have much of a say in that.

98
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
Keep dreaming if you think Wan would like someone like you.

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,960
Who doesn’t even have a dream of their own?

100
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,480
Pleng?

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,080
What are you up to?

102
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,800
Can I come in?

103
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
Just a sec.

104
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,120
What’s up?

105
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,200
Are you still mad at me?

106
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,200
About what?

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,080
About me saying you were being ridiculous.

108
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,040
Are you feeling guilty now?

109
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,400
Yeah, I am. A lot, actually.

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,920
Well, if you’re feeling guilty,

111
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,920
then I’m not mad anymore.

112
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,400
Is that all you wanted to ask?
If so, I’m going to finish my shower.

113
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,200
Wait! Can I join you?

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,400
My back’s killing me from working on my report.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sure, come on in.

116
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,880
I’ll give you a massage.

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,600
Seriously?

118
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,400
What are you doing?

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,440
You’re taking forever!

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,440
Stop dragging your feet, it’s annoying.

121
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,640
Are you still wearing my old bra?

122
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
That thing’s ancient.

123
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,800
You’re so weird.

124
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,880
I offered to buy you a new one, but you refused.

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
Do you really like inheriting my hand-me-downs that much?

126
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,960
Yeah, I love it.

127
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
You’ve been pretty diligent lately.

128
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,720
Of course!

129
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,040
I need to be ready for med school exams.

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,640
You still haven’t given up on becoming a doctor?

131
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,200
Why would I give up? It’s my dream.

132
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,800
That’s ridiculous.

133
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,320
It’s something I love, and you’re just doing it to impress me.

134
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
You and Ek are so alike.

135
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,400
Always tying your dreams to someone else.

136
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,600
When did you even talk to Ek?

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Well...

138
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,920
When we were apart for a bit.

139
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,600
And what did you two talk about?

140
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
Nothing much.

141
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
Ek just...

142
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Tried to get me to like him.

143
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
He thinks I have influence over your decisions.

144
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
Well, you kinda do.

145
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,120
You’re the only person in the world

146
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,400
that I believe everything you say.

147
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,600
No matter what.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,800
So, how are you feeling?

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,240
Any better?

150
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
After a warm bath and a good massage?

151
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
Much better.

152
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,000
So, how should I repay my masseuse?

153
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
A smile will do.

154
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,720
Whenever you smile,

155
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,640
it puts me in a good mood.

156
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
There, I smiled.

157
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,520
Now keep up the good work with the massage.

158
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,920
That’s enough.

159
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,080
I’m getting cold.

160
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,200
But the water’s warm!

161
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,480
Wan—Oh, be careful!

162
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,280
That feeling when your heart races near a close friend.

163
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,440
‘I feel my heart race whenever I’m close to this friend.’

164
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,280
‘Me too, especially when we make eye contact.’

165
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,080
‘Am I secretly in love?’

166
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
‘It’s probably just a crush.’

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,320
‘If it were love, it’d be more intense.’

168
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,600
‘Like feeling jealous when you see them with someone else.’

169
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
‘That kind of jealousy.’

170
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,440
Do you realize how contradictory you are?

171
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,320
Back at the gallery,

172
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,480
you said that if I were to date someone,

173
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,480
Ek seemed like a good choice.

174
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,400
But now that Ek and I are actually getting to know each other,

175
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,280
you’re jealous.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
Wan—

177
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,680
What are you saying?

178
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,400
You’re jealous of me.

179
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,240
You’re jealous of me, Pleng.

180
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
Pleng?

181
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,000
Why are you in here?

182
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,720
I came to see if you were awake,
to see if you wanted to join me for breakfast.

183
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,200
Well, I’m awake.

184
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,080
What were you looking at?

185
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,040
Don’t pry.

186
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,400
Can you just not?

187
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,320
And from now on,

188
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,160
don’t come into my room unless I say you can.

189
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,760
Got it! Now go.

190
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
Why? Did I do something wrong?

191
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,480
Can you not ask?

192
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,240
I told you to leave, so just go.

193
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,920
Your eyes look swollen... didn’t you sleep?

194
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,720
Or are you not feeling well?

195
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,200
You don’t have a fever.

196
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
You’re actually really cold.

197
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,480
I told you to leave, Wan.

198
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,840
Don’t make me say it again.

199
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,520
Just go.

200
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,360
Fine, I’ll go. No need to be so harsh.

201
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,800
Finish up whatever you’re doing and come down. I’m waiting for breakfast.

202
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,200
Don’t wait.

203
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,240
If you’re hungry, just eat.

204
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
And for the rest of the day,

205
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,640
don’t bother me.

206
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,880
I need to focus.

207
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,120
I’m working on a new song.

208
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,800
Now go.

209
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,280
Hurry up.

210
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,040
If this keeps up,

211
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,280
one day you’re going to find out.

212
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,480
Oh, what should I do?

213
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,160
What should I do?

214
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,720
No, no, no, no, no...

215
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,000
Should I call?

216
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,880
What’s the number again?

217
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,800
Zero...

218
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,359
Zero-six...

219
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,000
Zero-six-three...

220
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,119
Zero...

221
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,960
Zero-six-three...

222
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,400
Hello?

223
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,200
Hi, Ek. It’s Pleng.

224
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,520
Are you free tomorrow?

225
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,720
Can we meet up?

226
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,120
Sure, where?

227
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,360
Anywhere, you pick.

228
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,640
In that case...

229
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,240
How about my usual spot?

230
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay.

231
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,880
Where are you?

232
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
You should come home now.

233
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,680
It’s going to rain, and you might catch a cold.

234
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,640
Have you heard from Wan at all?

235
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
I bought this for you.

236
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,320
A girl with a great figure like Pleng wouldn’t eat anything too fattening.

237
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
You know me well, huh?

238
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,520
This place?

239
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,480
This is your usual spot?

240
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,840
It’s hot and lonely.

241
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,040
I don’t see what’s so great about it.

242
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Well...

243
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,960
It’s peaceful here.

244
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,520
If you want peace, why not stay at home?

245
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,360
If my home were peaceful, that’d be great.

246
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,000
That would be nice.

247
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,520
So, is there a reason you wanted to meet here, Pleng?

248
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,120
I just wanted to know...

249
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,080
Have you ever had a girlfriend before?

250
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,440
Why do you ask?

251
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,120
Do you like me or something?

252
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,960
Are you out of your mind?

253
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,600
Well...

254
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,400
I’ve dated around a bit.

255
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,640
But if it doesn’t feel right, we just part ways.

256
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
And what do you mean by "doesn’t feel right"?

257
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,440
Well...

258
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,840
I’m a very private person.

259
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,800
Sometimes I just want to be alone for no reason.

260
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,840
Most women who talk to me don’t really get that.

261
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,440
In that case, you probably can’t date Wan.

262
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,640
Wan’s like most women.

263
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,600
She’d be really attached to her partner.

264
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,400
It’s not the kind of relationship where you can just do your own thing.

265
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,160
But if it’s with Wan,

266
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
I’d be willing.

267
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
I’ve found my answer.

268
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,160
When you asked me what my dream was...

269
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
I want to be with Wan.

270
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,920
If possible...

271
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,160
I’d like to build a family with her.

272
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,600
It might sound silly...

273
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,680
For someone my age to say that.

274
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,320
But that’s really how I feel.

275
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,440
But why does it have to be Wan?

276
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,240
I don’t know.

277
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,520
Wan has something...

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,160
That I’ve been looking for.

279
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,920
Something?

280
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,120
What is it?

281
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,800
Warmth, I guess.

282
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,520
Warmth?

283
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
Are you lacking warmth?

284
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,440
Do your parents not love you?

285
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,800
Well, um...

286
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,600
You said your future depends on your parents, right?

287
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,920
What if your parents don’t like Wan?
What would you do then?

288
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,720
Wan would be the one thing...

289
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,440
That I wouldn’t let them interfere with.

290
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
Are you sure you can do that?

291
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,320
I’m sure.

292
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,160
I promise.

293
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,800
If I get to be with Wan,

294
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,960
I won’t let anyone hurt her.

295
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,120
Not even myself.

296
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,920
I won’t make her sad.

297
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,320
Fine.

298
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,640
I’ll help you get together with Wan.

299
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,800
You said it.

300
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
Don’t take it back.

301
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,520
Are you lacking warmth?

302
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,400
Do your parents not love you?

303
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,960
Ek...

304
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,600
Didn’t your dad tell you he’d only buy it if you came first in your exams?

305
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,240
Stop crying, Ek.

306
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,680
You’re a boy; don’t be so weak, okay?

307
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,920
Can I have a guitar, Mom?

308
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,360
Can you buy me one, please?

309
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,720
Didn’t you see the message I sent you?

310
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,920
I saw it.

311
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,760
Then why didn’t you reply?

312
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,400
I was just too lazy.

313
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,160
Where did you go?

314
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
To the mall.

315
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,720
With whom?

316
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,040
With the guy who’s trying to win you over.

317
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Ek?

318
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,960
Why did you meet Ek again?

319
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,760
So we could get to know each other better.

320
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,720
To see if he’s right for you.

321
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
I think Ek’s pretty great.

322
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
If you like him,

323
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,400
I’m rooting for you two.

324
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,960
I think it’s about time.

325
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,840
It’s about time you had a boyfriend.

326
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
What did you say?

327
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,640
Oh, nothing.

328
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,040
Just that.

329
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Now go.

330
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,200
I need to do my homework.

331
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,920
Wait a second.

332
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Let’s talk first.

333
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,720
You were just jealous when you found out Ek was into me.

334
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,680
But now you’re playing matchmaker.

335
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
What’s going on in your head?

336
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,560
I’m just thinking it’s time we grew up.

337
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,400
We need to stop being so attached.

338
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,720
And start living our own lives.

339
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,920
Don’t you remember what my mom said?
If I keep clinging to you like this,

340
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,040
We’ll never be able to move on.

341
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,920
I don’t want to go anywhere.

342
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,760
But one day, we’ll have to.

343
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,440
One day, we’ll have to go our separate ways.

344
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,040
So, we might as well get used to it now.

345
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,680
Hurry up and get a boyfriend.

346
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,360
Then I can get one too.

347
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,720
Is this really what you want?

348
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,720
Are you sure?

349
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,960
Can you stop asking? It’s annoying.

350
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,720
You’re being annoying.

351
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,680
You’re walking so slow; we’re going to be late.

352
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,440
I’m starving. Are you guys hungry?

353
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,280
Hungry? Yeah, I’m really hungry.

354
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,360
What should we eat?

355
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,000
Noodles?

356
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,240
Sure, let’s go.

357
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,200
Same as usual?

358
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,480
Fried rice?

359
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,520
Fried rice, yeah?

360
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,800
Hey.

361
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,200
We don’t know the exact details, okay?

362
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,600
I just happened to overhear my dad talking to my uncle.

363
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,200
Apparently, her dad...

364
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,360
Got involved in some kind of corruption.

365
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,440
And now...

366
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,400
What’s Pleng going to do if that’s the case?

367
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,800
I feel sorry for her, honestly.

368
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,680
Why would you feel sorry for her?
Everyone in our class hates her.

369
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,520
(Wan)

370
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,960
Can I come in?

371
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,600
Come in, dear.

372
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,120
How are you?

373
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,720
It’s late, why aren’t you in bed?

374
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,320
I was waiting for you to come home, Dad.

375
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Is something wrong?

376
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,800
Dad...

377
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,960
There’s a problem at your company, isn’t there?

378
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,680
Who told you that?

379
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,520
I heard some friends at school talking about it.

380
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,040
And where did your friends hear that from?

381
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,160
Answer me first, Dad.

382
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,200
Is it true or not?

383
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,720
Yes,

384
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,680
there is a problem.

385
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,520
But it’s not that big of a deal.

386
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,800
And I’ve already found a way to handle it.

387
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
Really?

388
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,320
But what my friends were saying...

389
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,000
Whatever they said doesn’t matter.

390
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,800
It’s nothing beyond what your dad can handle.

391
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,080
Didn’t you tell me yourself?

392
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,320
That your dad is amazing?

393
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Yes.

394
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,400
My dad is the most amazing person in the world.

395
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,400
In that case,

396
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,560
You have to trust your dad, okay?

397
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,920
And don’t worry about me.

398
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,320
Everything will be fine soon.

399
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,640
Now go to bed.

400
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,040
I love you, Dad.

401
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,960
I love you too, Pleng.

402
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,920
I warned you,

403
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,920
not to invest in this company.

404
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,960
But you were stubborn.

405
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,240
But I thought...

406
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,480
That’s enough, Wut.

407
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,040
What I need from you

408
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,520
is to clear everything with the auditors.

409
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,320
Including your personal accounts.

410
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,480
What does this have to do with my personal accounts?

411
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,200
Because I suspect

412
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,560
that you might be involved in this corruption.

413
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Because you were

414
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,040
the one who initiated this whole thing from the start.

415
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,000
How could you think that about me?

416
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,680
We’ve been working together for so many years.

417
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,000
You know the kind of person I am.

418
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,120
I would never do something so immoral.

419
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,440
But when it comes to personal gain,

420
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,360
it can affect anyone.

421
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,840
But if you’re truly innocent,

422
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,440
you have nothing to fear.

423
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
I’m going to bed now, Dad.

424
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,640
You should get some sleep too.

425
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,520
Okay.

426
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,160
Good night.

427
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,520
Good night.

428
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,400
(Examination ID Card: Ekkarin Pipattanakul)

429
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,400
(Congratulations! You have been accepted
into the Business Administration Faculty.)

430
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,120
How did your exam results turn out, son?

431
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,440
Just as you expected, Mom.

432
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,240
Really?

433
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,520
Are you serious, Ek?

434
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,200
Yes.

435
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,240
I’m so relieved.

436
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,800
Do you know, Ek?

437
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,680
The other day, your father told me that if you didn’t pass the exam,

438
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,040
he wouldn’t let you take over the company.

439
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,600
Just because I didn’t pass the exam?

440
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,440
It’s not just that.

441
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,520
Your father said he’s been thinking for a long time

442
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,720
that you’re not qualified.

443
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,920
Because since you were a child,

444
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,800
you’ve never shown any signs of
being a leader or achieving anything significant.

445
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,320
Do you remember, Ek?

446
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,120
That in your entire life, you only came first once in exams?

447
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
That’s why your father believes

448
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,720
that if you failed this time,

449
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,440
it would be proof that you really can’t do it.

450
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,600
That’s why I kept reminding you

451
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,320
to focus.

452
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,240
Yes, Mom.

453
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,440
Is there anything else, Mom?

454
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,920
If not, I’d like to excuse myself.

455
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,640
Wait, wait, just a second.

456
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,320
Ek, are you going out with your friends?

457
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,680
I transferred some money to you.

458
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,760
I’ll call your dad and let him know; it’ll make him feel better.

459
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,840
(40,000 Baht)

460
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,960
If you have something to say, just say it now.

461
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,520
I want to go back to sleep.

462
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,320
I want to see Wan.

463
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,600
Can you help me find a way to meet her?

464
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,520
What’s the matter?

465
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,520
Why do you want to see Wan so badly?

466
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,040
It’s something important, I’ll tell you later.

467
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
What is it?

468
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I can’t tell you.

469
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,560
I want to tell Wan first.

470
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,720
Fine.

471
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,040
I’ll try to help you find a way.

472
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,720
But I can’t promise I’ll succeed.

473
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,480
You’re all dressed up.

474
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,760
Where are you going, Mom?

475
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,880
I’m going to the supermarket with Aunt Wi.

476
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Going to buy some things to make
canned fish fried rice for your dad for dinner.

477
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,720
You’re going to cook?

478
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,360
Why?

479
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,120
No need to make that face.

480
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,680
I can cook, at least this one dish.

481
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,880
I’ve been practicing it since I first started dating your dad.

482
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,360
Really?

483
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,640
Of course!

484
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
That’s why your dad always begs me to make this dish.

485
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,000
But I haven’t made it in a long time.

486
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,280
I’m not sure if it’ll taste the same as before.

487
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,000
Oh, so why all of a sudden

488
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,720
do you want to make it for Dad?

489
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,080
Well, lately,

490
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,400
I’ve noticed that your dad seems stressed.

491
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,360
It’s probably something to do with work.

492
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,600
So I thought I’d surprise him

493
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
to cheer him up a bit.

494
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,880
That’s a great idea!

495
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,440
While Dad is enjoying the canned fish fried rice you made,

496
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,280
I’ll play the piano for him.

497
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
That way, he’ll get double the encouragement!

498
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,320
That’s a great plan.

499
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
Alright, I’ll head out now.

500
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,760
Can I come with you, Mom?

501
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,040
Of course!

502
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,760
What about you Wan, wanna join us?

503
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,520
Wan probably can’t come, Mom.

504
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,840
Because...

505
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,320
I was going to ask Wan to buy me some guitar strings.

506
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,080
The old ones broke.

507
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,640
Could you go buy them for me?

508
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,040
The same store.

509
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,000
The same type.

510
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,280
You remember, right?

511
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,960
Let’s go then.

512
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,960
I’ll just grab my bag real quick, okay?

513
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,920
Alright.

514
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,120
You’ll meet up Wan at the guitar store
on the second floor of the same mall.

515
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,480
Are you fighting with Wan, dear?

516
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,920
No, we’re not.

517
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,520
Why do you ask that, Mom?

518
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,040
It’s just that I haven’t seen you two talk in days.

519
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,520
And just now, both of you looked tense.

520
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,120
Anyone could see it.

521
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,240
It’s not like that at all.

522
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,840
Wan and I are just...

523
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,000
Taking some space.

524
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,920
Oh?

525
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,080
And why do you need space?

526
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,000
We’re just preparing.

527
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,800
Just in case one day,

528
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,840
when Wan goes to university, we’ll have to go our separate ways anyway.

529
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,320
To get used to it.

530
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,040
You two...

531
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,320
Three days you’re fine, four days you’re fighting,
and two days later you’re fine again.

532
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,680
You’re giving me a headache.

533
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,600
Speaking of the future,

534
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,640
Did Wan ever tell Wi what she wants to study?

535
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,520
No, I don’t know at all.

536
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,480
We’ve never talked about it.

537
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,600
And what would you like Wan to study?

538
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,080
Honestly, I’d like her to study business.

539
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,400
I think it’s broad, and it opens up many opportunities.

540
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,640
But I know someone like Wan probably can’t handle it.

541
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
So I don’t have high expectations.

542
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,360
I just think...

543
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Let her study whatever she can manage.

544
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
Because no matter what, after graduating,
she’ll probably just be an ordinary office worker.

545
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,000
She won’t be anyone important or in a big position.

546
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,480
Do you really think I’d let Wan have a future like that?

547
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,080
Even though Wan isn’t my own child,

548
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,840
I’ve raised her like my own.

549
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
I’ve already thought about it.

550
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,760
After she graduates,

551
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,480
I’ll recommend her for a job at Khun Wut’s company.

552
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,040
I believe...

553
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,640
that Wan

554
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,200
will succeed in her own way.

555
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,440
Right, Pleng?

556
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,200
Don’t make that face.

557
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
And you, too.

558
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,280
No matter how much you love music,

559
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,240
you can’t abandon your dad’s company.

560
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,160
You need to help him out sometimes.

561
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,000
No way, Mom.

562
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,000
I’m scared of facing problems.

563
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,920
I don’t want to end up stressed like that.

564
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,160
I don’t like it.

565
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,840
Is there anyone in this world who doesn’t face problems?

566
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,880
If your dad is going through something right now,

567
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,720
it’s not the first time.

568
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,440
You know, before you were born,

569
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,640
he went through major crises before.

570
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,480
But he got through them.

571
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,120
Back then...

572
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,840
I wasn’t even by his side.

573
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,720
And...

574
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,840
Where were you, Mom?

575
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,040
I was...

576
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,080
Admitted to the hospital for almost a week.

577
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,120
Aunt Wi was the one

578
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,160
who took care of your dad instead of me.

579
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,720
Okay.

580
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,000
Thank you so much.

581
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,080
Mom...

582
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,120
When we get to the supermarket,

583
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,320
I’ll go take care of some of my own errands.

584
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,640
If you and Aunt Wi finish shopping, you can go home first.

585
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,160
You don’t need to wait for me.

586
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,600
Okay.

587
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,600
Excuse me.

588
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,240
Yes?

589
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,800
I’d like a set of guitar strings, please.

590
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,720
Oh, sure.

591
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
Guitar strings, right?

592
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,680
Are you the one who came with Khun Pleng before?

593
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,160
Yes, that’s me.

594
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,040
Oh, do you play the guitar too?

595
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,560
No, I don’t. I’m just buying them for Khun Pleng.

596
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,920
The strings broke again?

597
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,400
I just replaced them recently.

598
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,440
Let me grab another set for you.

599
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,840
Wan.

600
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,960
Don’t tell me this is just another coincidence.

601
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,680
Pleng told you, didn’t she?

602
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,320
I’m the one who asked her. Don’t be mad at Pleng.

603
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,640
Why did you do this?

604
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,240
Because I have something to tell you.

605
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,160
Then why didn’t you just call?

606
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,200
Then why didn’t you just call?

607
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,360
I did call.

608
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,040
I’ve been calling every day.

609
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,880
But it’s you, Wan, who never picks up.

610
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,600
Pleng, come here right now!

611
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,480
Wan...

612
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,720
Let go, Wan! You’re hurting me!

613
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,840
Are you using force on me now?

614
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,280
You’re so controlling!

615
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,400
Everything I do is for you!

616
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,960
You’re not doing it for me.

617
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,240
You’re doing it for yourself.

618
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,320
What do you mean by that?

619
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,920
You just want to distance yourself from me.

620
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,840
That’s why you’re pushing me towards Ek.

621
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,240
Without even asking me.

622
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,240
Whether I want that or not.

623
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,200
If I had asked you,

624
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,440
you would’ve said no.

625
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,760
Exactly.

626
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
You knew it all along, but you still did it.

627
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,640
Honestly,

628
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,800
if you just want to distance yourself from me,

629
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,000
then step back.

630
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,160
Don’t make things more complicated.

631
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,320
And it’s none of your business.

632
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,480
Wan...

633
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,280
Are you saying I’m meddling?

634
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,240
Wan...

635
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
Don’t look at me like that.

636
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
Whatever I do is my business.

637
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,040
Can you just stop bothering me already?

638
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,360
Or else, I’ll use the same word you once did.

639
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,120
What word?

640
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,480
The word “annoyed.”

641
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,000
Wan...

642
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,520
Someone like you...

643
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,160
You won’t stay annoyed with me for long.

644
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Soon enough, you’ll come running back to me.

645
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,880
Pleng...

646
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:32,960
Hmm?

647
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,600
I hate you.

648
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Pleng...

649
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,080
I hate you.

650
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,720
Wan...

651
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,400
Can you go get Pleng for me?

652
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,640
She said she’d come down to help after her shower.

653
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,360
It’s been over an hour now.

654
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,480
Okay.

655
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,360
Pleng...

656
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,680
Pleng...

657
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,680
Pleng, open the door for me, please.

658
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,000
Pleng...

659
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,280
Pleng...

660
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,360
Pleng...

661
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,600
What’s going on, Wan?

662
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,960
I don’t know, Pleng’s not responding.

663
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,680
No matter how much I call, she won’t open the door.

664
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,800
Pleng...

665
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,840
Pleng...

666
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,080
Pleng...

667
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,480
Pleng, open the door!

668
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,440
Ma’am! Ma’am!

669
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,040
Ma’am! Ma’am!

670
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,320
The key!

671
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,800
Ma’am!

672
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,880
Ma’am!

673
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,960
Pleng...

674
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,040
Pleng...

675
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,080
Pleng...

676
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,160
Pleng!

677
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,240
Pleng...

678
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,520
Pleng...

679
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,800
Pleng...

680
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,000
Pleng...

681
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,280
Pleng...

682
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,920
Pleng...

683
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,600
Pleng...

684
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,920
Pleng...

685
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,200
Pleng...

686
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,920
If you keep being this stubborn,

687
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,400
I’m going to shout for everyone to know that I love you!

688
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,920
Are you daring me?

689
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,720
I love you, Pleng!

690
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,840
You bought this for me?

691
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,240
So you can keep sitting in my old bra.

692
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,640
You bought it for me already.

693
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,320
Now try it on for me too.

694
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,880
I can’t sleep.

695
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,480
Want to fall asleep?

696
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,960
I’ll help you with that.

697
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,600
Ugh, life is so depressing.

698
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,480
Is this what they call a fallen princess?

699
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,320
It’s so cramped in here.

700
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,000
It tickles, you’re rubbing my leg.

701
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,640
(What are you two doing?)

702
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,000
Not cold anymore in this scene.

703
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:16,640
Water...

704
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,280
Fountain...

705
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,480
Hot... (exhausted)

706
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,360
Onsen...

707
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,480
Time for a second bath.

708
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,120
Want to take a bath? Let’s go take a bath.

709
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,920
Let’s bathe together.

710
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,960
It’s cold.

711
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,080
(Such a skinship moment)

712
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,720
You’ve been looking tired lately.

713
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,480
Not planning to sleep, just working out.

714
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,440
Abs line 11.

715
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,280
CPR.

716
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,080
Nubpo is munching! (Come on, wake up and play with me.)

717
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,360
Nubpo is munching, munching! Good boy.

718
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,880
Nubpo is munching, munching! Good boy.

719
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,560
Hey, you guys.

720
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,880
Let’s go eat!

721
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,040
I’m not really that hungry yet.

722
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,920
Okay.

723
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,720
Come on, let’s go.

724
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,240
Her dad got involved in some corruption or something.

725
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,320
And now he’s about to get in trouble.

726
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,280
If that happens, what’s Pleng gonna do?

727
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,680
When I think about it, I actually feel kinda bad for her.

728
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,080
Why are you feeling sorry for her?

729
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,560
Everyone in our year hates her.

730
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,680
Maybe if she gets knocked down a peg, she’ll stop being so smug.

731
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,200
Sin!
