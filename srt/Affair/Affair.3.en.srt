1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,520
When you smile

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,000
It makes me feel good.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,520
I smiled for you.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,720
Now give me a proper massage.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,720
My heart races when I'm near my best friend.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,200
Am I secretly in love with them?

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,320
If you leave it like this,

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,880
One day, you'll definitely find out.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,160
I want to see Wan.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,680
Can you help me figure this out, Pleng?

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,640
I’m afraid I’ll have to ask Wan to buy me some guitar strings.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,000
Go buy them for me, will you?

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,200
Wan.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,520
Don’t tell me it’s just a coincidence.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,800
You’re so...

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,520
Such a control freak.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,400
Everything I do is for you.

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
You just want to get away from me.

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,400
That’s why you pushed me towards Ek.

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,600
I hate you.

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
Pleng!

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,400
You!

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,960
You’re awake?

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,280
How did I end up here?

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Madam and I brought you here.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
You...

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,720
You always make me worry.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,920
And...

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,200
Where’s my mom?

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
She’s talking to the doctor.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,800
She’ll be here soon.

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,400
Do you want me to go get her for you?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
No, it’s fine.

34
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,920
You stay right here.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,200
I just want to be alone with you.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
What’s wrong?

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,200
Are you worried about me?

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,240
Didn’t you say you hated me?

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,320
You have no idea

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,320
How I felt

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,320
When I saw you passed out in the bathtub.

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,400
And how did you feel?

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
I was scared.

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,320
I was scared you wouldn’t wake up again.

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
Scared that

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,800
Your last memory

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,560
Would be me saying I hated you.

48
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
So, do you hate me?

49
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,600
I don’t hate you.

50
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
When people hate each other,

51
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,839
They don’t cry for one another.

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,200
You’re not answering my question.

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,720
I asked if you hated me.

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,800
I love you.

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
You’re awake, dear?

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
How are you feeling?

57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,200
I’m feeling better, Mom.

58
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
I’m sorry, Pleng,

59
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,480
For ruining Dad’s surprise plan.

60
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Not at all, dear.

61
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,200
Even if you weren’t lying here,

62
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,280
The plan would’ve fallen through anyway.

63
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,040
Your dad messaged me saying,

64
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,920
He was coming home late no matter what.

65
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,520
And did you know?

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You almost gave me a heart attack.

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
Who does that?

68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,280
Lying in hot water until your body overheats.

69
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,240
Don’t do that again, okay?

70
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,600
Okay.

71
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,120
Madam,

72
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,320
Does Pleng need to be admitted?

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,840
No, dear.

74
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,960
The doctor said once this IV finishes, she can go home.

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
But tonight,

76
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,240
Can Wan stay with Pleng?

77
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,200
I’m still worried.

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Of course, Madam.

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,920
Pleng,

80
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,720
Don’t stress about the master.

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
He’s really strong, you know.

82
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,200
He’ll get through this problem.

83
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
You talk like you know everything.

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
I thought you were asleep.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
If you thought I was asleep,

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
Why did you even say that?

87
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,360
Well, if you’re not asleep,

88
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
Then talk with me for a while.

89
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
I can’t sleep.

90
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,640
What should we talk about?

91
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,560
I don’t know.

92
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,120
I just want to talk, that’s all.

93
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,600
We’ve spent the past week just being mad at each other.

94
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,680
Ever since Ek came into the picture.

95
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
Can I ask you something?

96
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
Do you not like Ek at all?

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
It’s not that I don’t like him.

98
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,400
But I’m just not ready to open up.

99
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,320
And you?

100
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,720
Didn’t you say you were looking for a partner?

101
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,400
Have you found one yet?

102
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,320
No, I haven’t.

103
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,000
Because I’m not really looking.

104
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,120
What I said was just to tease you.

105
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,120
I think...

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,040
I’m fine living like this.

107
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,320
Living alone, I mean.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,520
I thought you’d say living with me.

109
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
(Ek)

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
Are you really asleep?

111
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,600
If you don’t wake up…

112
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,520
I’ll...

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,919
What are you going to do?

114
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,720
I thought you were tough.

115
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,520
Serves you right.

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,920
Pleng, that hurt!

117
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,080
You’re the one who likes to show off.

118
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,720
Serves you right.

119
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,000
I’m feeling sleepy.

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,720
I’m going to sleep now.

121
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,600
You should sleep soon too.

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,400
You have class early tomorrow.

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Hey, I’m not joking, I’m going to sleep now.

124
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
I’m not joking.

125
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,120
If you want to sleep, then sleep.

126
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
I’ll just keep holding you like this.

127
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,520
So you’ll stay warm.

128
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,120
And won’t pass out in the bath again.

129
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
You didn’t answer my question.

130
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,800
I asked if you hated me.

131
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,200
I love you.

132
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
When you wake up, text me and let me know how you’re doing.

133
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,240
I’ll come back as soon as class is over.

134
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,880
What is it now?

135
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,040
Is Pleng having problems with Wan because of me?

136
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,320
No, not at all.

137
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,200
Are you sure?

138
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,720
It feels like Wan isn’t too happy

139
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,000
That Pleng set up the meeting for me and Wan.

140
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Maybe just a little.

141
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,800
Doing something without telling her...

142
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,240
Anyone would feel upset about that.

143
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,520
So, would it be okay

144
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,800
If I asked Pleng to set up another meeting with Wan?

145
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,840
But this time, be upfront about it,

146
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,040
And say I want to meet Wan.

147
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,400
I have something important I want to tell her.

148
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
Honestly,

149
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
What’s this important thing?

150
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,920
What are you going to tell her?

151
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,000
If you want my help but won’t tell me,

152
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,880
I think I should know.

153
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,920
Otherwise, the outcome might be the same as before.

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
I got accepted directly into the Business program.

155
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,000
I want to tell Wan.

156
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,000
I want Wan to be happy for me.

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
If Pleng had someone she liked,

158
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
When Pleng accomplished something,

159
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,120
She would probably want to do the same as me, right?

160
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,320
Right?

161
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
Help me one more time, please.

162
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,520
I’m begging you.

163
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
Aunt Wi.

164
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,520
Madam has been out on business since morning,

165
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,680
So she asked me to look after you, Pleng.

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,400
And how are you feeling, Pleng? Are you better?

167
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,520
I’m feeling better, thank you.

168
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,200
Pleng.

169
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,600
If it’s okay, I’d like to ask you something.

170
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,800
Sure.

171
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,400
Please have a seat, Aunt Wi.

172
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,600
It’s about the boy,

173
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,920
The one you and Wan used to talk about.

174
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,000
The one who liked Wan.

175
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,800
His name is Ek, right?

176
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,680
Yes, that’s right.

177
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,040
Why are you asking about Ek, Aunt Wi?

178
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,600
Well, lately, I’ve noticed he’s been calling Wan a lot,

179
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,120
But Wan doesn’t really talk to him.

180
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,680
So I was wondering if there’s some problem between them,

181
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,400
Or if he’s done something wrong to her.

182
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,640
No, there’s nothing.

183
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,000
Ek is a good person.

184
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,200
How is he good?

185
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,800
He’s good in every way, Aunt Wi.

186
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,720
His looks,

187
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,520
His status, and even his future.

188
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,520
Is he really that perfect?

189
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
If that’s the case,

190
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,720
Could I ask you, Pleng,

191
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,240
To help them become a couple?

192
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Since they’ll be going to university soon anyway.

193
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,320
Once they graduate,

194
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,600
They’ll have to get married and start a family.

195
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,400
If we meet someone good,

196
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
From now on,

197
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,880
We should quickly seize the opportunity.

198
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,000
We shouldn’t let it slip away.

199
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,880
Are you okay with that, Pleng?

200
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
If Wan ends up having a boyfriend before you?

201
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Well,

202
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
I’m okay with it.

203
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,600
But,

204
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,800
I think in matters like this,

205
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,720
It’s better to let Wan decide for herself, Aunt Wi.

206
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,200
No, Pleng.

207
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,600
My daughter is clueless.

208
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,080
She can't make decisions on her own.

209
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,320
She doesn't even know how to choose anything.

210
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,600
And besides, if you make the decision for her,

211
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,920
She wouldn’t dare to refuse.

212
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,120
Please.

213
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,520
If you're feeling better, then...

214
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,720
I'll go prepare some breakfast for you.

215
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Okay.

216
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
Thank you, Aunt Wi.

217
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
I’m feeling better now.

218
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,800
After school today, don’t come straight home.

219
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,000
I’ll come pick you up.

220
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,200
I want to grab some dessert, come with me?

221
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,200
What made you suddenly invite me for dessert?

222
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
You usually don’t even touch sweets.

223
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Aren’t you afraid of gaining weight?

224
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah.

225
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
But you love sweets.

226
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
You’re trying to please me.

227
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,800
Do you have something on your mind?

228
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,920
I want you to give Ek another chance.

229
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,599
Wan.

230
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,720
Just try. Give it a shot, okay?

231
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Give Ek another chance.

232
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,920
This is really important.

233
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,520
Please, Wan, I’m asking you.

234
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,680
Congratulations, Ek.

235
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
Your parents must be so proud of you.

236
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
My parents are probably just satisfied

237
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,480
That I didn’t embarrass them.

238
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,000
They’re not that proud, really.

239
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,320
But whatever,

240
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,320
I don’t really care about that anyway.

241
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,720
What anyone else thinks doesn’t matter to me.

242
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,800
As long as Wan praises me,

243
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,520
I’m happy.

244
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,320
Is that so?

245
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,520
Why are your expectations so low?

246
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,280
I thought you wanted to score more points with me.

247
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
What points?

248
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,880
Well, aren’t you trying to win me over?

249
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
This already counts as extra points.

250
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,000
I’m at a loss for words.

251
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,800
I’ll go order dessert now.

252
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
My treat.

253
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
Why is Wan’s name Wanwiwa ?

254
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,600
Because,

255
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,000
Wan’s mom went into labor with her

256
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,800
On the day her parents were registering their marriage.

257
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,320
So my mom named me Wanwiwa (Wedding Day).

258
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,000
Because my birthday

259
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,520
Fell on the same day my parents registered their marriage.

260
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,200
Pleng,

261
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,200
You really know Wan so well.

262
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
If you were a guy,

263
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,520
And I had to compete with you to win Wan’s heart,

264
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,520
I’d definitely lose.

265
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
Why do you think that?

266
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,000
I’m giving you the chance to get to know me better, aren’t I?

267
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,840
If you want to know something,

268
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
Just ask me.

269
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,520
I’ll answer myself.

270
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,080
No one else needs to.

271
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,320
I just remembered I need to go buy something.

272
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
You two get to know each other better while I’m gone.

273
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,200
I’ll be off then.

274
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,520
Wan,

275
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,320
Call me when you’re done.

276
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,800
We can leave together, so Aunt Wi won’t complain.

277
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
Pleng,

278
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,120
Finished talking with Ek?

279
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,400
I don’t know.

280
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,120
I just know that I’m full.

281
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,800
So we went our separate ways.

282
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,720
I didn’t want to sit for too long,

283
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,720
Didn’t want to trouble the shop.

284
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,400
And most importantly, I don’t like eating dessert with anyone else

285
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,720
Except you.

286
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Is this really the time to think about me?

287
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
You should be thinking about Ek instead.

288
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
I went out of my way to give you time with him.

289
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,960
You made an effort,

290
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
But you weren’t really willing.

291
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,280
Why are you doing this

292
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,600
When we both already understand each other?

293
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,800
Understand what?

294
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,600
That I love you,

295
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,200
And you love me.

296
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,720
Even if you don’t say it,

297
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,120
I can tell.

298
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,520
And since we love each other,

299
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,800
Why would you want me to love someone else?

300
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
It’s not the same, Wan.

301
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,400
Yes, we love each other,

302
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
But we love each other as friends.

303
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,800
Love is still love.

304
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,120
It doesn’t matter what kind of love it is.

305
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,920
Can you stop being so selfish for once?

306
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,000
Do you know that it’s not just me who wants you to be with Ek?

307
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,600
There are other people too.

308
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
Who else is there?

309
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,320
Wan, I’m begging you.

310
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Fine.

311
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,120
I’ll date Ek then.

312
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,120
But I’ll only date Ek if you’re no longer in my life.

313
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,360
But for now,

314
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,200
I’m going to stick with you like this.

315
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,080
No one will be able to pull me away from you, Pleng.

316
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,960
Wan, but...

317
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,240
But what?

318
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,200
We’re adults now.

319
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,640
I shouldn’t have to explain it any further.

320
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,920
Let’s go home.

321
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,920
Pleng,

322
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,640
If you keep being stubborn like this,

323
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,240
I’ll shout and let everyone know

324
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,040
That I love you.

325
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,800
You’re challenging me, huh?

326
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,840
-I love you, Pleng!
-Stop it, Wan!

327
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,640
Please, stop, Wan.

328
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,600
Okay, fine. I’ll go home. I give up.

329
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,320
-I love you!
-Wan!

330
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,120
Enough!

331
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,120
Let’s go home.

332
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,680
Pleng...

333
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,960
Can I sit with you?

334
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,160
Is that a new song?

335
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,280
I’ve never heard it before.

336
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,280
Is it the one you wrote the other day?

337
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,480
The day you were secretly looking at something on your computer?

338
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,160
I’m trying to concentrate.

339
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,880
Please don’t talk to me right now.

340
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,280
And there’s still no lyrics yet?

341
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,680
I haven’t thought of any yet.

342
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,360
So, can you write a song for me too, Pleng?

343
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,080
I’d love to have a song that you wrote for me.

344
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Sure.

345
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,880
But...

346
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,280
Let me think about it first.

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,360
I’ve never written a song about a friend before.

348
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,680
It’s not that hard.

349
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,280
Just write it based on how you feel.

350
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,240
If it’s love, then say it’s love.

351
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,280
Friends don’t usually write songs for each other.

352
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
Then,

353
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,880
Just say it straight out.

354
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,080
I’m waiting to hear.

355
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,080
You don’t have to say anything.

356
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
I won’t push you anymore.

357
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,880
But promise me,

358
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,680
That you’ll write this song for me.

359
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
I’ll write this song for you.

360
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,880
Thank you.

361
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,280
Why is Uncle here, Mom?

362
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,480
He’s probably here to talk about the issues at your dad’s company.

363
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,160
If they’re bringing in a lawyer,

364
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,560
It must be something serious.

365
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,360
So, when Dad told me

366
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,880
That it wasn’t a big deal, that wasn’t true, was it?

367
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
It’s nothing to worry about, dear.

368
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,360
Whether the problem at the company is big or small,

369
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,360
We always need a lawyer’s help.

370
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
Don’t worry about your dad, Pleng.

371
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,080
He’ll definitely handle everything.

372
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,880
Trust me.

373
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,480
Go talk to Frank, Pleng.

374
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,240
He’s waiting for your uncle in the living room.

375
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,160
He’s probably talking to Wan.

376
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,280
And how’s Wan doing with the bicycle?

377
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,040
She still can’t ride yet.

378
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,360
Look at her wound, it’s not healed yet.

379
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,040
Where have you been, Pleng?

380
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,080
Why did you leave Wan home alone?

381
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,680
Isn’t it a good thing?

382
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,480
Frank wanted to see Wan anyway.

383
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,560
Not at all.

384
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,840
My dad had business with your uncle,

385
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,080
So I just tagged along for fun.

386
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,480
You’re so close to Frank.

387
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,840
Aren’t you afraid Ek will get jealous?

388
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,960
Who’s Ek?

389
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,560
He’s Wan’s boyfriend, of course.

390
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,560
So, Wan really does have a boyfriend?

391
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Well, I told you before, but you didn’t believe me.

392
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,560
Yeah,

393
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,560
But...

394
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,160
I thought you were lying,

395
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,160
Just trying to block me from making a move on Wan.

396
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,160
And I know you’re really protective of Wan.

397
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,280
You’re right, Frank.

398
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
Pleng was lying.

399
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,880
But not completely.

400
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,840
Wan doesn’t have a boyfriend,

401
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,680
But I do have someone I love very much.

402
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Really?

403
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Yes.

404
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,480
I love them very much.

405
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,760
So, I guess I’ve lost my chance to date you.

406
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,960
Being siblings is much better.

407
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,280
If we were a couple, we’d eventually break up.

408
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,080
We’ve known each other since we were kids.

409
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,480
I don’t want to lose you, Frank.

410
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,360
Okay.

411
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,160
Sibling to sibling,

412
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,680
That’s nice too.

413
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,160
I get to have two lovely sisters.

414
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,640
But,

415
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,680
Nothing in this world is certain, right?

416
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,560
So, if one day

417
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,880
You change your mind, just let me know.

418
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,760
Frank!

419
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,360
Let’s go, it’s time to head home.

420
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,360
Yes, Dad.

421
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,560
Goodbye, Uncle.

422
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,680
Goodbye.

423
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,960
I’m off now.

424
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,880
Bye-bye, little sister.

425
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Goodbye.

426
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,880
Pleng...

427
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,480
Is something wrong?

428
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,760
I’m stressed about my dad.

429
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,360
I want to know what problems he’s really facing.

430
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
But Mom won’t let me talk to him.

431
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,480
Well, if your mom doesn’t want you to talk to him,

432
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,760
It means she’s already thought it through,

433
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,360
And it’s probably for your own good.

434
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,560
You should trust her.

435
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,160
Easy for you to say.

436
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,760
You’re not exactly perfect yourself.

437
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,080
Always being so obedient to your mom.

438
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,480
At least I’m not a liar like you.

439
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,960
How could you tell Frank something like that?

440
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,480
That I’m dating Ek?

441
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,480
I was just saying it as a possibility.

442
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,760
Because eventually,

443
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,760
You’re going to date Ek, right?

444
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,040
No, that’s not true.

445
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,080
I said I’d date Ek only if

446
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,360
You were no longer in my life.

447
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,160
But,

448
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,960
For me, that day will never come.

449
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,360
So, what did you buy?

450
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,880
A new bra?

451
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,480
It looks nice.

452
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,960
But it looks a bit mature.

453
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,280
Do you want it or not?

454
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
You bought it for me?

455
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,760
So you can stop wearing my old bras.

456
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,360
Try it on.

457
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,080
Not sure if it fits.

458
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,160
Since you bought it for me,

459
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,960
Why don’t you put it on for me?

460
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,080
Do I look good?

461
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Thank you.

462
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,760
Can I sleep with you again tonight?

463
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,080
I know you’re stressed about your dad.

464
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,960
I don’t want to leave you alone.

465
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,880
You’re trying to sneak a kiss again.

466
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,160
No, I’m not.

467
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,960
I just can’t sleep.

468
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,760
So I checked to see if you were asleep.

469
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,160
Can’t sleep?

470
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,080
Want to fall asleep?

471
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,360
I’ll help you.

472
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,360
Help with what?

473
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,080
Mom!

474
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,280
Mom!

475
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,000
What’s that sound, Mom?

476
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,760
Dad! Dad!

477
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,560
Dad! Dad!

478
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,880
Dad! Dad!

479
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,960
Wake up, Dad!

480
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,040
Please wake up, Dad!

481
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,360
Why did you do this, Dad?

482
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,280
Madam! Madam!

483
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,080
Madam!

484
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,960
Please calm down.

485
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,960
Pleng!

486
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,560
Madam! Madam!

487
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,880
Madam!

488
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,560
Did you really leave Pleng and Mom behind?

489
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,160
Wan! Wan, call an ambulance!

490
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Madam!

491
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,360
How could you leave Pleng and Mom like this?

492
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,680
Mom! Mom!

493
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,880
Mom!

494
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,080
Are you the patient’s family?

495
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,960
The patient has passed away from...

496
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,760
From sudden cardiac arrest.

497
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,960
I’m sorry for your loss.

498
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,280
Mom...

499
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,160
Why did you leave me, Mom?

500
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,840
What am I supposed to do now, Mom?

501
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,480
Pleng...

502
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,880
Hello.

503
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,360
Stay strong, Pleng.

504
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,680
Your parents are at peace now.

505
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,280
Thank you so much, Uncle.

506
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
It’s no problem.

507
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,240
I’m happy to help.

508
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,880
Let me do something for your parents.

509
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,640
I have something important to discuss with you, Pleng.

510
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,760
But,

511
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,960
We can talk after the funeral.

512
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,880
What is it about?

513
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,560
It’s about what

514
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,440
Your father entrusted to me.

515
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,360
We can talk about it now.

516
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,560
Not yet, Pleng.

517
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,160
Give yourself some time to grieve first.

518
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,480
Let’s talk about other things later.

519
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,680
I’m really worried about you.

520
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,560
Thank you, Frank.

521
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,280
I’m holding up.

522
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,560
This sum of money

523
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,560
Is what your father entrusted to me.

524
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,880
He wanted me to give it to you, Pleng.

525
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,360
Thank you so much, Uncle.

526
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
It’s no problem.

527
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Pleng,

528
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,880
Use this money wisely.

529
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,760
Because this is

530
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,880
The last thing he left behind for you.

531
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,560
What do you mean by that, Uncle?

532
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,680
All of your father’s assets right now,

533
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,200
Including the house you live in,

534
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,560
The house you’re living in now,

535
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,960
Is about to be seized.

536
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,280
And it will be sold to pay off his debts.

537
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,960
Pleng...

538
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,760
-Pleng!
-Let go of me! Let go!

539
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,960
Wan, let me go!

540
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,560
Let go of me, Wan! Let go!

541
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Wan, let me go!

542
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,760
Wan! Let go!

543
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,560
Wan...

544
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,240
Blaming yourself like this

545
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,760
Won’t bring Mr. and Mrs. back to life, you know.

546
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,080
Wan...

547
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,960
What’s happened has happened, and we have to accept it and be strong.

548
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,480
Crying and losing your mind like this won’t help.

549
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,080
From now on, you have to grow up and be an adult, Pleng.

550
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,960
There are many things you’ll need to handle on your own.

551
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,360
There’s no time for you to be drowning in sorrow like this, Pleng.

552
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,080
It’s probably not as comfortable here as it is at home, right, Pleng?

553
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,360
Whatever you can do by yourself,

554
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,960
You’ll have to do it on your own.

555
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,360
But if you don’t want to, that’s okay.

556
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
I’ll handle everything for you.

557
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,560
What do I need to do

558
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,360
To get through this?

559
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,760
You don’t have to do anything.

560
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,680
It’ll pass on its own.

561
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,160
I don’t want to be weak anymore.

562
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,160
I want to get through this as quickly as possible.

563
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,360
Like Aunt Wi said.

564
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,680
Don’t listen to my mom.

565
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,480
You’re human.

566
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,240
It’s okay to feel weak sometimes.

567
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
And what you’ve been through

568
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,960
Is really heavy.

569
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,960
No matter how hard you try to be strong,

570
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,960
It won’t change anything.

571
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,040
So,

572
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,760
If you’re feeling something right now,

573
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,080
Just let yourself feel it.

574
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,680
And,

575
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,480
In time, everything will get better.

576
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,480
It’s okay.

577
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,880
Let it all out.

578
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,560
I’ll be the one to wipe your tears.

579
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,360
Wan, you should go to school now.

580
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,760
Aren’t you going with her, Pleng?

581
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,680
Not yet.

582
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,440
Pleng needs to rest until she feels better.

583
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,160
If someone asks her something,

584
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,560
It might get tough for her.

585
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,560
It would just be a burden on me.

586
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,680
Why did you say that, Dad?

587
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,560
And why...

588
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,880
Just dealing with you and your mom

589
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,240
Is already hard enough for me.

590
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,160
And now I have to take care of her too?

591
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,560
Does that even make sense?

592
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,960
But Pleng’s parents were good to us.

593
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,080
They were good to you and your mom,

594
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,960
But not to me.

595
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,640
If you want to repay them,

596
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,360
Then go live with her somewhere else.

597
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,800
You don’t have to stay here.

598
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,880
-This is my house.
-Dad...

599
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,360
Go to school now.

600
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,160
You’ll be late.

601
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,760
Pleng, I brought you some food.

602
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,160
I’m not hungry, Aunt Wi.

603
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,240
I know you’re still upset, Pleng,

604
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,560
But I’ve already told you, haven’t I? You need to pull yourself together.

605
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,440
Otherwise, you’re going to make everyone

606
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,080
Worry about you even more.

607
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,680
I’m sorry, Aunt Wi.

608
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,680
It’s alright.

609
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,680
I just want you to get better quickly, Pleng.

610
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,080
So you can start doing what you need to do.

611
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,440
What do you mean by that, Aunt Wi?

612
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,280
You have the money that Mr. left for you, right?

613
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,960
Yes, I do.

614
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,760
So, what do you plan to do with that money, Pleng?

615
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,680
I don’t know.

616
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,080
I haven’t really thought about it yet.

617
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,160
But I guess...

618
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,880
I’ll use it to pay for tuition and

619
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,760
Personal expenses.

620
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,680
But have you thought about

621
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
What you’ll do when the money runs out?

622
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,680
What will you do, Pleng?

623
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,080
I think it would be good for you to think about it, Pleng.

624
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,280
Because I believe,

625
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,440
You know I can’t help you that much.

626
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,960
Other than letting you stay here

627
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,760
Until you can get back on your feet and move out.

628
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,680
I’m sorry for being so direct,

629
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,760
But this house isn’t mine.

630
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,280
I also have to be considerate of Wan’s father.

631
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,360
Yes, Aunt Wi.

632
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,160
I’ll try to get back on my feet as quickly as I can.

633
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,760
That’s good.

634
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,760
I believe you can do it, Pleng.

635
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,880
Now, eat your food.

636
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,080
Thank you.

637
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,360
Good job, you almost finished your meal.

638
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,880
But you still haven’t showered since this morning.

639
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,280
Should I help you with that?

640
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,280
What happened to your face?

641
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,360
Some kind of bug.

642
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,480
Probably a mosquito.

643
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,880
I ended up slapping it a little too hard.

644
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,960
Come on, let’s go shower.

645
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,800
My house doesn’t have a water heater.

646
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,280
It gets cold at night.

647
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,880
It’s okay.

648
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,560
I’ll shower by myself.

649
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,280
But I want to help you shower.

650
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,360
I said it’s okay.

651
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,640
You don’t need to trouble yourself.

652
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,160
Who said it’s a bother?

653
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,040
Taking care of you

654
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,080
Is my happiness.

655
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,040
But when you help me,

656
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,360
It brings me discomfort.

657
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,960
I’m going to school tomorrow.

658
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,160
Exams are coming up.

659
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,360
I don’t want to fall behind my friends.

660
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,240
How did you get here?

661
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,840
By bus?

662
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,080
Her house got seized.

663
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,280
Oh no, so she’s homeless now?

664
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,840
Where are you going to live now?

665
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,560
She probably has nowhere to stay.

666
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,560
That’s so unfortunate.

667
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,560
No house, no car either.

668
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,160
Who are you going to cry to?

669
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,360
Your dad’s gone, your mom’s gone too.

670
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,320
Such a sad life, huh! From a rich girl to nothing.

671
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,960
Yeah, you can’t act all confident anymore.

672
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,960
It’s really sad.

673
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,760
Sounds like a tragic story.

674
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Should we cry about it?

675
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,280
Why cry? Let her cry on her own.

676
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,040
Do you feel like crying along with her?

677
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,280
Pleng...

678
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,760
Is this what they call a fallen rich girl?

679
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,160
Don’t be too sad.

680
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,040
If you need any help,

681
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,160
Just let me know.

682
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,360
When are you guys going to stop being so fake?

683
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,280
Aren’t you tired of all this? Seriously.

684
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,080
What are you even talking about?

685
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,680
What am I talking about?

686
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,760
I heard everything in the music room that day.

687
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,160
You all hate me, don’t you?

688
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,960
And didn’t you say

689
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,880
That if I fall,

690
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,960
You’d kick me while I’m down?

691
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,760
So why haven’t you done it yet?

692
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,680
If you’re not going to,

693
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,960
Then get lost.

694
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,040
And don’t bother showing your face to me again.

695
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,560
I want to be alone.

696
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,040
Fine.

697
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,480
We’ll leave.

698
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,840
But don’t forget,

699
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,680
You don’t have your parents to protect you anymore.

700
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,280
I think you should stop being so confident.

701
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,760
What are you gonna do about it?

702
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,960
-And what if I do?
-I think you deserve it.

703
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,160
What are you gonna do?

704
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,840
Stop it, Pleng, don’t!

705
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
What are you gonna do?

706
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,840
Even now, you’re still acting so confident.

707
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,960
I told you not to get involved with her, didn’t I?

708
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,560
Are you okay?

709
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,760
What more do you want from me?

710
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,160
I don’t want anything.

711
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,960
I just came to warn you about Wan.

712
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,360
You shouldn’t hurt Wan.

713
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,680
Wan has already been hurt enough because of you.

714
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,760
So, did your dad kill himself

715
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,320
Because he was involved in fraud?

716
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,240
Yeah, so how’s Pleng doing now?

717
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,720
Her house was seized. Where is she staying now?

718
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,320
A shelter, maybe?

719
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,880
Do you know her?

720
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,600
The fallen rich girl?

721
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,800
This one...

722
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,640
Let me go!

723
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,720
Let me go!

724
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,120
Wan!

725
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,440
Stop, stop!

726
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,920
Stop, I said stop!

727
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,240
Stop, stop, stop right now!

728
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,640
What are you fighting about?

729
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,440
All of you, follow me to the disciplinary office.

730
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,400
Wan loves you a lot, you know.

731
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,120
Treat her better, please.

732
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,800
Before you end up with no one.

733
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,440
Pleng...

734
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,960
You...

735
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,760
Are you in a lot of pain?

736
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,640
I’m sorry for hurting you.

737
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,760
You don’t need to apologize.

738
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,520
I know you didn’t mean to.

739
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,760
You got this wound because of me, didn’t you?

740
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,440
I’m such a terrible friend.

741
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,560
I’ve hurt you so many times.

742
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,040
And now, I’m still being a burden to you.

743
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,560
How could you think that?

744
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,440
You’re not a burden to me at all.

745
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,840
If anything, I’m the one who’s been a burden to you.

746
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,440
You’ve tried to push me away so many times.

747
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,240
But I never left, did I?

748
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,040
If anyone should feel guilty,

749
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,640
It should be me.

750
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,360
And do you think

751
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,560
That when I pushed you away,

752
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,040
I really wanted to do it?

753
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,840
I don’t know.

754
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,840
You never express your feelings directly.

755
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,840
Didn’t you say you knew I loved you?

756
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,760
I don’t know.

757
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,720
But I said it to make myself feel better.

758
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,920
I’m sorry, Pleng.

759
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,520
I’m sorry for not leaving you.

760
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,000
I’ve tried,

761
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,200
But I just couldn’t.

762
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,200
Because I love you so much.

763
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,120
I love you just as much.

764
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,600
Your advisor

765
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,280
Came to talk to me.

766
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,480
About you wanting to apply for medical school.

767
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,200
I have no doubt about your abilities.

768
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,200
Because someone who consistently gets close to a 4.00 GPA

769
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,680
Will definitely get into medical school.

770
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,800
But you know, right?

771
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,800
That good grades alone aren't enough.

772
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,280
Your behavior has to be exemplary too.

773
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,320
Stay focused.

774
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,720
And don’t let something like this happen again.

775
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,800
Otherwise,

776
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,600
Your dream of becoming a doctor

777
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,320
Will come to an end.

778
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,560
You don’t have to push her away directly.

779
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,560
Just make her feel like a burden,

780
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,920
And she’ll leave on her own.

781
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,920
Why are you crying?

782
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,720
You’re better than me anyway.

783
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,720
And for those 13 years you disappeared,

784
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,160
Why did you end up like this?

785
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,080
You finally became a doctor, didn’t you?

786
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,560
Don’t touch Pleng.

787
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,800
It’s a conversation between a husband and wife, stay out of it.

788
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,200
-I’ll slap you.
-Do it, then.

789
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,520
I’ll wait for you to come home for dinner.

790
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,120
Can we skip dinner?

791
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
I’d rather eat something else.

792
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,320
Pleng, right?

793
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,640
Shooting like this, huh?

794
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,200
Today, I’ll teach you how to hold a gun.

795
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,040
(When you’re with others.)

796
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,480
What are you staring at?

797
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,880
(When you’re with others.)

798
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,080
(When you’re with me.)

799
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,520
(There, there, it’s okay.)

800
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,320
(Too sweet, can’t handle it!)

801
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,760
(Let me go.)

802
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,360
Let me go right now!

803
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,240
(There, there, I’m sorry.)
