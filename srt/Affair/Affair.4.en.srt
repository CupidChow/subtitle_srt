1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,200
I wish I had a song that you wrote for me.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,400
I've never written a song about a friend before.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,480
Just write what you're feeling.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,680
If it's love, say it's love.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,840
You're sneaking a kiss again.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,680
I can't sleep.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,880
Want me to help you sleep?

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,200
Let me help you.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,480
Dad! Dad!

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,440
Mom!

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,800
The patient passed away from…

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,640
sudden cardiac arrest.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,080
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Use this money wisely.

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,439
All of your father's assets now,

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,360
including the house you live in,

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,120
are about to be seized.

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,920
It’s probably not as comfortable here as your own home, Pleng.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
Whatever you can do on your own,

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
you’ll have to do it yourself.

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,360
I can’t help you much, Pleng,

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,520
except for letting you stay here

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,120
until you get back on your feet and move out.

23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,480
Are you done yet, Pleng?

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,520
Be careful.

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,320
Oh no, Pleng!

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Come here.

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Be careful.

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,400
Does it sting?

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
You don’t need to wash it.

30
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,160
Give it to me, I’ll wash it for you.

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
No, it’s okay, I can wash it myself.

32
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,520
No way.

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,720
Do you play guitar, Pleng?

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Why are you so startled?

35
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,920
I thought you’d stopped playing.

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
Since you’ve been here,

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,840
you haven’t touched it at all.

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
I could never give it up.

39
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,200
Because it’s the only thing I love.

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,680
And also,

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,200
it’s probably the one thing I’m best at.

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,600
So why did you suddenly pick it up to play today?

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,720
I’ve been thinking…

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,320
after school,

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,519
I’m going to busk for money.

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
Busk?

47
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,600
I’ll be able to earn some extra cash.

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,520
I’m so proud that you think like that.

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,400
And the song you’ll be playing,

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,520
is it the one you wrote for me?

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,720
No, it's not.

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
That song isn’t finished yet.

53
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,000
So when will I get to hear it?

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,200
Go on and do whatever you need to.

55
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,520
Writing a song requires focus, you know.

56
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Good luck!

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,720
My talented artist.

58
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm off now.

59
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,200
You took the competition exam, didn’t you?

60
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,400
How did it go?

61
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
It... it was nothing special.

62
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
Don’t tell me...

63
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,800
That I failed in the first round.

64
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,000
Not everyone is as talented as you.

65
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,720
-Wow, you’re really good.
-Good at what?

66
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,800
You’ll probably do about the same as last term.

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,120
Honestly, I thought I’d do even better this time.

68
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,920
And you, how did you do?

69
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,600
Not great again?

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,520
Can I take a look?

71
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
No, I’m too shy.

72
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,440
I knew it, you wouldn’t let me see again as usual.

73
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,800
Didn’t you say her dad left her some money?

74
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,720
Yeah, but it’s probably not much.

75
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
Paying tuition will probably use it all up.

76
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,080
There probably won’t be enough left to cover our living expenses.

77
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,400
Then we’ll have to find a way to get her out.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
Because if she stays,

79
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,320
she’ll just add more burden on me.

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Don’t forget, I’m the only one supporting our whole house right now.

81
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,120
I’m the only one supporting us.

82
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
If you’re not brave enough...

83
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,640
You don’t have to kick her out directly.

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,000
Just make her feel like she’s a burden.

85
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
That’ll be enough to make her leave.

86
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,520
-I already said it.
-Say it again.

87
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,159
Say it more forcefully.

88
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,720
You say it yourself.

89
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,360
You’re the one who doesn’t want her here, right?

90
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,840
Oh, come on.

91
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,280
You think I don’t know?

92
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,720
You’re the same.

93
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
You don’t like her either.

94
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,320
Like her or not, I’ve taken care of her before.

95
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
If she can’t stay here, she has nowhere else to go.

96
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,160
Let’s just do it for her parents’ sake.

97
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Let her stay here a little longer.

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Once she gets back on her feet, she’ll leave.

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,520
This is really bad.

100
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
If it gets to that point, I might as well die first.

101
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,320
Four people—how am I supposed to support them all?

102
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,600
Pleng…

103
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Don’t say anything.

104
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
I don’t want to hear it.

105
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,520
But I want to explain.

106
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,720
What you heard my parents talking about…

107
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
They might’ve…

108
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
They might’ve been stressed about money.

109
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,480
That’s why they said something without thinking.

110
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,400
Is that so?

111
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,000
How long are you going to keep lying, Wan?

112
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,120
You, your dad, and your mom.

113
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,400
Well, what is it, Wan?

114
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,720
Why are you crying?

115
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,000
You’re even better than me.

116
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,800
No, actually, I should say,

117
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,200
you’re really good at studying.

118
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,400
But me…

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,280
The stupid one.

120
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,920
For believing your lies.

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
Why did you do it, Wan?

122
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,480
For what?

123
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
I just didn’t want to compete with you.

124
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,520
What does that even mean?

125
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
We have to be together.

126
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,920
If we’re both equally good.

127
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,720
We’ll be seen as rivals.

128
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
And if that happens,

129
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
we won’t be happy together.

130
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,920
When we’re with each other.

131
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
Do you know?

132
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,720
That I’m happy every time.

133
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,720
When…

134
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,400
I see you succeed at something.

135
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,320
Happier than when I achieve something myself.

136
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,880
So I thought,

137
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
it would be best

138
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,720
if I acted like…

139
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
I can’t do anything.

140
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,600
So you can be the only one who’s great.

141
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,120
I’m sorry.

142
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,400
For what I did.

143
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,800
It’s because I love you.

144
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,800
People in love…

145
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,520
don’t do this, Wan.

146
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,920
I really…

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
can’t trust anyone.

148
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,600
Pleng…

149
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,400
Pleng…

150
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,520
You can trust me.

151
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
I’m sorry.

152
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,520
I won’t do this again. I won’t do it again.

153
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,320
Let me go, Wan.

154
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,000
No.

155
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,600
I won’t let go.

156
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,840
Not until you forgive me.

157
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,800
Please, Pleng, I’m begging you.

158
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,680
Alright.

159
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,200
I’ll forgive you.

160
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,000
You really mean it, Pleng?

161
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,400
But my feelings…

162
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,320
for you…

163
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,720
they’ll never be the same again.

164
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,120
Why are you so stressed?

165
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,000
Wan said she overheard what we were talking about.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,400
That’s actually a good thing.

167
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,280
Now we don’t have to say it ourselves.

168
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Where’s Wan?

169
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,120
She’s in her room.

170
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Aunt Wi…

171
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
Pleng is moving out of here.

172
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,400
She’s going to stay with Aunt Phen.

173
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,520
Aunt Phen, really?

174
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Your cousin, Kwan’s cousin, right?

175
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes.

176
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
Today, Pleng met with Uncle Pu and Frank.

177
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,400
Aunt Phen contacted him through Uncle.

178
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,200
She wants Pleng to stay with her.

179
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,400
But as far as I remember…

180
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,400
Pleng, you’ve only met Aunt Phen once, haven’t you?

181
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,320
Do you really know her well enough to move in with her?

182
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,600
I don’t think it’s necessary to know her that well.

183
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Because even the people I thought I knew really well

184
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,800
turned out to be strangers to me.

185
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,840
So…

186
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,720
no matter who Aunt Phen is...

187
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,520
I’m going to stay with Aunt Phen, no matter what.

188
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,320
Aunt Wi, don’t worry.

189
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
If you’re certain about this, Pleng,

190
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,520
I’ll respect your decision.

191
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
This money…

192
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,840
please keep it, Aunt Wi and Uncle Chit.

193
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,520
I set this aside from what my father gave me.

194
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,520
Consider it…

195
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,480
a thank you for letting me stay here

196
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
during this time.

197
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Thank you so much.

198
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,400
You really are kind-hearted after all.

199
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,520
At first, I thought you were going to stay here for free.

200
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
But it’s alright, really.

201
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,320
Even though you’re moving in with your aunt,

202
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,680
you should still keep some money for yourself.

203
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,520
Please keep it, Aunt Wi.

204
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,720
I truly want you to have it.

205
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,120
I don’t want to be indebted to anyone.

206
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
And I don’t want to be indebted to you, Pleng.

207
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,720
This is too much money.

208
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,120
You’ve only stayed here a few days, and it wouldn’t cost much at all.

209
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,720
There’s no need to repay us.

210
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,400
In that case…

211
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
I’ll respect your decision, Aunt Wi.

212
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Wan.

213
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,920
You have to stay strong.

214
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,000
I’ll try my best too.

215
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
Goodbye, Wan.

216
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,520
Send my regards to your parents.

217
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,120
(One year later)

218
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,200
(13 years later)

219
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,320
Yes.

220
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,800
Your girlfriend is causing a scene downstairs again.

221
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Please come down and deal with it.

222
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
-Ta.
-Pleng.

223
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,520
What are you doing here again?

224
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,600
I don’t want to break up with Pleng.

225
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,920
I love Pleng.

226
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Oh, Ta.

227
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
Can you stop saying that? It makes me want to puke.

228
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,000
Why are you being so cruel to me?

229
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,720
Because you lied to me about not having a wife.

230
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,800
And you made me your mistress without me even knowing.

231
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,320
I already apologized.

232
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,520
I explained everything to you…

233
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,520
I told you everything.

234
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,800
That what happened between me and her…

235
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,560
was just a mistake.

236
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,920
That’s all it was, Pleng.

237
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,920
Stop saying “that’s all.”

238
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,040
Because your mistake wasn’t something small.

239
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,520
It wasn’t a minor thing.

240
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,800
It’s about bringing a child into the world.

241
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,000
And that child is yours.

242
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,720
Go take care of him.

243
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,600
Pleng! Please don’t leave, Pleng.

244
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,920
-Let go of me.
-Pleng.

245
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,080
Is anyone around here?

246
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,360
Call the police!

247
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,800
-I won’t let go.
-Someone’s causing a scene!

248
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,720
Hurry up!

249
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,000
Fine, I’ll leave for now.

250
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
But remember this…

251
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,920
I’m not giving up on you, for sure.

252
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,120
Ugh, what a mess.

253
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,280
Thank you so much for helping me, Pleng.

254
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,200
It’s nothing.

255
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,280
But I’ll be honest with you…

256
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,720
I can’t let you stay here any longer.

257
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,000
Your boyfriend keeps causing disturbances like this.

258
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,400
And he doesn’t seem quite right.

259
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,880
I’m worried the other residents won’t be safe.

260
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,520
I understand.

261
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,120
Once…

262
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I can find a new place to stay.

263
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
I will…

264
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,920
Hey, hey!

265
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,680
Where did everyone around here go?

266
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,080
Someone just fainted!

267
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,400
What are you doing, patient?

268
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,680
I’m going to the bathroom.

269
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,280
If you're going to the bathroom, take the IV stand with you.

270
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,200
Doing this is very dangerous, you know?

271
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,800
Yes.

272
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,000
I’m sorry.

273
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
It’s just… I really want to go home.

274
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,480
You can’t go home yet.

275
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,080
You have the flu.

276
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,320
You’ll probably need to stay in the hospital for another 2-3 days.

277
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,320
Or maybe even longer.

278
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,200
The flu, really?

279
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,400
Yes.

280
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
But we’re not sure which strain it is yet.

281
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,880
We have to wait for the lab results.

282
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,600
Will the medical expenses be expensive?

283
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,600
We can’t say for sure yet. We need to wait for the results to see

284
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,520
if you’ll need injections or other treatments.

285
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Hey,

286
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,920
can I ask for an advance on my salary?

287
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,920
I’m in the hospital right now.

288
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
I don’t have any money to pay for the treatment.

289
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
What’s wrong?

290
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,800
I have the flu.

291
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,480
So you can’t sing then?

292
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,760
Now I have to find someone to replace you again.

293
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,800
So, about the money?

294
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,200
There’s no advance.

295
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,080
You’ll have to wait until the end of the month.

296
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,920
Please step aside, sir.

297
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,200
A 30-year-old man, hit by a car, doctor.

298
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,120
Initial vital signs: BP 85/60, Heart rate 120.

299
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,520
Oxygen saturation is 94%.

300
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,840
Please give this patient additional medication.

301
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,080
Dr. Hong, Dr. Hong!

302
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,680
Call Dr. Wan immediately. There’s an emergency case in the ER.

303
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,520
-Which Wan are you talking about?
-Wanwiwa! Come on, hurry!

304
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,920
Excuse me, does this hospital…

305
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,200
have a doctor named Wanwiwa?

306
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
Which department?

307
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,120
I’m not sure.

308
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,520
Could you check for me, please?

309
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,520
Sure.

310
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Yes, we do.

311
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,080
Dr. Wanwiwa Pipattanakul.

312
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,160
May I ask what you’re calling about?

313
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Oh, nothing.

314
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
I was just curious.

315
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,880
I wanted to know if it was someone I knew.

316
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,280
But since the last names are different, I guess not.

317
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,560
Thank you.

318
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,080
Pleng.

319
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,080
Wan.

320
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
It’s really Wan.

321
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,680
It’s been a long time, hasn’t it?

322
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,560
Must be 10 years now.

323
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,680
Not 10 years.

324
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,680
13 years.

325
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,680
13 years since you disappeared.

326
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,480
You once wrote a letter

327
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,280
saying you’d take care of yourself.

328
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,760
So why are you in this state?

329
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,960
Are you blaming me?

330
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,280
Yes.

331
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,960
I’m blaming you.

332
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,680
Why didn’t you take care of yourself?

333
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,280
How did you let yourself get this sick?

334
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,680
I didn’t let it happen.

335
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,840
If I had a choice, I wouldn’t want to be sick either.

336
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Pleng…

337
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,240
The reason I’m saying this

338
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,280
is because I care about you.

339
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,160
Can you stop making excuses?

340
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,880
The lab results are in.

341
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,560
You have a new strain of the flu.

342
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,960
You’ll need to be admitted for 2-3 days for observation.

343
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,760
After that, you can go home.

344
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,360
I have to be admitted?

345
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,960
And then…

346
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,960
Can’t I just take the medicine and go home?

347
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,760
I don’t like staying in the hospital.

348
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,760
I don’t like the atmosphere.

349
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,680
You can’t.

350
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,080
You’ll have to deal with it even if you don’t like it.

351
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,960
And no running away.

352
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,880
We’re adults now.

353
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,560
Stop being so selfish.

354
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,160
Wan…

355
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,080
You’ve changed.

356
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,160
It’s been 13 years.

357
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,760
It’d be strange if I hadn’t changed.

358
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,960
I know.

359
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
But…

360
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,840
Something about you is missing, too.

361
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,240
What?

362
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,480
Your smile.

363
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,480
Someone disappeared from my life

364
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,960
and took it with them.

365
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Hello?

366
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,880
Where are you?

367
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,960
Come back right away!

368
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,960
Your boyfriend is causing trouble again.

369
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,160
I’ve called the police to arrest him.

370
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,280
Okay, I’ll come back right now.

371
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,760
Wan…

372
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,280
I need to go home first.

373
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,280
I’m sorry.

374
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,240
You can’t get in, why?

375
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
-Hey, move aside.
-Ta.

376
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,760
Why are you here?

377
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,360
Where have you been, Pleng?

378
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,680
I’ve been sitting here waiting for you for so long.

379
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,160
Just stay out of my life.

380
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,160
No, Pleng.

381
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,960
I’ve decided to stop seeing that woman.

382
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,080
I’ll take care of my child and be the best father I can,

383
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,880
just like you wanted.

384
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,440
-Please, Pleng.
-Let go of me.

385
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,280
-I’m begging you, Pleng. Stay with me.
-I said let go!

386
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,960
I’m not letting go.

387
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,440
Don’t touch Pleng!

388
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,440
Who the hell are you?

389
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,560
-Mind your own business.
-You’re the one butting in!

390
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,680
This is a matter between a husband and wife, stay out of it.

391
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,320
-I’ll slap you.
-Go ahead.

392
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,840
Do it then.

393
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
You wanna end up in jail? Go for it.

394
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,360
I’m reporting everything—

395
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,560
trespassing, harassment, and assault.

396
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,760
You, you, all of you!

397
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,200
-What do you want?
-What are you gonna do about it?

398
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,880
Why are you meddling in my business?

399
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,960
This is between a husband and wife!

400
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,760
Before you claim someone’s your wife,

401
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
ask her if she’s willing.

402
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,720
-Yeah, exactly.
-That’s right!

403
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,280
You could also be sued for defamation, did you know that?

404
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,440
If you don’t, go study the law first,

405
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,160
so you won’t act stupid like this again.

406
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,960
You…

407
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
What’s going on here?

408
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,960
I told you not to run away, didn’t I?

409
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,480
Why won’t you listen?

410
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,360
I had no choice.

411
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,159
I don’t have the money to pay.

412
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,480
But I do.

413
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,480
I can pay for you.

414
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,080
Don’t do this, Wan.

415
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,679
You don’t need to feel sorry for me.

416
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,239
I’m not feeling sorry for you.

417
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,159
Then why are you helping me?

418
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,159
As a friend?

419
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,760
We’ve been apart for a long time, Wan.

420
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,199
You probably forgot about me already.

421
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,880
Do you think forgetting someone is easy?

422
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,360
I’m not like you.

423
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,960
For you, everything comes easy.

424
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,080
When you want to leave, you just leave.

425
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,040
And when we meet again,

426
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
you run away just as easily.

427
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,160
You’re really selfish.

428
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,680
Wan…

429
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Go back and get better.

430
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,360
If you don’t want me to help you as a friend,

431
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,040
then let me help you as a doctor.

432
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,160
And…

433
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,560
What kind of doctor pays for their patient’s treatment?

434
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,680
This doctor is right here.

435
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,880
Just for this one patient.

436
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,680
Let’s go.

437
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,560
Wan…

438
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,480
You don’t have to pay for me.

439
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,360
Just lend me the money.

440
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,080
When I get a job,

441
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,880
I’ll pay you back.

442
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,080
Dr. Wan?

443
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,080
I heard she went home to get something.

444
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,360
-Wan will take care of it from here.
-Okay.

445
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,560
What did you get?

446
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,360
Some clothes.

447
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,080
I plan to stay here overnight

448
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,760
until you get better.

449
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,360
So you won’t run off again.

450
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,480
And stop writing those notes,

451
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,280
leaving letters behind.

452
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,160
I really hate that.

453
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,440
Okay.

454
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,280
I won’t do it anymore.

455
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,880
But…

456
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,480
Are you allowed to stay here with me?

457
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,480
If someone sees, you’ll get in trouble.

458
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,360
I’m not staying here.

459
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,360
I’ll sleep in the doctor’s quarters.

460
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,960
You finally became a doctor after all.

461
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,480
And you?

462
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,480
Are you still playing music?

463
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,880
Of course.

464
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,880
But…

465
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,280
I’m not writing songs anymore.

466
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,560
Why not?

467
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,360
I play music at a bar at night.

468
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,160
By the time I’m done, it’s really late.

469
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Sometimes, I run between several bars.

470
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,360
When I get home, I just rest.

471
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,280
And it’s the same cycle, on repeat.

472
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,960
So I don’t have much time for anything else.

473
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,640
Can I ask you something?

474
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,160
What happened?

475
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,880
Why did your life turn out like this?

476
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,880
There’s nothing worth telling.

477
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
But I want to hear it.

478
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,560
My parents said you went to stay with your aunt.

479
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,080
But you didn’t, right?

480
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
No, I didn’t go stay with Aunt Phen.

481
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,560
Since I left your house,

482
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,960
I’ve been renting a room.

483
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,960
And looking for work.

484
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,960
But I didn’t finish school.

485
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,160
So no one would hire me.

486
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,040
So I ended up

487
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,080
playing music at a bar at night.

488
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,160
And the pay isn’t good?

489
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,280
Why are you in a place like that?

490
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,160
It’s not bad, really.

491
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,480
But I have to be frugal.

492
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,680
If I were to live somewhere better,

493
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,080
it would be expensive.

494
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,160
I don’t make much money, and most of it goes to rent.

495
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,960
But if I stay where I am,

496
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,640
it might be a little tough, but…

497
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
at least I have some money left over.

498
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,360
And what about that guy?

499
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,360
You used to date him, right?

500
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,360
He should be helping you out.

501
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,960
It’s better that he doesn’t, really.

502
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,560
Otherwise, he’d be harassing me even more than he already is.

503
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,080
You know…

504
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,480
His wife even came

505
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,280
to cause a scene while I was singing at the bar.

506
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,680
I’m sorry.

507
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,960
It’s because of me and my parents

508
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,680
that your life turned out this way.

509
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,480
It’s not your fault.

510
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,680
It’s just fate.

511
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,760
Besides, I think…

512
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,880
your parents probably had their reasons.

513
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,280
Eat more of your food.

514
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,160
And don’t forget to take your medicine.

515
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,680
I’ll be right back.

516
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,680
Where are you going?

517
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,960
You’re a patient.

518
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,360
How did you manage to sneak out like this?

519
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,760
I came out to follow you.

520
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,160
You say you don’t like it when I run away,

521
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,640
but you’re doing it yourself.

522
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,920
I didn’t run away.

523
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,640
I told you I’d be back.

524
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,680
I didn’t leave a letter and disappear or anything.

525
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Are you going to keep being sarcastic forever?

526
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,560
I’m thinking about it.

527
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,840
Wan…

528
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,440
Hurry up and move your things out.

529
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,120
I’m giving you 2 more days.

530
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,560
What happened?

531
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,440
It’s the owner of the flat.

532
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,960
They told me to move out within 2 days.

533
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,440
Actually…

534
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,240
I was already planning to move,

535
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,560
but two days is too fast.

536
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,160
I haven’t even thought about where to go.

537
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,840
Where should I go?

538
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,960
Why don’t you stay with me?

539
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,760
No,

540
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,560
your parents might not be comfortable with it.

541
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
I don’t live with my parents anymore.

542
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,240
I live alone.

543
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,040
Come stay with me, Pleng.

544
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,560
You live here?

545
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,720
Wow, you must be rich.

546
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,240
I’m not rich.

547
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,960
I just found a place that’s close to my work.

548
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,440
You play the piano too?

549
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,640
Do I look like someone who plays the piano?

550
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,440
Then why did you buy it?

551
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,840
I bought it for someone.

552
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,360
There's something else we have too.

553
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,760
Your voice is so beautiful.

554
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,240
But I can't tell the difference between guitar sounds.

555
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
I just know that if you're playing,

556
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,360
it's always beautiful.

557
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,240
I wish I had one.

558
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,360
Why don't you ask your dad to buy you one for your birthday?

559
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,040
No way.

560
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,240
The one I have at home is already super expensive.

561
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,560
I don't want to trouble my dad.

562
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,240
Hey...

563
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,560
ฃฃ Here you go.
ฃฃ Thank you.

564
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,040
ฃฃ Thank you so much.
ฃฃ You're welcome.

565
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,760
Let’s go home.

566
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,640
Wait...

567
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,240
It's okay.

568
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,440
If one day I become a doctor,

569
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,920
and I make lots of money,

570
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,160
I’ll buy one for you myself.

571
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,960
I’ve kept my promise, you know.

572
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,840
And don’t forget to play it for me too.

573
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,320
Why?

574
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,160
Are you missing my partner?

575
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,360
I do.

576
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,040
Your room is filled with things I like.

577
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,560
Be careful, I might stay with you for a long time.

578
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,560
It’s up to you.

579
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,440
You can stay for life if you want.

580
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,360
I wouldn’t mind.

581
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,960
But I would.

582
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,960
Just you lending me the money for my medical bills

583
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,440
already makes me feel bad.

584
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,160
I wouldn’t dare stay with you for long.

585
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,960
So what?

586
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,560
Are you going to run away from me again?

587
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,360
No.

588
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,360
I need to find a way to move forward.

589
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
You don’t have to.

590
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,560
Stay here.

591
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,240
You don’t need to run away anymore.

592
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,120
As for what you owe me,

593
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,840
I’m letting it go.

594
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,160
Wan, but…

595
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,360
Can I ask you for something?

596
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,360
Please stay here, Pleng.

597
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,760
I can’t stay…

598
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,960
if you’re going to leave my life again.

599
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,360
Don’t be dramatic, okay?

600
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,040
I’m not being dramatic.

601
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,440
I’m serious.

602
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,760
You don’t know

603
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,720
how hard life is without you in it.

604
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,840
It’s so heavy.

605
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,240
Getting through each day was a struggle.

606
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,240
It’s been so hard, Pleng.

607
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,240
I won’t argue

608
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,240
that you’ve had it tougher than me.

609
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,640
But believe me,

610
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,360
your heart hasn’t suffered as much as mine.

611
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,360
Okay.

612
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,360
I won’t go anywhere.

613
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,040
I’ll stay here with you.

614
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,240
And…

615
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,720
I’ll use everything in your room to my heart’s content.

616
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,320
And I won’t clean anything either.

617
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,440
I’ll let you do it.

618
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,360
Wan…

619
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,840
I’m going to take a shower.

620
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,840
The bra you're wearing…

621
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,560
is it the one I bought for you?

622
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,840
Why does it still look so new?

623
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,560
It’s been a long time.

624
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,560
I took good care of it.

625
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,560
And it’s one of the few things

626
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,640
you left behind for me.

627
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,440
I’m going to shower now.

628
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,760
Wan…

629
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,440
I’m sorry.

630
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,760
I’m sorry for leaving you.

631
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,640
I’m sorry that…

632
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,840
I hurt you.

633
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,560
I’m sorry that…

634
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,240
all this time, I never knew how much

635
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,640
you were hurting because of me.

636
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,760
I’m truly sorry.

637
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,040
I know

638
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,960
you probably haven’t forgiven me yet,

639
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,840
but that’s okay.

640
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,560
Since I…

641
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,440
I’ll stay here with you now.

642
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,040
I have plenty of time to make it up to you.

643
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,720
If you don’t forgive me today,

644
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,520
one day, you will.

645
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,240
You’re so confident.

646
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,440
I’m a very confident person.

647
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,560
You didn’t know that?

648
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,560
So…

649
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,960
do you want me to forgive you right now?

650
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,960
Of course.

651
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,560
What do I have to do? Just tell me.

652
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,440
Take a shower with me.

653
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,040
No, Wan.

654
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,120
Why not?

655
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,440
We used to shower together all the time when we were kids.

656
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
But now we’re grown up, Wan.

657
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,440
It’s not the same as when we were kids.

658
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,240
And besides...

659
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,120
We haven’t seen each other in so long.

660
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,760
I’m not used to it.

661
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,240
Come on, just come.

662
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,720
No, Wan, stop it.

663
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,520
Wan, what are you doing?

664
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,040
Wan…

665
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,960
Can you stay still for a moment?

666
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,160
Why?

667
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,120
Because I want to hug you.

668
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,240
I’ve missed you.

669
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,040
Are you okay, Wan?

670
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,760
Did you have a nightmare?

671
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,440
No.

672
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,560
I usually wake up around this time.

673
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,360
At 4 a.m.?

674
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,440
What do you wake up to do?

675
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,680
You should go back to sleep.

676
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,880
Are you sure you’re okay, Wan?

677
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,080
In a little while, I’ll head to work,

678
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,680
and I won’t be back until the evening.

679
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,760
Feel free to do whatever you want.

680
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,160
Eat slowly.

681
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,560
You’re going to make a mess.

682
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,360
See? You’ve already made a mess.

683
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,080
What are you doing, Wan?

684
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,960
I don’t want to waste it.

685
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,480
I’m heading to work now.

686
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,160
Are you going to work or somewhere else?

687
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,360
Why are you wearing an armband?

688
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,280
I’m going to work, of course.

689
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,560
But I’m riding my bike,

690
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,480
so I have to wear UV protection.

691
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,960
Riding a bike?

692
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,080
Like Meg Ryan.

693
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,280
The Meg Ryan you like.

694
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,960
I’m heading to work now.

695
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,640
And when I get back, I’ll collect my reward.

696
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,680
What reward?

697
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,560
Well...

698
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,160
The reward for me being Meg Ryan for you.

699
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,680
I don’t have any reward for you.

700
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,360
But I’ll wait for you to come back and have dinner with me.

701
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,160
That’s enough for me.

702
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,680
But…

703
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,760
Can we skip dinner?

704
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,880
I’d rather eat something else.

705
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,560
Stop talking nonsense, Wan.

706
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,080
Go to work before you’re late.

707
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,760
Alright, I’m going.

708
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,280
See you later.

709
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,760
You've grown up, Wan, and gotten cheeky.

710
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,760
Pleng?

711
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,560
Ek?

712
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,080
Pleng.

713
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,080
Wan.

714
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,360
It's almost 4 a.m. now.

715
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,960
This is the first time...

716
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,160
that I’ve woken up before you.

717
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,360
To write a letter telling you

718
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,760
that I’ve left.

719
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,480
I’m sorry I had to do it this way.

720
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,560
But believe me,

721
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,360
it’s for the best for everyone.

722
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,800
Your parents will feel at ease.

723
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,560
And you’ll finally get to live your life as your true self.

724
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,160
Thank you for everything.

725
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,960
And thank you for all you’ve done for me.

726
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,680
I know you love me.

727
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,160
But I also want you to love yourself.

728
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,760
And be proud of who you are.

729
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,760
It’s a shame.

730
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,960
If I had known how talented you are,

731
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,080
I would’ve celebrated with you.

732
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,160
And we both could have been happy together.

733
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,240
Because I don’t care

734
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,880
if others see us as competitors.

735
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,680
Or what others think of us.

736
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,960
The only person I care about

737
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,240
is you.

738
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Pleng…

739
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,640
Pleng…

740
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
But whatever…

741
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,640
it’ll be a new day soon.

742
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,480
Everyone has to keep living their lives.

743
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,360
You’ll have to go to school.

744
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,680
And I’ll have to go my own way.

745
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,360
To be honest, I’m scared too.

746
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,960
I don’t know what’s ahead of me.

747
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,160
But don’t worry about me.

748
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,360
I’ll take good care of myself.

749
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,680
And I’ll always think of you.

750
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,560
Oh,

751
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,280
about what I said…

752
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,760
when I told you my feelings had changed…

753
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,080
don’t believe that.

754
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,880
I only said that out of spite.

755
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,760
Because in truth,

756
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,280
no matter what happens…

757
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,440
I still love you,

758
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,880
and I’ll love you forever.

759
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,080
You look a bit stressed today.

760
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,440
If the compensation isn’t enough, you can ask for more.

761
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,760
I’ll transfer it to you.

762
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,480
Let go of me!

763
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,560
If you don’t stop,

764
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,360
I’m going to lose my patience.

765
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
And then what?

766
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,360
What are you going to do?

767
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,360
Alright, Sonya, go in.

768
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,400
(Almost became a victim)
Sonya

769
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,760
Play it cool for now.

770
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,720
(When’s the kiss happening?)

771
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,200
Get your lips ready.

772
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,480
I’m not letting go.

773
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,120
Don’t you dare touch Pleng!
(Defending with all my might)

774
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,000
Who hurt Pleng?

775
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,400
Who hurt Pleng?

776
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,360
It was you, Wan, you shook her too hard.

777
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,600
Dance to "Sorry"!

778
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,840
(The dance move I'm already good at)

779
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,080
(Is he good or what?)

780
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,480
(Jealous, jealous, jealous)

781
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,000
(Whose is it?)

782
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,160
(It's mine, of course!)
