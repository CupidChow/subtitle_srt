1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,480
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,280
I came to see Wan.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,000
-I'm staying here with Wan.
-Wan just broke up with me.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,200
What happened between you two?

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,000
Why’d you break up?

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,800
Ek cheated on me.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,600
This is my family’s hotel, by the way.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,880
I’d love for you to come and perform here.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
It’s way better than busking, don’t you think?

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,120
Earth is a producer here.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,520
I want the two of you to get to know each other.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,200
You might work together in the future.

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,320
I broke up with Wan.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,080
But we haven't filed for divorce yet.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,200
So, does that mean Wan's new guy...

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,600
Is he a lover?

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,600
If you know who it is, could you tell me?

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,720
And what would you do if you found out?

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,200
I'd kill him.

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,720
Aren't you going to play music today?

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,920
Have you eaten yet?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,920
Not yet.

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,400
I don't feel like eating much.

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,000
Why?

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Are you feeling unwell?

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
Let me take a look.

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,800
Wan

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Why didn’t you ever tell me

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
that you and Ek are already married?

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,600
Yes.

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
But I’m filing for divorce.

32
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,400
Then why didn’t you tell me before?

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,520
Like I said, it’s already over.

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
If you haven’t divorced yet, it’s not over, Wan.

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Legally, that’s true.

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
But in terms of feelings,

37
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,480
it’s a different matter.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Then why did you tell Ek that you have someone new?

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,520
Because I really do.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
So,

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,920
that person is an affair, right?

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,920
We haven’t done anything.

43
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,200
So, you can’t really call it an affair.

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,200
Wan,

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
I’m serious.

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,920
Ek told me he’s going to kill that person.

47
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,400
Someone like Ek

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,400
wouldn’t do something like that.

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,320
Who knows?

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,880
Someone who loses what they love

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
is capable of doing anything.

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,200
I’m scared, Wan.

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
What are you afraid of?

54
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,320
Are you…

55
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,520
my new lover?

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,520
You already know

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
who I’m talking about.

58
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
It’s obvious.

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Well, no.

60
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,640
You’re not someone new.

61
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,680
But you’re the same person—

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,600
the first

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,400
and the only one I love.

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,120
So…

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,680
no matter what happens,

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
I’ll protect you with my life.

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,720
Just stay by my side,

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,320
and don’t disappear again.

69
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,600
Can you?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,120
Pleng?

71
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,120
Wan.

72
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
That’s not nice.

73
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,600
How could you sneak a look at someone’s stuff?

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,320
I didn’t sneak a look; I was fully intent on it!

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,800
Well, still…

76
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,480
Didn’t you say you weren’t going to write any more songs?

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,600
Isn’t this your songwriting notebook?

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,200
I just started writing again since I’ve been with you.

79
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,000
But…

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,320
You didn’t see anything inside just now, did you?

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don’t know…

82
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
Not telling.

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Wan.

84
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:53,320
This song isn’t for anyone else.

85
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,600
-It’s your song.
-Wan!

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,600
Just like how I belong to you.

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,080
Finish writing it soon, okay?

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,000
I’ve been waiting to hear it.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,320
Been waiting for 13 years, too.

90
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,720
You’re so naughty.

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,320
I’ll head to work now.

92
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Aunt Wi.

93
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Pleng.

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,920
Hello.

95
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,320
How did you end up here?

96
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
Wan invited me.

97
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,120
When did you and Wan start meeting again?

98
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,200
And why does Wan trust you enough to let you stay in this room?

99
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
We only just reconnected recently.

100
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,000
But as for trust…

101
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
We’ve been friends, you know.

102
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Just because we’ve been apart for a long time…

103
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,800
doesn’t mean our feelings for each other had to change.

104
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,600
Exactly.

105
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
You’ve been gone for so long.

106
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,920
So why did you come back?

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,800
Can’t you see that without you…

108
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Wan's life has gotten so much better?

109
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,320
I can see that.

110
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,600
But not everything is better, right?

111
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,200
And what’s not better?

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Her family.

113
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,800
I’ve heard that…

114
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,000
Wan and her husband are getting divorced.

115
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,120
He even asked Pleng for help.

116
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,520
And did Pleng help?

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
No.

118
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,400
It’s none of my business.

119
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,800
That’s good.

120
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
In that case, it would be better if you stayed away from Wan.

121
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,800
Sometimes, without you,

122
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
they might reconcile with each other.

123
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
And what does that have to do with me, Aunt Wi?

124
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
It has everything to do with you.

125
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,760
Because when Wan has you,

126
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,800
she doesn’t see anyone else but you.

127
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
In the past 10 years,

128
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,800
Wan has suffered enough because you disappeared.

129
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,920
So, if you leave one more time,

130
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,400
Wan wouldn’t feel more pain than she already has.

131
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I’m heading out for a bit.

132
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,200
Excuse me for a moment.

133
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,320
Pleng.

134
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
You’ve met Wan’s mother, haven’t you?

135
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
So, you knew that Aunt Wi came here?

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,520
I was the one who picked her up.

137
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,120
To help with Wan.

138
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,520
Since you refused to help me.

139
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,320
And you think Aunt Wi will be able to help?

140
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
She’s her mother, after all.

141
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,920
At the very least, Wan might listen to her.

142
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,800
Wan doesn’t listen to anyone.

143
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
You’re the one who needs to listen to her and go through with the divorce.

144
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,000
And let her move on.

145
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,400
No.

146
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
I won't divorce.

147
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,880
I’m not going to let Wan be with that lover.

148
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
But Wan doesn’t love you anymore.

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,520
Even if you manage to bring her back,

150
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,720
it will only be her body.

151
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,480
In the end, your relationship with Wan

152
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,720
will go back to the way it was.

153
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,520
Can you really handle that?

154
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
I can.

155
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Even if I end up lonelier,

156
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,800
more worthless,

157
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,520
I’ll endure it.

158
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
Because I love Wan so much.

159
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,680
I’m not ready to lose her yet.

160
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,080
See you at the hotel then.

161
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
Pleng!

162
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,000
Pleng!

163
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,320
Pleng!

164
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
Where are you, Pleng?

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
Pleng!

166
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,920
Mom, where is Pleng?

167
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,400
Did you let her stay here with you?

168
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm asking you, where is Pleng?

169
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,800
I don’t know!

170
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,920
I only saw her for a second when I got here.

171
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,120
We talked for a bit, and she went out.

172
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
How would I know where she went?

173
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,200
What did you talk about with her?

174
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,800
Is this really the time to be worrying about someone else?

175
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,200
Focus on sorting out your own life first.

176
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,600
How could you tell Ek you’ve got someone new?

177
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,800
Do you actually have someone new?

178
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,200
Or were you just trying to make him believe it?

179
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,520
You don’t need to know that.

180
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
I’ve told you before.

181
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,680
I’m grown up now.

182
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,320
If it’s not necessary,

183
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,200
stay out of my life.

184
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,720
But it is necessary!

185
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,400
If you really do have someone new,

186
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,000
whoever it is, you need to break up with them.

187
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
And go back to Ek.

188
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,920
He’s never treated you badly the whole time you’ve been together.

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,880
He made one mistake, you should be able to forgive him.

190
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,720
One mistake for some people, Mom,

191
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
can ruin their whole life.

192
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
Just like what you did to me.

193
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,600
And to Pleng.

194
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,680
So you have no right to tell me

195
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,320
how I should handle my love life.

196
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,400
I’ll make that decision myself.

197
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,800
Hey!

198
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,200
Don’t be stupid.

199
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,520
You’ll never find anyone better than Ek.

200
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,200
I don’t need someone perfect.

201
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,320
I need someone who loves me.

202
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,920
And I love him.

203
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,720
And I’ve found him already.

204
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
I’ve known for a long time.

205
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,120
-Hello?
-Where are you?

206
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,120
I’m just out for a walk.

207
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,000
Where? Should I come meet you?

208
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,400
No, don’t bother.

209
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,320
You’ve got to get back to work soon anyway.

210
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,520
It’s a waste of time.

211
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,400
Okay, I won’t come then.

212
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,320
But, Pleng…

213
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,520
You met my mom, right?

214
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,520
It’s nothing, really.

215
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,800
You don’t have to worry.

216
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Of course I’m worried.

217
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,920
I’m scared she’ll scare you off again.

218
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,400
She won’t.

219
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,920
I already promised you, didn’t I?

220
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,400
I’m not going to run away.

221
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,400
If I ever leave, I’ll tell you straight up.

222
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,120
Pleng…

223
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,400
I’m just joking.

224
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,800
Go back to work.

225
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,120
Don’t worry, okay?

226
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,800
I just need some time alone for a bit.

227
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
I’ll text you later.

228
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,320
-Sorry, man.
-Watch where you’re going, man!

229
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,680
Stop.

230
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,920
What do you think you’re doing?

231
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,520
Your friend got drunk and started messing with me first.

232
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,480
Wait, hold on a second!

233
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,120
I’m sorry on behalf of my friend.

234
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
But please, don’t start a fight with him.

235
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,520
Do you even know who he is? He owns this place.

236
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,800
If something happens, it’s going to get out of hand.

237
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,920
Fine, we’re leaving!

238
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,400
Let’s go.

239
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Sit here!

240
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,480
You’re in bad shape, my friend.

241
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,119
It’s not even showtime yet.

242
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,520
Come have a drink with us first.

243
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,119
You too, man.

244
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,400
I think you’ve had enough already.

245
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,800
Doing this isn’t going to fix anything.

246
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,200
I just don’t know what else to do.

247
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,000
You’re right about that.

248
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
Even Wan’s mom can’t help me anymore.

249
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,400
I guess I’ve really hit rock bottom.

250
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,120
If I agree to help you,

251
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,400
will you stop acting like this?

252
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
Pleng…

253
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
What did you say?

254
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,720
I’ll help you talk to Wan.

255
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
But you’ve got to stop wrecking yourself like this.

256
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,000
Pleng...

257
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,880
Are you serious?

258
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
You’re not messing with me, right?

259
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,880
But I’ll only help

260
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,320
get you two talking again.

261
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,800
After that, it’s on you.

262
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,800
And it all depends on...

263
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,920
It also depends on what Wan decides.

264
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,000
But you have to respect her decision, whatever it is.

265
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,880
No matter how it turns out,

266
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
you’ve got to accept it.

267
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,320
I’ll help you too.

268
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Sometimes words aren’t enough, though.

269
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,000
You might need to do something bigger than that.

270
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
So Wan knows

271
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,920
you really love her,

272
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,320
and want her back.

273
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
Wan.

274
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,200
Wan.

275
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,880
Wan, Wan.

276
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,400
Yesterday you were thinking about Ek.

277
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,600
And today, I bet you’re thinking about your mom.

278
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,200
If you’re always going to be thinking about other people,

279
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
maybe we shouldn’t even be together.

280
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,200
Wait, Wan!

281
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,120
I’m not thinking about other people.

282
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,280
I just…

283
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,800
I was thinking

284
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
about finding time to take you out to dinner.

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,800
What?

286
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,480
I just got my first paycheck.

287
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,680
So I wanted to treat you to something nice.

288
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,400
If you’re going to ask me out to dinner,

289
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,520
you could’ve made it sound a bit more exciting.

290
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,120
So, what else do I have to do?

291
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,920
Why don’t you think about it?

292
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,400
What I might want you to do.

293
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,400
...might want you to do.

294
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,680
That’s it?

295
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,120
That’s already a lot.

296
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,000
Don’t ask for too much.

297
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,920
Fine.

298
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,920
This is fine.

299
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,800
It’s better than nothing.

300
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,600
Wait...

301
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,720
Can you wait here for a second?

302
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
I’ll be right back.

303
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
-Where are you going?
-Just wait, I’ll be right back.

304
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,320
I’m sorry, Wan.

305
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,400
Come back to me, please.

306
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,120
I told you, didn’t I?

307
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,600
That I’m going to divorce no matter what.

308
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,680
But I don’t want a divorce.

309
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,920
Then get ready to receive court papers.

310
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,120
If you want to make this a big deal.

311
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,960
Consider it done.

312
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,400
Give Ek another chance, please.

313
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,800
Ek really loves you.

314
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
This isn’t your business.

315
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,000
Stay out of it.

316
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,800
But Ek’s my friend.

317
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,520
I’ve got to help him.

318
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,400
Just like Pleng is trying to help you.

319
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,520
Pleng didn’t do it willingly.

320
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,600
She’s forcing herself.

321
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,200
I know that.

322
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,520
Wan,

323
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,600
please don’t leave me.

324
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,320
I can’t live without you.

325
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
Can’t live?

326
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,400
So what?

327
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
You gonna die?

328
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,920
Yes, I will.

329
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,520
Go ahead, then.

330
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
I’m curious to see.

331
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,120
Let’s see if you can really die.

332
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
It’s because of them, right?

333
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,800
Your new person, Wan.

334
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
That’s why you won’t give me another chance.

335
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
Who is it, Wan?

336
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
Who is this person?

337
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
They’re the one

338
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,800
who made me decide to marry you.

339
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,800
I married you to keep the promise I made to them.

340
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,800
And if they weren’t in my life anymore,

341
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,800
you’d be the only one I’d be with.

342
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,400
Even though

343
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,200
I’ve never loved you.

344
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,600
Are you going to stay here

345
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,320
with someone you just met,

346
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
or come home with me, Pleng?

347
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,120
Do you think

348
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,720
we should keep talking?

349
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,600
I don’t think so anymore.

350
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,000
But it’s good that you brought it up.

351
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,080
I really want to know,

352
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,120
when are you going to stop acting like this?

353
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,320
I didn’t mean to, Wan.

354
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
-I just wanted to...
-That’s not it.

355
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,720
I’m not talking about you helping Ek.

356
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,000
What I mean is...

357
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,320
When are you going to stop doing things that go against your own feelings?

358
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720
I’ve told you to think about your own happiness first.

359
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,000
Why don’t you ever listen to me?

360
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,600
But some things...

361
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,080
It’s hard to only think about yourself, isn’t it?

362
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
What do you want me to do?

363
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,200
I’ve told Ek I want a divorce...

364
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
I’ve told Ek hundreds of times.

365
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,920
But Ek won’t agree.

366
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,600
So does that mean I have to suffer with Ek for the rest of my life?

367
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,600
No, that’s not what I’m saying.

368
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,000
I don’t want you to do that.

369
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,200
But you could talk to him calmly, couldn’t you?

370
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,840
That thing you said to Ek about dying,

371
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,800
I think that was a bit too much.

372
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,200
Because I know...

373
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I’ve always tried to be kind when talking to Ek.

374
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
But the kinder I am,

375
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,800
the more hope Ek gets.

376
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,920
And the longer he ends up hurting.

377
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,600
Sometimes, a sharp pain that ends quickly

378
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,800
might be better.

379
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,120
But I think that...

380
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
Enough, Pleng.

381
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,600
Stop getting involved in this.

382
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,600
Seriously,

383
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,320
this isn’t even your business.

384
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Okay.

385
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,400
I understand.

386
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,520
I’m sorry.

387
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
From now on, I won’t interfere with your life anymore.

388
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
Don’t be sarcastic with me.

389
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,520
I’m not being sarcastic.

390
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,200
In this situation,

391
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,000
what do you think I can do?

392
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
Tell me, please.

393
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,120
You...

394
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,600
Wan...

395
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,400
Wan...

396
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
That’s enough.

397
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,120
I don’t want to do this anymore.

398
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,400
But I want to.

399
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Wan...

400
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,000
I can’t do this.

401
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,320
We can do this.

402
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,320
You just need to let go.

403
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,920
Let go of what?

404
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,600
You know what we’re doing is wrong.

405
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
If we keep moving forward,

406
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,640
there’s no turning back, Wan.

407
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,600
If we can’t turn back, then we move forward.

408
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,800
Ever since I came back and saw you...

409
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,920
I’ve decided I’m not turning back anymore.

410
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,920
Wait, Wan...

411
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,600
I can’t do this.

412
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,920
I don’t want to be...

413
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,320
Then just stay still.

414
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,320
I’ll take care of it.

415
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,000
Wan, can you stop being so selfish?

416
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,800
You know what I mean.

417
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,600
Do you remember the promise you made to me?

418
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,000
You said,

419
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,600
if I graduated as a doctor,

420
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
I could ask for anything and you’d give it to me.

421
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,200
Why are you bringing this up now?

422
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,120
Because I know now

423
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,800
what I want.

424
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,600
What do you want?

425
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,000
I want you.

426
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,320
Wan...

427
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,120
Wan...

428
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,120
No, Wan, we can’t.

429
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,400
We’re friends, Wan.

430
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,200
All this time...

431
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,120
we’ve crossed the line too far already.

432
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,200
That’s enough.

433
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
I understand now.

434
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,800
Chasing after someone who keeps running away

435
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
is exhausting.

436
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,200
I’d like to have a drink today, too.

437
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,800
Sure.

438
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
One glass, please.

439
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,080
I’m sorry.

440
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,720
I couldn’t help you at all.

441
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,520
It’s okay.

442
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,120
By the way,

443
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,800
why did you ask for a drink?

444
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,200
Is something stressing you out?

445
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,920
Did you have a fight with Wan or something?

446
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,600
I think I might need to find a new place to stay.

447
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,800
No way.

448
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,200
Wan’s not going to let you disappear.

449
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,000
Wan’s been looking for you all this time.

450
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,800
Wan really loves you.

451
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,400
She loves you a lot.

452
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,920
Sometimes I even wonder...

453
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,600
if the person Wan always talks about

454
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,000
is you, Pleng.

455
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,000
Don’t be ridiculous.

456
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,280
Wan and I are just friends.

457
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,600
No matter what, I’m still jealous.

458
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,200
Even though you ran away for so long,

459
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,400
when you came back,

460
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,200
Wan still gave you a chance to be together again.

461
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,320
But when it comes to me,

462
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
I made one mistake,

463
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,800
and Wan won’t even give me a chance.

464
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,520
I feel like...

465
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,400
I’m completely worthless in Wan’s eyes.

466
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,200
Don’t blame yourself.

467
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,000
You didn’t do anything wrong, Ek.

468
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
Then why does Wan love you so much?

469
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,520
Why does Wan still love

470
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,120
someone who’s hurt her for 13 years?

471
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,320
Do you know?

472
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,400
Ever since you left,

473
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,000
there hasn’t been a single day

474
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
where Wan smiled,

475
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,800
or laughed.

476
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,000
Wan’s been nothing but sad,

477
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,679
constantly blaming herself,

478
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,719
thinking it’s her fault

479
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,520
that you had to struggle alone.

480
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,280
Where is Pleng?

481
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,280
But even so,

482
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,400
Wan still thinks about you all the time.

483
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,600
Wan...

484
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,080
I miss Pleng.

485
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,120
I miss Pleng.

486
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,480
I’ll help you find her.

487
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,600
Still trying to do everything

488
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,920
she promised she would do for you.

489
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,000
Still going everywhere.

490
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,920
Going to places where she thought you might be,

491
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,800
hoping to run into you.

492
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,200
Every day,

493
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,000
Wan wakes up startled at 4:00 a.m.,

494
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,000
because that’s the time you left her.

495
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,000
She’s been stuck on it,

496
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,600
holding onto it like a trauma.

497
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,000
Why does she wake up at that same time, again and again?

498
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,400
Pleng,

499
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,400
you’re in every part of Wan’s feelings,

500
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,320
never gone for even a second.

501
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,120
So, I’ll be leaving now.

502
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Are you going to see Wan?

503
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,600
Yes, I’m going to see her right now.

504
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,200
There’s no need to rush that much.

505
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,280
I don’t want to wait anymore.

506
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,000
I don’t want to make Wan suffer because of me anymore.

507
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,200
I’m going now.

508
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,920
I told you, Guy, I need a break.

509
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,800
Don’t come looking for me yet.

510
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,520
And if you’re coming in,

511
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,520
you should knock first.

512
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,000
This isn’t a home,

513
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,520
so anyone can come in, right?

514
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,120
No need to knock.

515
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,400
If you want privacy,

516
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
then come home and sleep with me.

517
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
Who said anyone can come in?

518
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
This room is for doctors only.

519
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,600
Who gave you permission to enter?

520
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
No one did.

521
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,800
I snuck in by myself.

522
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,200
That’s terrible.

523
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,720
Then you should blame yourself first.

524
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,000
Because last time...

525
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,080
the reason I got into this room

526
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,120
was because you snuck me in.

527
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,120
Come home with me, Wan.

528
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,120
You left me to sleep alone for a night already.

529
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,920
Isn’t that a good thing?

530
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,120
But do you even think about anything?

531
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,320
No, I don’t.

532
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,800
I only think about one thing.

533
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,920
And that’s thinking about you.

534
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,000
I’m here to make up.

535
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,200
Come home with me, Wan.

536
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,320
You’re making up

537
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,920
because you’re scared of getting kicked out, aren’t you?

538
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,600
No, that’s not it.

539
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,520
It’s because I love you.

540
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,920
And also...

541
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,720
I want to keep the promise I made to you.

542
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,120
If you want me,

543
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
I’ll give myself to you.

544
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,560
Have you been drinking wine?

545
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,080
Yes.

546
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,080
You don’t like it? I can go rinse my mouth.

547
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,080
No need.

548
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,080
I like it.

549
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,960
It’s sexy.

550
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,560
Wan...

551
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,960
Say it louder.

552
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,360
So I know

553
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,280
how much you really want it.

554
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,960
Do you like it?

555
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
Of course I do.

556
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,480
But...

557
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,480
I still feel like it’s not really fair.

558
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,880
How so?

559
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,560
Well...

560
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,760
I’ve given myself to you.

561
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,680
So you have to be mine, too.

562
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,280
I know now.

563
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,480
Why you always wake up at 4:00 a.m.

564
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,280
How do you know?

565
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,680
It doesn’t matter how I know.

566
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,360
Just know that I feel really bad

567
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,480
for being the reason you have that trauma.

568
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,160
From now on...

569
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,240
Can you create a new memory of it?

570
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,080
At 4:00 a.m.

571
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,360
It won’t be the time I left you anymore.

572
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,080
But the time when

573
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,560
we became each other’s.

574
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,880
I can’t do that.

575
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,360
Because it was already over before 4:00 a.m.

576
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,360
If you really want to change that memory,

577
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,880
we have to start again.

578
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,360
Right now.

579
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,880
Did you come to see me for a reason?

580
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,360
No.

581
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,560
I was just out for a walk around here,

582
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,360
so I thought I’d stop by to see you.

583
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,840
Really?

584
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,360
It’s not because

585
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,560
you missed me so much that you couldn’t stand it?

586
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,680
I missed you.

587
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,040
You missed me?

588
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
Or did you miss what we did together?

589
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,160
Doctor Wan’s friend.

590
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,760
Hello, we meet again.

591
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,280
Pleng.

592
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,960
Guy.

593
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,160
Stop meddling, Guy.

594
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,760
Meddling? I just want to get to know your friend.

595
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,680
Last time we met, we didn’t even talk.

596
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,560
Understand this.

597
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,760
Back then, we were friends.

598
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,240
But now,

599
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,760
we’re not anymore.

600
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,760
So what?

601
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,760
This is Pleng.

602
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,880
-My girlfriend.
-Wan!

603
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,080
Got it.

604
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,240
So in the doctor's lounge...

605
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,160
-That day was...
-Excuse me, I’ll be taking Wan with me now.

606
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,160
Come here right now.

607
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,360
How could you say that?

608
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,960
You haven’t even divorced Ek yet.

609
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,280
How can you go around telling people we’re a couple?

610
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,440
Then what should I say?

611
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,960
Friends don’t do things like that.

612
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,080
You’re the one who said it yourself.

613
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,680
-But...
-Don’t worry about it.

614
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,600
I’ve waited a long time for this day.

615
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,280
I’ve always loved you, Pleng.

616
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,160
The kind of love that’s...

617
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,680
not just friends loving friends.

618
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,760
And I know,

619
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,080
you feel the same way as I do.

620
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,560
You’re just too afraid to admit the truth.

621
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,280
And I didn’t want to pressure you.

622
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,160
Honestly, if we had been braver back then,

623
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,880
we would’ve been together a long time ago.

624
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,560
We wouldn’t have had to wait this long.

625
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,560
I think it’s time.

626
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,080
Time for us to face the truth

627
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,760
and make it clear once and for all.

628
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,080
Besides, when we’re together...

629
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,480
...when we’re intimate...

630
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,440
Wan!

631
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,080
You won’t just call my name anymore.

632
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,680
But you’ll call me

633
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,080
-“darling.”
-Are you crazy?

634
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,880
We’re in public, you know.

635
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,760
“Darling, darling, darling.”

636
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,760
It’s cute, though.

637
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,480
“Darling.”

638
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,560
How have you been? I haven’t seen you in days.

639
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,360
But Ek’s not coming today.

640
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,280
I know.

641
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,760
He’s probably taking some time to heal.

642
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,760
But I’m not here for Ek today.

643
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,080
I came to see you.

644
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,480
Did you write this song yourself?

645
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,760
I really like it.

646
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,760
Can I buy it from you?

647
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,960
I was thinking of rearranging it,

648
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,440
and doing some mixing and mastering.

649
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,480
It would turn out perfect.

650
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,680
Sorry,

651
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,360
I’m not selling it.

652
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,880
I wrote it for my partner.

653
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,280
That doesn’t matter.

654
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,000
Whether you wrote it for your partner

655
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,360
or for anyone else,

656
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,160
I don’t care.

657
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,480
I only care that the song has value

658
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,880
and can be developed further.

659
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,080
I just think

660
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,760
it’d be a waste for you to keep it between just you and your partner.

661
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,280
You’ll get something out of it.

662
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,240
Hey,

663
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,040
I’m asking you seriously.

664
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,160
The reason you’re trying to approach me...

665
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,160
is it because Ek asked you to?

666
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,280
Yes, Ek asked me.

667
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
But if I wasn’t interested in you,

668
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,480
I wouldn’t be standing here right now.

669
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,080
I’m interested in you as a producer,

670
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,880
and as a man.

671
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,480
But if you already have a partner, that’s okay.

672
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,680
I still want to work with you regardless.

673
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,760
Are you sure?

674
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,360
That you can keep things separate?

675
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,040
If I were someone obsessed with women,

676
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,360
putting them before work...

677
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,560
By now, I’d have a girlfriend in every corner of the city.

678
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,480
So when will you stop being so confident?

679
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,080
Let’s say around 2:00 a.m., sounds about right.

680
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,160
Khun Earth.

681
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,160
Got it, Khun Pleng.

682
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,480
Here’s the deal...

683
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,160
I think you should go back and think it over.

684
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,760
What was the reason that made you start playing music?

685
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,080
If it’s your dream,

686
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,760
then I think it’s time to follow that dream.

687
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,640
And I’ll be the one to take you there.

688
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,360
Just say whatever it is you want to say.

689
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,640
If I…

690
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,080
wanted to take on more work,

691
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,360
would you be okay with that?

692
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,480
What kind of work?

693
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,280
Making music with Earth.

694
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,960
Wan…

695
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,960
I know that…

696
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,080
you don’t want me to do it.

697
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,680
Of course not.

698
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,760
I can tell that guy likes you.

699
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,160
Otherwise, he wouldn’t be bothering you like this.

700
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,680
But I don’t like him.

701
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,080
I really just want to work.

702
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,280
Fine,

703
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,280
do whatever you want.

704
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,440
If that’s what you want,

705
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,680
I won’t stop you.

706
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,160
Besides,

707
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
we’re already in a relationship.

708
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,280
I don’t want to keep fighting with you all the time.

709
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,680
It’s toxic.

710
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,760
Thank you.

711
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,360
But...

712
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,560
there has to be a condition.

713
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,360
You have to go on a honeymoon with me first.

714
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,280
Honeymoon?

715
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,560
Yes.

716
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,480
If we’re in a relationship, we have to go on a honeymoon.

717
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,280
That’s when it’ll be official.

718
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,560
Do you remember the beach...

719
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,960
that your dad took us to when we were kids?

720
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,960
Of course, I remember.

721
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,760
I want to go there.

722
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,560
After my birthday,

723
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,360
and once I can take some time off,

724
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,680
let’s go together.

725
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,160
Is something wrong?

726
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,080
I miss my mom and dad.

727
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,640
How should I comfort my darling?

728
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,080
Are you being sweet today, Way?

729
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,760
Don’t you like it?

730
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,760
I do.

731
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,880
But I’m just not used to it.

732
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,160
In that case,

733
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,560
let’s stick to the usual.

734
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,240
Smells so good.

735
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,840
Come here, I’ll feed you.

736
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,240
Do you remember

737
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,440
what today is?

738
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,520
Today?

739
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,640
It’s Friday.

740
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,360
And what else?

741
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,440
What else is today?

742
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,240
Is it the last Friday of the month?

743
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,360
Oh, or is it

744
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,440
Friday the 13th?

745
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,640
I’m not talking to you anymore.

746
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,360
Wait, hold on.

747
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,840
Tell me what today is first!

748
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,040
If you can’t figure it out,

749
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,360
then never mind.

750
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,760
How could I not remember?

751
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,520
It’s your birthday today!

752
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,040
What’s up, Ek?

753
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,040
I’m at the lobby.

754
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,640
Come down and see me, Pleng.

755
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,520
Okay.

756
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,960
Heard you took another day off today?

757
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,960
But I submitted my leave request in advance.

758
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,360
Are you going to celebrate your birthday with Wan?

759
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,960
What happened to your finger?

760
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,760
I cut it with a knife.

761
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,560
That’s not good.

762
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,440
Because someone like you

763
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,360
probably uses your fingers a lot.

764
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,040
What do you mean?

765
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,360
Well, you’re a musician,

766
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,960
aren’t you?

767
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,360
Let me ask you straight.

768
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,320
Why did you come to see me?

769
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,240
What exactly do you want from me?

770
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,360
If it’s just about taking time off,

771
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,840
then that’s already settled, right?

772
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,360
I’m going to go now.

773
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,840
Earth told me you have a partner already.

774
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,040
Who’s your partner?

775
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,240
And does Wan know?

776
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,440
I don’t have one.

777
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,360
I just said that as a precaution,

778
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,960
in case Earth tries to flirt with me.

779
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,040
Why?

780
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,640
I thought…

781
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,840
you and Earth

782
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,040
would make a good match.

783
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,840
If you and Earth got together,

784
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,160
you could finally move out of here.

785
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,240
And I think…

786
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,240
you’ve been with Wan for too long.

787
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,360
Ek…

788
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,640
What are you trying to tell me?

789
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,040
Nothing at all.

790
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,560
I wasn’t going to say anything.

791
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,440
I’m just trying to be considerate.

792
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,160
I want you to have a life of your own.

793
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,960
You and Wan are friends,

794
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,920
but you can’t stay attached to each other forever.

795
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,760
Thanks for your concern.

796
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,960
But this is my life,

797
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,840
and I can make my own decisions.

798
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,960
Surprise!

799
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,360
So you did remember after all.

800
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,240
I never forgot.

801
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,840
It’s your birthday, after all.

802
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,040
Have you seen the cake yet?

803
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,640
Do you like it?

804
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,160
What happened to your finger?

805
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,320
I was making a cake for you.

806
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,160
But not this one.

807
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,240
While I was making it,

808
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,840
I accidentally cut my finger with the knife.

809
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,440
I figured it wouldn’t turn out well, so I ordered this one instead.

810
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,640
I’m sorry, Wan.

811
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,040
Poor you.

812
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,040
Actually,

813
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,040
you didn’t have to make me a cake.

814
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,920
Because I don’t really want to eat it.

815
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,240
But I’d rather eat you.

816
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,960
Then go ahead and eat.

817
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,440
It’s your birthday today, after all.

818
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,160
Make sure you’re satisfied.

819
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,640
You two should die.

820
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,080
Ek!

821
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,160
I’m leaving now, Mom.

822
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,360
Wan...

823
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,840
Now that your father has passed,

824
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,840
come back and stay with me.

825
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,640
I don’t want to be alone.

826
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,640
I’ve told you before,

827
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,040
I’m never coming back to live here again.

828
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,640
And unless it’s necessary,

829
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,640
stay out of my life.

830
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,160
But I’m your mother, Wan.

831
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,160
How long will you keep punishing me for someone else’s mistakes?

832
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,240
Pleng is not just someone else.

833
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,760
She’s the person I love.

834
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,760
So there’s that.

835
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,120
Don’t you love me at all?

836
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,640
It’s you, Mom,

837
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,240
who doesn’t love me.

838
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,240
If you really loved me,

839
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,960
you wouldn’t have treated Pleng that way.

840
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,040
You would’ve been kind to her,

841
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,280
both in front of me and behind my back.

842
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,120
Because you should’ve known

843
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,960
how important she is to me.

844
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,560
But whatever.

845
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,240
Talking about it won’t change anything.

846
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,040
I’ve already lost Pleng.

847
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,440
And you’re going to pay for it.

848
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,960
By losing me as well.

849
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,760
If you still can’t accept the truth,

850
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,360
then that’s your problem.

851
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,280
Do you want to know what the truth is?

852
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,480
And who exactly can’t handle it?

853
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,480
There are some things

854
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,880
that make it impossible for Wan and I to be together right now.

855
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,359
There's an urgent document for you.

856
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:18,680
Whose test results are these?

857
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:21,160
Oh, you...

858
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:22,960
Didn’t you say you were moving in with me?

859
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,279
I want Wan

860
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,960
to give me a chance to take care of her.

861
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:32,760
If Wan ends up with no money and I have no one...

862
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,160
I think I’m scared.
(Just practicing)

863
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,359
But I want to play.

864
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:38,240
Someone’s being possessive.

865
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:39,160
Do you have kids?

866
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,760
How could I?

867
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,080
This is a doll.

868
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,359
Start with a kiss.

869
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,640
Lift the shirt first.

870
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,840
Lift the shirt.

871
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,479
The shirt just fell.

872
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,040
Mmm.

873
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:53,720
Okay, okay.

874
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,080
(Someone’s being clingy.)

875
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:02,960
Okay.

876
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,160
(Playfully shipping.)

877
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,200
(Getting dreamy.)

878
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,479
(Ticklish.)

879
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,000
(The scene is intense.)
