1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,320
You're always on my mind, Pleng.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,640
Not even for a second have you ever left.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,880
I don’t want to hurt her because of me anymore.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,720
If you want me, I’m all yours.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,200
It’s time now.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,720
We need to face the truth and be brave.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,720
And finally make things clear.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,200
This is Pleng,

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,120
-My girlfriend.
-Wan.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,880
Do you remember the beach your dad took us to when we were kids?

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,120
I want to go there.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
It’s not because I want cake,

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,120
But because I want you more.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
You can have all of me.

15
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,920
Both of you should die.

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,400
Ek.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
Don’t hurt Pleng.

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,120
If you have to do it,

19
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,919
Then do it to me alone.

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
So that really is Pleng, huh?

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,720
The one you’ve loved for so long.

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
Before you even met me.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
Yeah, that’s right.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,520
Pleng is the one I love.

25
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,920
Then why did you marry me?

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
I already told you.

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,320
I married to keep the promise I made to Pleng.

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,520
And I thought that

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,120
If Pleng saw the news of our wedding,

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,520
-She would come back.
-That’s enough.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,200
Stop hurting me, please.

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
I stopped a long time ago, Ek.

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,400
It’s you who hasn’t stopped.

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
It’s you who’s hurting yourself.

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,120
I told you, didn’t I?

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
That if you keep holding on to me,

37
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
You’ll be the one getting hurt.

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Now that you know the whole truth,

39
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,720
It’s time, isn’t it?

40
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,920
Time for you to face the truth.

41
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,800
Let me go, please.

42
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Stop trying to do anything

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,120
That would make me come back to you again.

44
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
You've done enough already.

45
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,520
That's enough.

46
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
You really love her that much, don’t you?

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
I love Pleng so much.

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
I’ve always loved her.

50
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,600
And I’ll love her forever.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,920
Fine.

52
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,120
I’ll let you go, Wan.

53
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,800
But I’ll do

54
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
What I told you I would, Wan.

55
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,840
Ek, don’t!

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,080
Dad.

57
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,320
Dad.

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Dad.

59
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,520
Pleng!

60
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Why did you do this?

61
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,200
Pleng!

62
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,400
Pleng, call an ambulance.

63
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,000
I need to stop the bleeding.

64
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,520
Pleng,

65
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,320
Get a grip.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Dad.

67
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Dad.

68
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,200
Pleng!

69
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,720
-Dad!
-Pleng, listen to me!

70
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,720
This is Ek, not your dad.

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,080
If you don’t act fast,

72
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,600
Ek might not make it, just like your dad didn’t.

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
Get a grip and call the ambulance.

74
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,000
(Emergency Room -Accident)

75
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,280
What’s going on with this case, Wan?

76
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,720
Male patient, 30 years old.

77
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,480
Attempted suicide by firearm.

78
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,800
Gunshot wound to the back right of the head.

79
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,000
BP is 85/60,

80
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,200
HR 120, oxygen saturation 94%.

81
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,840
We’ve started two IV lines.

82
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Currently loading Ringer's lactate.

83
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,000
Take care of him.

84
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,320
Please wait outside.

85
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,720
Sir, please,

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,320
Nurse, please take him for a CT scan and X-ray.

87
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
The patient is stable now.

88
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,320
We’ll just have to wait for the CT and X-ray results.

89
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you.

90
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,800
I shouldn’t have come back into your life.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Don’t say that.

92
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,800
I mean it, Wan.

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
If I wasn’t here today,

94
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
Ek wouldn’t have hurt himself.

95
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
That’s not true.

96
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Even if you weren’t here,

97
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
Ek would still have done it.

98
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
The problem isn’t you.

99
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,400
It’s that…

100
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,720
I don’t love Ek.

101
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,400
And Ek couldn’t accept that truth.

102
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,320
If he could’ve accepted it,

103
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,200
None of this would’ve happened.

104
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,920
Don’t blame yourself, okay?

105
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,400
If you look at it in a good way…

106
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,320
What happened…

107
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,000
It might just be a test.

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,800
To see if we can hold on tight enough

109
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,120
To get through everything together.

110
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,720
But this test…

111
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,720
It’s too much.

112
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,200
Don’t talk like you’re giving up, Pleng.

113
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
We’ll get through this together.

114
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,920
And nothing will be harder than this, I promise.

115
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,520
Trust me.

116
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,000
Ek is out of danger now.

117
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
You evil thing, what did you do to my son?

118
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
Wan didn’t do anything!

119
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,000
-Ek hurt himself.
-That’s not true!

120
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
My son is not weak.

121
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,520
If there wasn’t someone causing this,

122
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,800
He would never do something so stupid.

123
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,800
Why are you smiling? I asked, why are you smiling?

124
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,200
I’m happy for Ek.

125
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
Since I’ve known him,

126
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
This is the first time

127
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,560
That you both,

128
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,280
Have stood up to protect Ek.

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
Especially you, Dad.

130
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,000
If Ek wasn’t on the brink of death,

131
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
He’d never have seen it.

132
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
How much you actually care about him.

133
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,600
What are you saying?

134
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,240
-You want to keep talking?
-That’s enough.

135
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,520
That’s enough.

136
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,320
Even if you blame Wan,

137
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,320
She’s the one who saved Ek’s life.

138
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
If it weren’t for her,

139
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,800
Ek wouldn’t have survived.

140
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,520
Who are you to meddle in our affairs?

141
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,200
Tell me, what did you do to my son?

142
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,120
-Dr. Wan, Dr. Wan!
-What did you do?

143
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,280
Can we get a quick interview, Dr. Wan?

144
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,600
You were both there when Ek shot himself, right?

145
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Yes.

146
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,000
Did Ek harm himself because he saw the two of you together?

147
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
What exactly is your relationship?

148
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,600
-Yes, what’s your relationship?
-What’s going on between you two?

149
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,000
-Please answer!
-Sorry, excuse us.

150
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,920
That’s all for today.

151
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,200
Dr. Wan is really exhausted.

152
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,280
And everyone is still in shock from what just happened.

153
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,320
I agree.

154
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,800
Right now, the most important thing is

155
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
To wait for my son to wake up.

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Just stay calm for now.

157
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,280
We’ll take our leave now.

158
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,720
-Wait a moment!
-Everyone from the press,

159
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,000
If there’s any update,

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
I’ll hold another press conference.

161
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
We’re lucky.

162
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,320
My doctor friend bought this place but never moved in,

163
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,200
So we can stay here for now.

164
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Eat something,

165
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Or you’ll have no energy.

166
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,120
I’m not hungry yet.

167
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
You go ahead and eat.

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
You’ve got work to do.

169
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,120
I’m not doing anything today.

170
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,320
Why?

171
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,600
Aren’t you playing music at the hotel?

172
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,320
I don’t really know what to do.

173
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,200
Just eat something, please.

174
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,520
I’ll even feed you myself.

175
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,320
Get plenty of rest, okay?

176
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
When you wake up, you won’t have to think about anything.

177
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,720
All the bad things are behind us now.

178
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
I’m off to work now.

179
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
Who’s here?

180
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,120
Open the door now!

181
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
I know you’re in there.

182
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,800
How did you know I was here, Mom?

183
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,520
Someone told me, that’s all.

184
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
And why is Pleng still with you?

185
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,600
Why wouldn’t she be?

186
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,520
We’re together,

187
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,000
We’re a couple.

188
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,000
Aunt Wi!

189
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Don’t ever say something like that again.

190
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,400
Your husband is lying in a coma at the hospital right now.

191
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,640
Have some decency.

192
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,960
-It’s not like that, Aunt Wi.
-It's okay.

193
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Things have come this far already.

194
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,400
If you still can’t accept the truth,

195
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,520
That’s your problem,

196
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
Not ours.

197
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
The truth, huh?

198
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,320
Do you want to know what the truth really is?

199
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,600
And who exactly can’t accept it?

200
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,640
What are you about to say, Mom?

201
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
The truth.

202
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,440
The truth is, you two are siblings.
You have the same father.

203
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,520
Mom!

204
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,640
Do you even realize what you’re saying?

205
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
What do you mean, Aunt Wi?

206
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,640
Pleng, do you remember what Madam once told you?

207
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
There was a time when she was very ill.

208
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,400
She had to stay in the hospital for several days.

209
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,520
I was stressed about work.

210
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,640
I needed to find a way to let it all out.

211
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
Who was I supposed to turn to?

212
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,520
Kwan was also sick in the hospital.

213
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,120
Please sit here, sir.

214
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,840
And not long after that,

215
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,920
I got pregnant with Wan.

216
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
Mom!

217
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,120
And I realized

218
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,640
That Wan is the man's daughter.

219
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,920
Stop lying, Mom!

220
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
I’m not lying.

221
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,599
If I’m really his daughter,

222
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,920
Then what about Dad?

223
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,319
He thought you were his, of course.

224
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,319
But the one who knows the truth is me,

225
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,920
Because I’m your mother.

226
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,599
Then why did you keep this secret, Aunt Wi?

227
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,440
Why didn’t you tell Dad?

228
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
I did tell him.

229
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,119
And we made an agreement.

230
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,400
That Madam would never find out about this.

231
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
And the man promised to take the best care of Wan.

232
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,320
You’ve seen it yourself, Pleng.

233
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,440
He really did as he said he would.

234
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,920
No boss would ever take such good care

235
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,840
Of a maid’s child unless that child was his heir.

236
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,920
If that wasn’t his own blood.

237
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
Stop it, Mom.

238
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,640
Stop making up lies.

239
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
It’s not true.

240
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,320
I’m not lying.

241
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,840
I just want you both to understand, no matter how much you love each other,

242
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,040
Your love can never be.

243
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,320
Because you two are siblings.

244
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
It’s not true.

245
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,600
It’s not true.

246
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,040
It’s not true.

247
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
Aunt Wi,

248
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,040
It’s not true, right? It’s not true.

249
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,960
Pleng, it’s not true.

250
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,240
Pleng, listen to me. Pleng!

251
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,520
Pleng!

252
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,040
It’s not true, Aunt Wi is lying!

253
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,400
Pleng, listen to me first.

254
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,120
-Pleng, listen to me first!
-Aunt Wi is lying!

255
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
Pleng, listen to me.

256
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,000
What my mom said isn’t true, no matter what.

257
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,440
Pleng.

258
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,920
Pleng, calm down and listen to me.

259
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,520
-I want to be alone.
-Pleng.

260
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,640
Pleng.

261
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,040
Get out, now!

262
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,000
I want to be alone.

263
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,000
How are you doing?

264
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,040
Is there anything I can do to help?

265
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Just tell me.

266
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,640
Do you have somewhere I can stay?

267
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,920
What happened?

268
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,520
Well...

269
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,840
Something happened…

270
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,280
That makes it impossible for me to stay with Wan right now.

271
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,320
Please, help me.

272
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,320
OK.

273
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,520
I have two condos next to each other.

274
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,040
I’m only using one right now.

275
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,200
The other one, I was planning to turn into a recording studio,

276
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,440
But I haven’t started yet.

277
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,720
You can stay there for now.

278
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,040
Thank you.

279
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,240
Who were you talking to?

280
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,240
Wan.

281
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,240
I don’t think Aunt Wi was lying.

282
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,520
Who would lie about something like that
and make it sound so real and reasonable, Wan?

283
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,520
I know my mom well.

284
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,240
I don’t believe what she said.

285
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,120
But what if what your mom said is true?

286
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,840
Then what?

287
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,720
Suppose it’s true.

288
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,920
What are you going to do?

289
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,520
Are you going to leave me again?

290
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,040
Pleng, we’ve been through so much together.

291
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,920
I understand, Wan.

292
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,040
But I really can’t get past this.

293
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,720
Just thinking about it…

294
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,000
Makes it even harder…

295
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,120
To look at you anymore.

296
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,240
Please, let me go.

297
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,240
And where will you go?

298
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,320
Do you even have somewhere to stay?

299
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,240
Earth…

300
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,440
He said he has a spare room.

301
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
Another place.

302
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,040
Then you don’t need to leave.

303
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,720
I’ll go instead.

304
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,120
I’m sorry.

305
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,320
I’m sorry for making you like this.

306
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,920
I kept thinking that…

307
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,840
If I did this,

308
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,720
Everyone would be happy.

309
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,720
And I’d be happy too.

310
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,120
Pleng would be happy.

311
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,840
And one day, you’d be happy too.

312
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,800
But in reality, it wasn’t like that.

313
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,840
Now everyone’s hurting.

314
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,720
I’m not going to ask you to forgive me.

315
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,840
But if you wake up,

316
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
I want you to forget everything, Ek.

317
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,040
Let’s start a new life, one that’s happy.

318
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,520
I believe that,

319
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,920
There will be someone out there who truly loves you.

320
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,720
And even if you haven’t found that person yet,

321
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,000
You still have your family,

322
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,640
Who loves you, Ek.

323
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,800
A family that…

324
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,640
You thought never supported you.

325
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,600
But that’s not true.

326
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,440
They love you so much,

327
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,320
And they’re always ready to stand by your side.

328
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,600
Unlike me right now,

329
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,040
Who has no one left.

330
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,320
I’ll go now.

331
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,040
Thank you for the love you’ve given me all this time, Ek.

332
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,120
I’ll never forget it.

333
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,320
Wan! It’s perfect timing.
You got an urgent document.

334
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,640
From the DNA lab.

335
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,320
By the way, whose test results are those?

336
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,080
Please return this keycard to Wan for me.

337
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,360
Sure.

338
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,480
Wait a moment.

339
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,480
Wan left this for you.

340
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,480
Thank you.

341
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,560
Pleng,

342
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,160
I guess now it’s finally my chance

343
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
To write you a letter.

344
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,760
After 13 years ago,

345
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,280
When you left me a letter

346
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,240
And ran away.

347
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,880
Leaving me to live as if I were dead inside.

348
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,440
And even though we were given a second chance to meet,

349
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,160
You’re still thinking of leaving me again.

350
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
Do you know

351
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,360
How exhausted I am?

352
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,360
While I kept trying to hold on,

353
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,760
You kept running away.

354
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,440
So I thought,

355
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,080
Writing you this letter

356
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,160
Would be the last thing I could do.

357
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,960
Even though I hate this way of communicating so much.

358
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,160
I admit, when Mom said we were siblings,

359
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,880
I was just as shocked as you.

360
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
But what’s different between us,

361
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,560
Is that I don’t believe it.

362
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,280
Not even for a second.

363
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,280
While you believed it right away, completely and without question.

364
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,080
You didn’t even try to fight to find the truth.

365
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,760
All you thought about was running away again.

366
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,880
So I decided

367
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,440
That I had to do something.

368
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,880
To prove the truth to you.

369
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,440
And the DNA test results show

370
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,480
That we’re not actually siblings.

371
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
You’re probably wondering

372
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Why I didn’t show you the results right away when they came out.

373
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,800
So we could finally understand each other

374
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,680
And not have to be separated anymore.

375
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,560
But then I thought…

376
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,240
Love shouldn’t depend on just one piece of paper.

377
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,560
It should depend on

378
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,880
How much we trust each other.

379
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,160
And if that trust is strong enough,

380
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,680
Even without test results,

381
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,360
Even if the truth hasn’t been proven,

382
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,360
We’d still love each other,

383
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,680
And we wouldn’t let go of each other.

384
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,760
But that’s not what happened.

385
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,160
You were ready to let me go again,

386
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,080
Leaving me to suffer once more,

387
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
Just like the past 13 years.

388
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,760
Dr. Wan?

389
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,560
Dr. Wan?

390
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,480
Don’t come looking for me.

391
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,880
I don’t want you to suffer like I did.

392
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,680
Maybe,

393
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Us being apart

394
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,880
Is just another test.

395
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,480
To see if

396
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,360
We were truly meant for each other.

397
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,080
If we are,

398
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
We’ll find our way back to each other.

399
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,560
But if not,

400
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,960
I’ll keep you in my memories,

401
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,360
And you’ll always be the one I love.

402
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,280
And I’ll love you forever.

403
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,680
Wan.

404
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,080
Wan.

405
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,880
Wan.

406
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,960
Where are you, Wan?

407
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,080
Wan.

408
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,880
Wan.

409
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,080
Stop, Pleng.

410
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
Aunt Wi.

411
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,360
Wan’s not here.

412
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,160
She’s run away, Aunt Wi.

413
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,680
Run away?

414
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Yes.

415
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,240
I’ve searched everywhere,

416
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
But I couldn’t find her.

417
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,360
Do you know where Wan might be?

418
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,640
Then you don’t need to look for her.

419
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,360
Because someone like Wan,

420
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,840
Isn’t the type to run from problems.

421
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,560
If she’s decided to run, it means she doesn’t want anyone to follow her.

422
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,760
It's a waste of time.

423
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,680
Don’t you care about Wan at all, Aunt Wi?

424
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,880
When Wan was with you, it was more concerning.

425
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,160
Because you made her blind to the truth,

426
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,360
Stuck in a fantasy world where it was just the two of you.

427
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,160
If that’s how you want to think, fine.

428
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,560
But take a look at this document, Aunt Wi.

429
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,280
Then you’ll see

430
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,360
Who’s really living in a fantasy.

431
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,280
No.

432
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,160
What is it?

433
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,160
It’s the DNA test results for Pleng and Wan.

434
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,680
And the results show

435
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,680
That Pleng and Wan

436
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,680
Are not siblings.

437
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,760
That’s not true.

438
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
I don’t believe it.

439
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,560
Wan is Wut’s daughter.

440
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,640
I’m her mother, I know best.

441
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,480
You don’t need to show me any documents or test results.

442
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,440
It’s come this far, Aunt Wi.

443
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,440
Scientific results

444
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
Can’t lie, Aunt Wi.

445
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,160
I don’t believe it.

446
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,960
I won’t believe it, no matter what.

447
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,640
-It’s not true!
-Aunt Wi.

448
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,160
Please listen to me.

449
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,360
Wan is Wut’s daughter.

450
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,320
There’s no other explanation, I’m certain of it.

451
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,200
Aunt Wi, calm down.

452
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,840
-I don’t believe you!
-Aunt Wi!

453
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,560
It’s not true!

454
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,360
I don’t believe you.

455
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,680
I told you, I don’t believe you!

456
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,880
Get out!

457
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,960
Hello? Hello?

458
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,040
What happened, boss?

459
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,240
This guest has acted inappropriately.

460
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,080
Escort them out immediately.

461
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,160
Yes, boss.

462
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,240
Wan!

463
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,440
Wan!

464
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,440
Wan!

465
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,440
Frank?

466
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,240
Which room is this lady staying in? I’ll take her myself.

467
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,560
Let me check for you.

468
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,040
Let’s go, Wan.

469
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,760
Walk carefully, be cautious.

470
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,560
Watch your step, be careful.

471
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,240
Slowly, Wan, slowly.

472
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,240
This way, come on.

473
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,520
Wan!

474
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,080
Wan!

475
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,840
Wan!

476
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,560
Calm down, Wan.

477
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,040
Wan!

478
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,120
Why did Pleng do this to me?

479
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,640
Did Wan and Pleng get back together?

480
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,960
Oh, you…

481
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,760
Weren’t you going to move in with me?

482
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,360
What happened to you?

483
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Are you okay?

484
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,440
Calm down.

485
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,120
Maybe you should rest for a bit.

486
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,040
They do busking here, you know.

487
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,560
Want to join in?

488
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,840
You can play the song you wrote for your girlfriend.

489
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,440
It might help with the stress.

490
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,560
I can’t play right now.

491
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,640
Why not?

492
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,320
Because the one I wrote it for

493
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,760
Has left me.

494
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,040
I won’t play that song again

495
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,840
Unless they come back.

496
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,360
Wan, right?

497
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
You knew?

498
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,160
Oh, come on.

499
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,440
Things have gone this far.

500
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,440
I don’t know, it’s strange.

501
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,640
How about this?

502
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,240
If she comes back to you,

503
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,960
Let her go,

504
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,360
And start something with me.

505
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,360
I still stand by

506
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,880
what I said before,
That I like you.

507
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
Thank you for liking me.

508
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,640
In this life...

509
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,240
I don’t think I can love anyone else but Wan.

510
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,120
Then here’s what I suggest:

511
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,160
Go find Wan and sort things out.
Then you can get back to playing the songs you love.

512
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,160
I’ve tried.

513
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,240
I went to every place I thought Wan would go.

514
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,760
But I couldn’t find her anywhere.

515
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,640
Have you tried going to the place

516
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,120
Where you shared something special?

517
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,960
Thank you so much.

518
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,760
You know, don’t you…

519
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
Where that is?

520
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:00,960
Wan.

521
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
Do you want to go anywhere today? I’ll take you.

522
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,760
I want to go to a tattoo shop.

523
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,240
Hello.

524
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,720
-Do you have a design ready?
-Yes, I do.

525
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,360
Where would you like the tattoo?

526
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,040
-On this side, please.
-Okay.

527
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,640
-Shall we start now?
-Sure.

528
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,240
I’ll prepare the tools for you.

529
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,640
Why did you choose this design?

530
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,240
It has a meaning related to Pleng.

531
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,640
But you told me

532
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,760
That you and Pleng aren’t really siblings like you thought.

533
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,360
So why this design?

534
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,360
Gemini symbolizes siblings, doesn’t it?

535
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,160
Yes, that’s true.

536
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,160
But I think

537
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,560
It can mean whatever we want it to.

538
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,320
It’s up to how we see it.

539
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,960
My love with Pleng,

540
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,120
We’re both friends,

541
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,760
Siblings,

542
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,440
And lovers too.

543
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,040
We are everything

544
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,160
To each other.

545
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
Why are you smiling, Frank?

546
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,640
Well, at first,

547
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,840
I was planning to tell you something

548
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,640
After you finished your tattoo.

549
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,320
But now,

550
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,960
I think it’s better if I don’t.

551
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,040
What were you planning to tell me, Frank?

552
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,160
I was going to say…

553
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,640
If you and Pleng don’t end up together this time,

554
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,640
I’d like you to…

555
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Give me a chance to take care of you.

556
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,160
Because you don’t have anyone, and I don’t either.

557
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,760
Like I’ve told you before,

558
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,920
We’re better off

559
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,040
Being like siblings.

560
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
I believe

561
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,840
I won’t be able to love anyone else in this life,

562
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,240
Other than Pleng.

563
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,960
This way, please, customer.

564
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,640
Excuse me,

565
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,160
The woman in this photo,

566
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,840
Which room is she staying in?

567
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,240
That’s private information, we can’t disclose it.
Is there something wrong?

568
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,360
Frank!

569
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,360
Yes, it’s me.

570
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,040
How did you end up here?

571
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,160
Well, I own this place.

572
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,440
Then you must know where Wan is.

573
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,360
Didn’t the staff already tell you? It’s confidential.

574
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,520
Please, Frank.

575
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,840
Tell me, please.

576
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,520
I really need to see Wan.

577
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,240
And how can I be sure

578
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,240
That you won’t hurt her again?

579
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,760
Wan’s already been hurt by you too much.

580
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,240
I don’t want to see her suffer again, I care about her.

581
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,760
Frank, I know.

582
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,720
Just give me one more chance.

583
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,640
One last time.

584
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,320
I swear on my life.

585
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,560
Just let me see Wan.

586
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,440
I promise I won’t hurt her again.

587
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,240
Please.

588
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,720
Do whatever you want, it’s your business.

589
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,440
You don’t need to ask for anything from me.

590
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,640
Aunt Wi.

591
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,240
I understand now.

592
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,440
Why you don’t like me.

593
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,120
-You.
-Thank you.

594
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,000
You’ve been married to a man before,

595
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,720
And I didn’t feel anything about it.

596
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,400
Is that how it is?

597
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,240
Yes, and what of it?

598
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,440
I’m going to Bangkok today.

599
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,520
Want to meet up?

600
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,920
(Sneaky kiss.)

601
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,600
Try getting closer.

602
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,920
(Kisses nonstop.)

603
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,720
You’re cross-eyed.

604
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,920
Not at all!

605
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,240
(Into the moment.)

606
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,920
(Going all in together.)

607
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,000
Cut!

608
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,640
Let’s reset.

609
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,840
(Supporting each other.)

610
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,440
It’s alright, no worries.

611
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,720
Go get some water.

612
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,600
(No matter how many takes, keep fighting.)

613
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,040
(We’ll keep going!)
