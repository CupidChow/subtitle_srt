1
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,370
Lion dance,

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,120
is the unique and charming folk culture of the Chinese people..

3
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,250
Originated from ancient martial arts training.

4
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,870
Martial artists use martial arts techniques and body movements,

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,250
simulate lion movements.

6
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,870
Over time,

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Lion dance gradually developed into an independent art form.,

8
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,120
but still deeply preserve martial arts traditions.

9
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,000
Strong, sturdy,

10
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,370
incredible aura.

11
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:10,870
So,

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
there is a martial arts school inviting lion dance,

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,830
we must seize the opportunity,

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,250
debuted at Shanghai port once.

15
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,370
But I work all day.

16
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,000
What about switching to the night shift?

17
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,370
Yes, yes!

18
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,000
I come to challenge!

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,370
"The Night of Fighting" tournament, check it out.

20
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,000
Discount, check it out!

21
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,120
Check it out, it's on sale!

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,370
Hurry up, hurry up!

23
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,620
Muay Thai is coming!

24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
What do you think we should do?

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,620
I've been waiting at this intersection for an hour.

26
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,620
Not moving at all!

27
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,120
Didn't I tell you?

28
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,250
Thanh Hoang Temple is definitely jammed with traffic now!

29
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,750
What were you doing before?

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,000
Change people!

31
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,870
Where can I find people now?

32
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,250
Need help?

33
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,120
Move, move!

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,290
Let me say it again,

35
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,500
not real,

36
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,870
but it's not a fake either.

37
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,500
Coordinate well.

38
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,370
Give way, give way!

39
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,120
Give up!

40
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,370
Your turn!

41
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,750
Come on, come on!

42
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
Muay Thai, Muay Thai!

43
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Are you blind?

44
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,710
Can't you dodge a little?

45
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,120
Isn't that a fake?

46
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,870
Why so heavy handed?

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,870
Then sorry!

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Little brother!

49
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,500
A Quyen!

50
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,120
That fall just now was so expressive!

51
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,370
You really fell, you devil!

52
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,000
You really fell, you devil!

53
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,370
Thanks, thanks!

54
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,500
Come here, come here!

55
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,620
Quick view, quick view!

56
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,000
We are a long-standing brand!

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,120
Enter the store and get a 100 VND cash coupon!

58
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,120
Wait!

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,250
Isn't this Master Truong of Cau Chan martial arts school?

60
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,120
I didn't hit very hard just now.

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,250
Who cares about fake play? Play for real!

62
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,870
Who is that?

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,870
He doesn't know either?

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,620
That boxer is very famous!

65
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,120
Previously, the signs of the old martial arts schools,

66
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,750
was all snatched down by him!

67
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,790
Kim Ham Martial Arts School, Tieu Truong Duong!

68
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,500
Come here specifically to "seek the truth" at Cau Chan martial arts school

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,710
What's wrong?

70
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,120
Martial arts master!

71
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,120
Is to look down on me, Tieu,

72
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,370
or don't dare to fight?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,120
Not wearing sunglasses,

74
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,500
so can't see clearly?

75
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,000
Get off first!

76
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,000
It's real, it's real!

77
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,250
It's real!

78
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,000
I invited you here to perform,

79
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,500
not here to be laughed at!

80
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,500
You see how crowded the scene is today,

81
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,870
performance is also quite good.

82
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,370
Unexpectedly three years have passed,

83
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,250
still no progress.

84
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,620
Just play it yourself,

85
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,000
still trying to go out and make a joke.

86
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,870
Are you dead?

87
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,620
Traditional martial arts are no longer useful.

88
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,250
You see that?
That's right.

89
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,370
I'll let you off this time.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,370
Still dare to cheat,

91
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,370
I beat him every time I see him!

92
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,120
The human world,

93
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,370
the sky is sad.

94
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,670
Be gentle, it hurts!

95
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,000
Hang on!

96
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
Look!

97
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,000
I said this type of operation is not accepted.

98
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,500
A whole decent martial arts school,

99
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,370
what advertising activity do you accept!

100
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,870
It has nothing to do with it!

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,620
Now let's not talk about promotional activities,

102
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,870
even if it's a funeral, wedding, or running errands, I still have to do it!

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You just go home and read your book!

104
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,620
Stop doing stupid things!

105
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,120
What nonsense!

106
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,120
The martial arts school is my father's lifelong passion!

107
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,000
It's so hard now,

108
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,460
how can I not worry?

109
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,120
Just rely on you?

110
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,500
How to pay debt?

111
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,620
I tell you,

112
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,250
I am now expanding my business,

113
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,120
one month starts,

114
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,370
half year payback period.

115
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,250
Come pay in a year.

116
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,500
No problem!

117
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,120
One year is not enough.
One year is not enough.

118
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,000
Go play this tournament,

119
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,500
maybe there is still hope.

120
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,500
If I play well,

121
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,000
what about the scale you said?

122
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,750
If it's ok.

123
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,120
Let's go.

124
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,370
She...

125
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,870
Want some pay?

126
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,000
You all can see the situation today.

127
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,250
We didn't get the money either.

128
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,750
I leave you my phone number and address,

129
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,500
come get it in a few days.

130
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,620
Don't worry.

131
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,750
Not a single cent is missing from you.

132
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,250
I am Vuong Trieu Vu.

133
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,620
If you are not sure, I will give you my ID to take a picture.

134
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,870
No need, no need.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,870
I didn't mean that.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,620
It's okay to have that idea.

137
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,750
Whatever it is.

138
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,250
A Quyen!

139
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,620
Can that money still be claimed back?

140
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,000
What the hell!

141
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,620
You're a good person all day long and useless.

142
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,750
No wonder it took so long,

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
not a penny earned!

144
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,370
Having the chance to dance the lion is great!

145
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,620
I've been here for over a year,

146
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,750
never seen a lion dance!

147
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,000
What you said makes sense.

148
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,000
If Shanghai normally did not have lion dances,

149
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,250
so doesn't that mean,

150
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,000
should we try another place?

151
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,120
Change your head!

152
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,000
This shows that the lion dance market in Shanghai is a void!

153
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,620
With our strength,

154
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,040
can definitely open up the situation!

155
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,620
Open the window and it's Hangzhou Bay!

156
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,500
The rarest ocean view apartment in all of Shanghai!

157
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,370
By then the money you earn will definitely be more real than Bach To Trinh!

158
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,370
Remembering the old days,

159
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,750
Bai Su Zhen and Xiao Ma Ge at the Shanghai docks seized the opportunity,

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,250
made a career from scratch, passed down as a legend.

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,870
Probably Phung Trinh Trinh and Hua Van Cuong, right?

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,370
So finding Bach To Trinh can stimulate Hua Van Cuong's potential!

163
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Find a stable job first!

164
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,620
Let me tell you,

165
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,870
I checked the imperial calendar when I went out.

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,330
We will definitely have smooth sailing here and accomplish great things!

167
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,620
It's not as good as you think.
THE YOUNG HERO PART 2 Translated by: Tieu Dong

168
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,750
Big city has many opportunities.

169
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,370
Yeah, don't worry.

170
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,120
One.

171
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,370
I know, I know.

172
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,620
Enough clothes.

173
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,370
Sorry.

174
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,120
Yeah.

175
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,250
Cooking rice?

176
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,500
A Mieu, A Cau are here.

177
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,120
We have one more thing to do today.

178
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm feeling a little better today.
There are tomatoes stir-fried with beef.

179
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,620
There is also chicken stewed with shiitake mushrooms.

180
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,370
Yeah.

181
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,000
A Quyen just came back?

182
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,750
Have to go to work now.
Mr. Chu, you go first.

183
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm almost done.
Where is Dad?

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,370
Listening next to it.

185
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,750
Dad, I got a number to see a specialist.

186
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll go ask around in a few days.

187
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,500
Dad can definitely stand up.

188
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,250
Okay, okay.

189
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,620
No need to rush.

190
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,000
Take care of your work first.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't worry, mom.

192
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,870
Hang up now.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,120
Okay.

194
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,620
Is this book still available?

195
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,500
A Quyen.

196
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,370
You used to be really good at drawing.

197
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,370
I'm going to work now.

198
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
You guys should go to bed early.

199
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,370
I drew this picture.

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
Doctor.

201
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,620
Is my father still able to walk?

202
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,120
Regular rehabilitation.

203
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,620
How much recovery depends on the individual.

204
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,120
So how long does it take to cure?

205
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,870
About a year.

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The earlier treatment is effective, the better.

207
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,120
A year?

208
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,370
So how much does it cost?

209
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,250
If you go with health insurance,

210
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,120
doesn't cost much.

211
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,250
So what if there is no health insurance?

212
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,120
My dad still doesn't have insurance.

213
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,250
If self-pay,

214
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,120
estimated to be more than one hundred thousand.

215
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,370
Who are you guys?

216
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,620
We are here.

217
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,620
Are you guys from this area?

218
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,120
Who told you?

219
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,620
This won't work!

220
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,620
A Quyen!

221
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,370
What do you think about these two people?

222
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,870
I don't see it being a day or two!

223
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,750
Aunt Hoang!

224
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,620
They just arrived in Shanghai and haven't found a job yet.

225
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,870
Stay at my house for a few days.

226
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,120
How many days?

227
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,620
So how many days do you say?

228
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,500
It was clearly stated when signing the contract!

229
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,870
The policy stipulates,

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,500
five square meters for one person only!

231
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,500
A Quyen!

232
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,120
Don't make it difficult for Aunt Hoang, okay?

233
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,500
Sorry, Aunt Hoang.

234
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,870
So what do you think we should do?

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,120
Change to a bigger room.

236
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,250
Pay another 1500 VND tomorrow morning.

237
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,120
So much!

238
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,000
The contract clearly states deposit one and pay three!

239
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,870
If not, then don't stay.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't stay, don't stay!

241
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,870
Our money is not enough.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,870
No problem.

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,250
I get paid tonight.

244
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,500
Get paid?

245
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,120
So who is responsible for the steel reinforcement cost?

246
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,500
Calculate in my head?

247
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,250
How many times have I told you!

248
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,620
Materials at the construction site are all assets!

249
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,120
All can be sold for money!

250
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,000
Be careful, be more careful!

251
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,500
Where did all the listeners go?

252
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,250
You can't frame good people!

253
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,750
When I was on guard, I didn't even blink an eyelid!

254
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,620
I don't care whose fault it is!

255
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,620
From today onwards,

256
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,370
you two don't need to come to work anymore!

257
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,870
Go, go, go!

258
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
But I've been doing this for so long!

259
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,870
If it's still complicated, you'll have to pay for the steel reinforcement!

260
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,750
Ah Cat!

261
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,620
What year did you go out to see the imperial calendar?

262
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,250
You guys keep looking for jobs.

263
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,710
I'll go get the lion dance money first.

264
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
Otherwise I'll have to sleep under the bridge tonight.

265
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Look, look, look!

266
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,500
Don't miss it when you pass by!

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Little brother!

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,250
Want to learn a little about boxing?

269
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,370
Want to learn a little about boxing?

270
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,370
Excuse me, which way is the way to Cau Chan martial arts school?

271
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,870
I don't know, I don't know!

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,620
Our place is the best!

273
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,750
What a bridge!

274
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,120
Get out!

275
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,370
Step on a banana peel at her door.

276
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,370
It turns out like this.

277
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
- You have to take responsibility! - Ouch, it hurts, it hurts!

278
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,870
How to calculate this?

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,750
We,

280
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,000
does not mean anything else.

281
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,750
Just asking for some money for medicine, money for effort,

282
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,120
there is also something called compensation for mental damage.

283
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,870
Don't even dream!

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Get lost!

285
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,620
No right?

286
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,500
Then we won't go either!

287
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,370
Get out!

288
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
You did it first!

289
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,000
Come back, come back!
Fast, fast, fast!

290
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,370
If you don't get out, I'll call the police!

291
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,370
Report!

292
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,870
You think I'm scared!

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,250
110 please listen!

294
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,120
Hello!

295
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,750
Someone is causing trouble here!

296
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,120
Please provide address.

297
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,750
Send the police immediately!

298
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
Big brother, someone called the police!

299
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,000
You stinking brat!

300
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,370
Do something?

301
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,370
Stop hitting!

302
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,370
Stop hitting!

303
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,750
Don't do it!

304
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,370
Don't attack, don't hit anymore!

305
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,000
Get out of the way!

306
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,620
Are you nosy?

307
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,000
Call the police, right?

308
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,370
Here's a report for you!

309
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,620
For...

310
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,750
Dare to fight back?

311
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,250
Stop hitting!

312
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,500
Why so fierce?

313
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,500
I remember your face!

314
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,500
You just wait!

315
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Thanks!

316
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,370
You,

317
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,000
is it ok?

318
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,250
No problem.

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,370
Thanks for your help.

320
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
I didn't expect you to play so well.

321
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,500
To dance the lion, you have to learn martial arts.

322
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,250
Who are they?

323
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,870
The martial arts school next door.

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,120
Every two or three days they come to cause trouble again.

325
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,870
Just happened to be caught by you.

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,870
Last time the trouble was also caused by their people.

327
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,620
They want to expand their territory.

328
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,250
Aiming at my house.

329
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,500
Find every way to force me to close the door.

330
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,870
I don't want it!

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,620
Are you here to get money?

332
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,500
I have some trouble,

333
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,120
need money.

334
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,750
Sorry, sorry.

335
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,370
Give it to me now.

336
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,750
Count it.

337
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Hey!

338
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,120
You are so good at martial arts,

339
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,120
want to try boxing?

340
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,500
Ring?

341
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,580
Here it is!

342
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,370
Stop joking.

343
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,370
I still have to find a job.

344
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,120
I can hire you.

345
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
All meals and accommodations included.

346
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,750
The competition also has prize money.

347
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,250
Bonus?

348
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,250
How much?

349
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,330
Top 4-100 thousand.

350
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,250
Champion 300 thousand.

351
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,000
I used to compete in lion dance,

352
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,620
but never fought in the ring,

353
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,620
I can find someone to teach you.

354
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you have it?

355
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,250
- Him? - Him?

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Last night I worked until 3:30 in the morning,

357
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,870
have to catch up on sleep.

358
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,620
Truong Watt!

359
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,000
Vuong Trieu Vu!

360
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,370
Give me a hand!

361
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,000
Consider a dead horse saving a living horse.

362
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,250
You have to find a horse too!

363
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,000
This kid can't even pretend!

364
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,000
Why play with it for real!

365
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,620
Isn't the photo just a fake?

366
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,500
That's true.

367
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,750
It's been a long time since I've seen him fight for real.

368
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,750
Who are you saying is faking it?

369
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,870
Say someone?

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,120
Me!

371
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,120
I'm here!

372
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,120
Try it!

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,580
Sorry!

374
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,500
Do you think boxing is the same as fighting?

375
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,750
Every move has a flaw!

376
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,250
Can't even last 3 seconds in the ring!

377
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,120
I know you can't swallow this anger!

378
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,250
But if we keep going like this, we'll only get beaten to the point of suffocation!

379
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,500
Well said!

380
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,120
Mr. Truong!

381
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,750
You have such rich experience in the ring,

382
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,120
should educate the young more!

383
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,750
What does it taste like to be beaten!

384
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,620
Why are you here again?

385
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,870
Tieu Truong Duong!

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,620
Don't go too far!

387
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,750
Young people do not understand things,

388
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,750
causes such a nuisance.

389
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,370
Must come and apologize.

390
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,370
What to do?

391
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,120
Let go!

392
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,250
King Dynasty!

393
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,120
There is mail.

394
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,370
From the court, sign it.

395
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,250
From the court, sign it.

396
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,000
Seal the house!

397
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:36,870
Oh!

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,250
Finally bankrupt!

399
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,620
Or,

400
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,000
sell this house to us directly!

401
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,500
Saves everyone some work!

402
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,870
Still made some money!

403
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,500
How good!

404
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't even dream!

405
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,620
Okay.

406
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,120
We wait.

407
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,120
Auction Court,

408
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,500
is even cheaper!

409
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,620
So arrogant!

410
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,620
Truong Watt!

411
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,620
I want to try again!

412
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,500
If that still doesn't work,

413
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,500
I will accept!

414
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,670
This contest is a reality TV show.

415
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,500
Many people see it as a great promotional opportunity.

416
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,120
If I could be famous,

417
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,000
is able to attract investment,

418
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,250
keep the house and the gym.

419
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,120
I pay you.

420
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,870
Watt Truong is responsible for teaching.

421
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,870
I don't need the bonus.

422
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,370
You divide by two eight.

423
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,620
Brother.

424
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,120
Eighth brother.

425
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,620
Any more bonuses?

426
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,120
Just getting into the qualifying round is already a blessing!

427
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,750
You said accommodation and meals are included, is that still included?

428
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,000
All meals are included.

429
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,370
Based on...

430
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,500
The martial arts school is about to be sealed.

431
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,750
Okay, okay.

432
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,370
I'll take care of your accommodation.

433
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,670
But my business cannot be delayed.

434
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,620
You have to work for me.

435
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,870
Three months left.

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
If you fail to qualify, disband.

437
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,620
So does your business still need people?

438
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,370
can boxing make money?

439
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,620
Win is good.

440
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,250
So what if you lose?

441
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,620
If you lose, consider it as working for someone else.

442
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,750
At least these three months no rent to pay.

443
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,120
Let's go.

444
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,000
She slept inside.

445
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,750
Coach!

446
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,870
Where do we practice?

447
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,620
This balcony.

448
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,120
That's not enough.

449
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,120
Look over there.

450
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,750
This place has been closed for a long time.

451
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,120
Formerly an old school.

452
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,620
That year the martial arts school was crowded,

453
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,620
my master,

454
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,120
is also Tieu Vu's father,

455
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,500
brought us here to practice.

456
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,000
She was young then,

457
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,620
probably don't remember.

458
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,120
I remember.

459
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,870
Yeah.

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,870
These are all the result of our practice.

461
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,620
So Tieu Vu's father, he...

462
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,290
Lost.

463
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,170
Dojo

464
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,120
is getting harder and harder.

465
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,370
Her father's lifelong passion,

466
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,000
are all put here.

467
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,000
Tieu Vu swallowed this anger for her father's sake.

468
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,250
If the master knew that she had dropped out of school and returned from abroad,

469
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,500
dropped out of school to take care of the martial arts school,

470
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,120
definitely disagree.

471
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,870
Just stay here.

472
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,420
Seeds can germinate anywhere.

473
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,580
I trust you guys.

474
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,120
It must be a new seed.

475
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,250
It's not too early anymore.

476
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,370
My business must be open now.

477
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,250
Mysterious.

478
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,120
What are you doing anyway?

479
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,870
Great event.

480
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,920
COMMON FOOD, FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE

481
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,500
Is that a big deal?

482
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,120
Don't just stand there!

483
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,750
People consider food as heaven.

484
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,370
Isn't the sky big enough?

485
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,750
Can't you see?

486
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,120
Hide and wait.

487
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,250
- So hard to eat! - So hard to eat!

488
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,120
Why is it so sweet?

489
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,370
Stop talking nonsense!

490
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,120
I clearly put salt!

491
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,120
Here is the salt line on the side!

492
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,870
Quick, quick!

493
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,370
What fast?

494
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,000
Hurry up and do the lion dance!

495
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,540
Hurry up and do the lion dance!

496
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,870
You must completely transform in these three months!

497
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,750
First,

498
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,120
physical strength and endurance must be trained well!

499
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,620
Run 10 kilometers every day!

500
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,120
Punch 2000 times!

501
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,330
Forget all other moves!

502
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,170
Practice straight punches, hook punches, and horizontal punches well!

503
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,000
Getting into the ring is even more tiring!

504
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,250
No help!

505
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,750
Then you have to take the beating!

506
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,620
Cannot be easily KO'd!

507
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,370
ME?

508
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,870
Knocked out and unable to get up, loser!

509
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,750
In short, if you want to learn to fight, you must first be beaten!

510
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,620
Hands up, hands up!

511
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,500
It is external training of tendons, bones and skin!

512
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,750
The more flexible the skin, the harder it is to KO!

513
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,500
Otherwise,

514
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,370
Hey!

515
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,370
Get in the ring and you'll be exposed!

516
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,120
Must practice well!

Hmm, delicious!

551
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,620
Martial arts originate from life.

552
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,750
There!

553
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,000
Everything can be practiced!

554
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,790
There!

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,870
can turn your three months into someone else's year!

Fight the ring,

559
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,370
win or lose in the blink of an eye!

560
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,750
Reaction rate,

561
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,500
must be fast enough.

562
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,750
Must practice constantly.

563
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,500
Practice muscle reflexes!

564
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,120
Boss!
Boss!

565
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,000
Two servings of salted fish fried rice to take home!

566
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,750
Boss, order!

567
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
Here we go, here we go, how about it?

568
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000

569
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,120

570
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,870

I'm taking a break.

605
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,120
Coach Truong!

606
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,250
A Quyen has been practicing these movements for two months.

607
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,500
You're not trying to trick him into doing hard work for you, are you?

608
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,620
Is there any new way to play?

609
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,080
Do you think that after three months of training you can really get into the ring?

610
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,000
I just want you not to lose too badly.

611
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,500
Martial arts fighting is just a few moves.

612
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,750
Unsteady foundation,

613
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,620
in a moment you will be KO'd!

614
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,750
If you don't want to end up like that, keep practicing!

615
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,870
You will thank me!

616
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,870
What's wrong?

617
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,870
Nothing.

618
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,620
The Great Night of Fighting, a large-scale talent search program is about to be held!

619
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,000
Hundreds of martial arts schools sent their best fighters to participate in this event!

620
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,250
Who can break through the siege and claim the championship title?

621
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,870
Who can represent the highest level of martial arts?

622
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,620
This martial arts event ignited the audience's enthusiasm!

623
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,750
In my opinion,

624
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,870
martial arts is the perfect combination of entertainment and sport,

625
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,750
has huge commercial potential.

626
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,620
This time we are not just holding a match,

627
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,370
but also want to take advantage of the power of the media,

628
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,250
makes a reality show about kungfu,

629
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,370
create public opinion hotspots, create martial arts stars!

630
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,120
Can both enrich the entertainment life of the public,

631
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,250
can also make the industry pie bigger!

632
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,920
Add some excitement

633
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,290
for this international city Shanghai!

634
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,210
He makes a lot of sense!

635
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,750
Idol, vision!

636
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,120
He wanted to make the cake bigger and eat it all himself!

637
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,250
Who is he?

638
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,870
The owner of the Kim Ham martial arts school.

639
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,500
Tieu Truong Duong is his man.

640
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,750
We, Kim Ham Martial Arts Club, are one of the sponsors,

641
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,620
will definitely spare no effort, try my best!

642
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,120
Okay, thank you Mr. Kim Moc Duong for accepting our interview!

643
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,870
Thanks!

644
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,370
Why are you here?

645
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,750
What about you?

646
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,500
I can't sleep.

647
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,120
Me too.

648
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,500
I can't take it anymore.

649
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,250
Take a break.

650
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,750
- You... - She...

651
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,000
You say first.

652
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,750
Never asked you,

653
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,370
why go to Shanghai?

654
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,870
Go to Shanghai to make money.

655
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,750
Everyone says so.

656
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,370
Tell your own story.

657
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,370
I'm fine.

658
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,370
Just wanted to check it out,

659
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
can you survive in the big city?

660
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,620
For a better life for the family.

661
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,120
Moreover,

662
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,370
my father's illness can only be cured in a big city.

663
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,370
I have been to Guangzhou for the past few years,

664
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,620
then to Shanghai.

665
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,750
Feel like big city has more opportunities.

666
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,370
More people.

667
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,750
I myself can't stand still,

668
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,370
let alone cure my father's illness.

669
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,750
Actually I should thank you.

670
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,500
For me, boxing is probably the fairest chance.

671
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,120
I am the one who should say thank you.

672
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,500
The competition is tomorrow.

673
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,370
Are you confident?

674
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
No.

675
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,370
That's why I can't sleep.

676
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Don't think too much.

677
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,870
There is no way to be discouraged now.

678
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
When I was little, my father used to say,

679
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,870
to practice martial arts or to be a human being, you must have a good tone.

680
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,620
Once you lose your spirit, you can't do anything.

681
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,120
External training of tendons, bones and skin,

682
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,000
practice a breath.

683
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,000
Hands up!

684
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,120
Take a breath!

685
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,500
Tighten your belt!

686
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,750
Tomorrow,

687
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,870
for my parents,

688
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,000
for everyone,

689
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,250
also for himself,

690
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,370
fight the air!

691
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,500
Dear audience!

692
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,250
Today we will be live streaming round one of the Cach Dau Chi Da tournament!

693
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,500
Qualifying round!

694
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,370
All registered fighters will be randomly divided into four groups,

695
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,870
one on one competition.

696
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,620
Finally keep half of the fighters,

697
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,250
enters the next round of scoring!

698
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,870
I am commentator Wei Xian!

699
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,040
Sitting to my left is martial arts expert Duong Due, Duong is the leader!

700
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,120
Hello everyone, I'm Duong Due!

701
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,920
Nice!

702
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,750
This tournament allows elbows and grappling!

703
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,330
Less restrictive.

704
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,250
The space for fighters to perform is also larger!

705
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,000
The game will be better!

706
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,250
Why are you wearing pajamas?

707
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,620
Who says wearing pajamas is not okay?

708
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,870
Where is your background music?

709
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,500
What background music?

710
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,870
Music when the boxer enters the ring!

711
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,750
Without music, the broadcast effect is not good.

712
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,120
We don't carry music!

713
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,870
It's too late, let us arrange it.

714
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,620
What style do you want?

715
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,620
We do traditional martial arts.

716
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,120
Give me a traditional song.

717
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,620
Got it!

718
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,000
The final match of Group A qualifiers is about to begin!

719
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,920
First out,

720
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,620
is a martial artist from Cau Chan martial arts school,

721
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:53,120
Lau Ka Quyen!

722
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,000
Go!

723
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,750
He is the youngest fighter,

724
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,370
among the fighters participating in this selection.

725
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,750
On the shoulder again shouldered the heaviest mission.

726
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,500
He will represent traditional martial arts to step into the ring!

727
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,120
Since ancient times heroes have emerged from youth!

728
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,210
Teeth!

729
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,870
It's been a long time since a traditional boxer appeared in the ring!

730
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,750
Can Lau Ka Kuen bring a different performance tonight?

731
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,750
Become a glorious winner?

732
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,870
Enter the field prostrate!

733
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,500
With sincerity!

734
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,870
Tieu Vu!

735
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
If it is eliminated,

736
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,250
you can't blame me!

737
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,620
Even without fighting, it increases one's morale!

738
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,250
A Quyen, keep it up!

739
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,870
Next up!

740
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,870
Terra Figo martial arts school representative!

741
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,370
From Brazil,

742
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,250
Silva!

743
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,620
Silva!

744
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,000
28 years old this year.
[Watch on www.kisskh.la to support Admin]

745
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,370
I used to practice Brazilian Capoeira,

746
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,120
Taekwondo.

747
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,250
Good with feet.

748
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,370
Diverse moves.

749
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,870
Incredibly powerful.

750
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,750
Nickname: Thoai Vuong!

751
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,370
Is a very individualistic fighter!

752
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,120
KO him!

753
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,870
One round!

754
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,250
Guide lines!

755
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,620
What did the boxer Silva mean by shouting just now?

756
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,370
He shouted "one round"!

757
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,210
Get ready to end the match in one round!

758
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,120
This Brazilian boxer is so arrogant!

759
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,000
No kicks to the groin, no hits to the back of the neck!

760
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,120
Do not attack a fallen fighter!

761
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,750
Keep the game clean!

762
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,870
If you have real power, you don't have to be arrogant.

763
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,870
is confident!
I said stop, so stop!

764
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,500
Understand?

765
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,290
His opponent is newcomer Lau Ka-Kuan!

766
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,620
Moreover I do not think,

767
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,000
what an amazing performance traditional martial arts can have on the ring!

768
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,330
End in the first half is very likely!

769
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,870
The two sides separate!

770
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,750
This situation,

771
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,120
lasting two minutes is very good!

772
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,250
Ready?

773
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Go!

774
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,620
This is the fastest knockdown so far in this tournament!

775
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,370
One hit KO! This is the standard of KO.

776
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,620
Get up!

777
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,120
Lau Ka Quyen stood up again!

778
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,750
With this difference in strength,

779
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,250
next knockdown, determine whether to continue the match?

780
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,620
Coming soon!

781
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,750
It definitely won't last the first half!

782
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,750
A Quyen, keep it up!

783
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,750
Go!

784
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,500
The instructions are indeed very accurate!

785
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,500
Hands up!

786
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,370
Come on A Quyen, you can do it!

787
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,870
Come on, come on!

788
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,620
This Lau Ka Kuen can take it again!

789
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,500
Just taking the hits is useless!

790
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,750
Can't last the first half!

791
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Go!

792
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,500
Hands up, hands up

793
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,500
How much time is left?

794
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,620
Keep it up!

795
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,870
A Quyen, keep it up!

796
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,870
15 seconds left!

797
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,500
Stop playing around, kill him!

798
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,750
End of round!

799
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,080
I told you to stop playing!

800
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,000
What are you doing?

801
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,120
The first half was almost a personal performance of Thoai Vuong!

802
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,250
But Lau Ka Kuen was able to withstand the fierce attacks!

803
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,120
Guidelines, what do you think?

804
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,250
Young people,

805
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,000
commendable spirit!

806
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,500
You can take a beating really well!

807
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,120
The first half took a lot of energy!

808
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,370
You can fight back!

809
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,750
Remember, as long as you don't get knocked down, you still have a chance!

810
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,120
I don't want to see you playing with him anymore!

811
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,500
Oh my god!

812
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,500
I am!

813
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,870
Guidelines, want to predict more?

814
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,750
Silva will probably play more seriously this round.

815
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,000
I think Lau Ka Kuen probably won't last 30 seconds.

816
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,500
Go!

817
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,500
See!

818
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,120
I told you so!

819
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,370
Keep it up!

820
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
A Quyen, you can do it!

821
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,620
You can do it, keep it up!

822
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,370
Silva's moves are too flashy.

823
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,960
Lack of damage.

824
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,120
Let go, let go!

825
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,500
Let go!

826
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,370
Back off, back off!

827
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Because this tournament prohibits attacking fallen fighters,

828
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,000
Silva gets a yellow card!

829
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,750
Follow the rules!

830
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,750
What to do, he's a freak!

831
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,330
And yet using underground techniques.

832
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,250
What a mess!

833
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,000
Follow the rules, you piece of shit!

834
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,750
Go!

835
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,120
Keep your focus, keep your focus!

836
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Lau Ka Quyen counterattacked again!

837
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,000
Up!

838
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,750
Don't let it recover!

839
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,250
Come on, come on!

840
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,870
What is this trick?

841
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,500
You don't know this?

842
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,000
That's a lion dance!

843
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,870
End of round!

844
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,500
Good job!

845
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,370
Good job A Quyen!

846
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,870
I didn't expect this match to last until the third round!

847
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,120
To be honest, Lau Ka-Kuan's resilience is beyond my expectations!

848
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,250
His counter-attack moves are very unorthodox!

849
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,250
Traditional martial arts moves on the ring are ineffective!

850
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,790
Current score of Lau Ka-Kuan,

851
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,870
far behind Silva!

852
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,750
Don't swallow, spit it out!

853
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,250
This kid's legs aren't bad either!

854
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,500
Lion dance competition mainly uses feet.

855
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,370
We used to compete in lion dance!

856
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,120
Okay, okay.

857
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,870
That guy is exhausted.

858
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,500
The vacuum exit speed is no longer that fast.

859
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,370
Don't just dodge!

860
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,500
Must charge in!

861
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,120
Understand?

862
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,120
Kick its fulcrum!

863
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,000
Ready?

864
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:53,920
Go!

865
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,620
Watch the distance!

866
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,870
Kick it, kick it

867
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,870
Silva kicked Lau Ka Kuen in the knee!

868
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,620
My ankle seems to be injured!

869
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,500
Attack its right leg!

870
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,370
Okay!

871
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Good!

872
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,250
Luu Gia Quyen TKO Silva!

873
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,120
Beyond expectations

874
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,750
A spectacular comeback!

875
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,370
Sometimes luck is also a part of strength.

876
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,370
If Silva wasn't too subjective,

877
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,870
Lau Ka-Kuan cannot be so lucky.

878
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,620
This kid,

879
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,120
should be fine.

880
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,000
Winner!

881
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,120
Lau Ka Quyen!

882
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,750
Round three, 21 seconds, TKO Silva!

883
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,370
Now, please invite a representative of one of the tournament sponsors,

884
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,000
Mr. Kim Moc Duong of Kim Ham Martial Arts Club went on stage,

885
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,370
awarding the ticket to the scoring round to Lau Ka-Kuan!

886
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,250
Come here, come here!

887
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,250
Dear viewers, don't change the channel!

888
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,460
After a short break, the qualifying round of Group B will begin!

889
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
The confrontation between the hottest star boxers today,

890
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,620
Tieu Truong Duong of Kim Ham Martial Arts Club,

891
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,120
and Thinh Bang Phi of Bang Phi martial arts school!

892
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,750
The ultimate match is about to begin!

893
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,500
Welcome back!
After a break,

894
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,870
we continue to broadcast live today's match!

895
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,670
Wait a minute!

896
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,210
Start.

897
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:17,370
What a perfect combination of speed, power and technique!

898
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,000
Tieu Truong Duong is indeed worthy of his name,

899
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,870
- the cross-generational martial arts star! - Luckily I'm not in the same group as him!

900
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,620
Across generations, what about before that?

901
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,620
At that time, traditional martial arts schools were not like today,

902
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,620
everyone loves to support.

903
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,500
Cau Chan Martial Arts School has been a brand for decades.

904
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,370
Me then,

905
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,500
is the eldest disciple of Ba Tieu Vu, also gets the benefit.

906
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,870
At that time, Kim Ham martial arts school was still a small and little-known martial arts school.

907
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,620
Tieu Truong Duong is still a rookie.

908
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,870
But they are very cunning.

909
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Discovering that traditional martial arts are not good at fighting in the ring,

910
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:01,870
went everywhere saying traditional martial arts are a game.

911
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,000
Traditional martial arts practitioners,

912
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,250
very proud.

913
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,750
Take turns accepting the challenge.

914
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,870
The result is a loss.

915
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,870
It is an internal matter within the industry,

916
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,170
was turned into a story exposing fraud and spread everywhere.

917
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,620
The reputation of traditional martial arts schools is getting worse and worse.

918
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,750
The Kim Ham and Tieu Truong Duong martial arts schools are becoming more and more famous.

919
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,000
Master is not in good health and cannot go up to the ring.

920
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,370
But I am not convinced.

921
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,420
Can traditional martial arts fight?

922
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,870
I am the one who wants to prove it more than anyone else.

923
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,000
What is the result?

924
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,620
I lost.

925
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,250
Its punches are heavy.

926
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,370
Hit my eye, also ruined our reputation.

927
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,750
At that time she had just gone abroad to study.

928
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,370
Your father and I kept these things from you.

929
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,750
But then no matter how hard we tried,

930
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,500
The business of the martial arts school could not recover.

931
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,370
I am not convinced!

932
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,370
Started looking for all kinds of research materials,

933
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,250
watch matches abroad.

934
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,750
Modern martial arts also developed from tradition.

935
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,500
Our traditional martial arts want to develop,

936
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,250
then must learn modern methods,

937
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,870
improvement and innovation,

938
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,370
figure out how to adapt to modern rules.

939
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,250
These are my notes over the years.

940
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,120
I have always had the intention of regaining what I lost.

941
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,750
But my eyes,

942
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,750
everything still looks blurry now.

943
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,750
I think maybe God just gave me one chance.

944
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,620
I've used it all up.

945
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,000
The scoring round will start after one month,

946
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,870
lasts three months.

947
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,750
There are not many experts.

948
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,620
So,

949
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,250
play and practice at the same time.

950
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,500
You might have a chance.

951
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,620
The big job is up to you!

952
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,500
- Um, um, no problem! - No problem!

953
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,120
I will try my best to teach.

954
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,750
How far can you go,

955
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,250
it depends on your luck.

956
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,750
Start practicing!

957
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,870
Your lion dance background is very useful.

958
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Plus martial arts training methods,

959
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
is able to turn your footwork into a finishing blow.

960
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,370
This one move alone isn't enough.

961
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,750
How can this martial arts school make as much money as a restaurant, right?

962
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,370
Ideals are not worth the money, baby!

963
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,120
How many more matches do you think the kid at your gym can win?

964
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,500
Modern combat martial arts is a competitive sport.

965
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:52,500
Their way of playing,

966
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:58,120
is to defeat the opponent according to the rules of the ring that develops.

967
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:02,250
Traditional Chinese martial arts are battlefield defense techniques.

968
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,370
Many moves are prohibited by the rules of the ring.

969
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,250
So very passive.

970
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,370
So what now?

971
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,750
They have their rules,

972
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,500
we have our way of playing.

973
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,250
Borrow strength to fight strength.

974
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,620
Improvise.

975
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,210
This is a combination of attack and defense.

976
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,120
The secret is just one word.

977
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,250
What letter?

978
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,500
Roll!

979
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,500
The body must be flexible.

980
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,290
Neutralize the opponent's force.

981
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,120
It's strong, let it be strong,

982
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,000
a gentle wind blew across the mountainside.

983
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,000
The rising star of this tournament, Lau Ka-Kuan,

984
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,750
has won three consecutive matches.

985
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,500
- In the eyes of many audiences... - Isn't this A Quyen?

986
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
- He is a traditional Chinese martial artist on the stage.. - Didn't realize he knew how to punch!

987
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,370
Representation and hope!

988
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,370
- Facing the audience's expectations... - Didn't you work with him?

989
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,870
- What do you think? - Look at that person!

990
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,000
I think it's mainly the coach's training method that is very effective.

991
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,290
We traditional warriors,

992
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,870
must preserve tradition,

993
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,460
must also have the courage to change.

994
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,500
Only demand new, demand change,

995
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,750
finally can ask for legs!

996
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,250
- What do you want to do? - Tieu Truong Duong.

997
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,830
- Go out, go out! - Can we take a picture together?

998
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,000
No problem.

999
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,250
Come here!

1000
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,370
Reporter Tu, can you help us take a photo?

1001
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,370
Okay!

1002
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,750
Everyone stand close to the middle!

1003
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,870
Come here!

1004
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,870
One, two, three!

1005
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,250
The number one seeded boxer of this tournament,

1006
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,000
Tieu Truong Duong of Kim Ham Martial Arts Club,

1007
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,120
extraordinary strength,

1008
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,750
famous reputation.

1009
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,620
His punch was heavy.

1010
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,620
No wonder coach Truong's eyes were damaged by it.

1011
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,000
It's not time to worry about it yet.

1012
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,250
If you don't get the first place in the table.

1013
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,120
I can't even touch his face.

1014
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,120
Look at this guy first.

1015
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,870
This Thai has over a hundred battles experience.

1016
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,620
More than ten years of hard work.

1017
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,870
In the same group as us.

1018
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,620
With A Quyen's current strength,

1019
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,540
don't say you beat him,

1020
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,870
It's already difficult to win the whole battle.

1021
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,120
Want to get into top 4 sooner or later.

1022
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,370
Must prepare in advance.

1023
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,250
Is there any way?

1024
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,120
No.

1025
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,750
I leave people, leave signs.

1026
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,750
So what do you give up?

1027
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:51,870
Sincerely.

1028
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,580
I give up.

1029
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,620
There is also a professional business plan.

1030
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,120
Lonely girl,

1031
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,120
unknown honest fighter.

1032
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,370
Comfort each other's lonely souls.

1033
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,370
Don't move!

1034
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,000
Her blood was a little hot.

1035
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:16,000
The desire for money is too strong.

1036
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,000
You should cultivate your mind and character,

1037
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,500
soon with the red dust,

1038
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,500
break off, give up, leave.

1039
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,920
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

1040
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,500
} Get out of the way!

1041
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,620
See weeds as your opponents!

1042
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,000
Start practicing!

1043
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,120
*Speed up!

1044
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,040
Focus a little.

1045
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,120
On the arena, compete in intelligence and courage!

1046
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:33,120
A good strategy is to use the weak to defeat the strong!

1047
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:36,370
Age is Arsan's only weakness.

1048
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,870
If you really fight, his stamina will decrease faster than yours.

1049
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,250
If you can be like this weed,

1050
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,250
makes him unable to see through, unable to defeat,

1051
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,870
last until the third round,

1052
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,870
the reaction rate will slow down,

1053
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,870
a hidden blow behind the back,

1054
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,620
is able to defeat him.

1055
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,370
So what is the secret?

1056
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,750
That year the Four Great Vajras were at the Shanghai docks,

1057
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,870
other than me,

1058
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,120
there are three others.

1059
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,620
They also have some tricks up their sleeves.

1060
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,620
Just don't know,

1061
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,750
years passed,

1062
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,250
are they still as stubborn as before?

1063
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
The ultimate acupressure technique of martial arts.

1064
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,370
Specializes in hitting weak points on the body.

1065
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,250
Use the least amount of force to achieve the greatest results.

1066
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,250
Where to hit on the ring,

1067
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,620
how you play is equally important.

1068
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Come in.

1069
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,620
That hand, that force!

1070
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,250
Come here, come here, let me take a good look!

1071
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,370
Raise high!

1072
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,500
Wipe quickly!

1073
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,250
Cover it tightly!

1074
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,250
You're sweating, Mr. Vuong!

1075
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,120
Oh!

1076
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,750
Little Zhang is here!

1077
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,000
Use your brain!

1078
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:01,250
Welcome, welcome!

1079
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,120
Long time no see!

1080
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,250
Come here, inside!

1081
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,500
Guests are coming, pour some water!

1082
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,620
Little Zhang!

1083
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,120
Unexpected, right?

1084
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,370
Phich Lich Duong's business has gotten bigger in recent years.

1085
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,000
Now there are more than 30 disciples.

1086
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,620
Ly family!

1087
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,500
This kid goes up to the ring,

1088
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:16,870
now having a little trouble.

1089
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,500
Please show him some acupressure techniques.

1090
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,250
Chinese style massage,

1091
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,120
tend tendons and promote blood circulation.

1092
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,870
Major celestial orbit, minor celestial orbit.

1093
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Ice and fire reach the ninth heaven.

1094
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,250
Which set do you want to learn?

1095
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,120
don't you have to enter my door first before talking?

1096
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,250
What else can we say about the subject now!

1097
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,750
That year lost in the ring,

1098
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,120
don't you want to regain some face?

1099
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,750
What competition, what loss?

1100
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,000
- What does martial arts have to do with me? - Listen to me!

1101
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I am now curing and saving people!

1102
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,250
Stop talking nonsense here!

1103
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,500
Get out of my sight!

1104
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,250
Listen to me!

1105
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,870
Crazy!

1106
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
This master's craftsmanship is not bad.

1107
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,370
Those tricks are effective,

1108
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,000
why couldn't they beat Tieu Truong Duong?

1109
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,620
Traditional martial arts masters emphasize verbal sparring,

1110
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,120
too little combat experience.

1111
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,750
Physical strength is not good enough either.

1112
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,870
Going to the ring to meet a master like Tieu Truong Duong,

1113
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,250
had not yet used the ultimate move but was already heavily beaten.

1114
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,250
But these moves rarely appear in the ring.

1115
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,870
Just need the opportunity to use it to surprise the opponent.

1116
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,870
Here it is.

1117
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,000
It's not just Muay Thai that has elbow techniques,

1118
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,870
Our traditional martial arts also have elbow techniques.

1119
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,000
Dragon Elbow. (Dragon Elbow)

1120
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,500
An inch short, an inch dangerous.

1121
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,370
Unpredictable changes.

1122
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,120
It's her.

1123
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,250
Long time no see, Ms. Hoa!

1124
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,500
Isn't Thirteen Points right next door to your house?

1125
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,620
A day without seeing each other is like three autumns!

1126
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:52,620
We haven't seen each other for only half an hour!

1127
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,250
Fuck!

1128
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,750
Watt to!

1129
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:58,790
Running this far to take care of your business, brother!

1130
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:01,000
Brothers come here today,

1131
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:03,750
I want to ask for your Dragon Wine technique.

1132
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,000
Oh!

1133
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,620
That thing,

1134
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,370
let go, can't pick it up again.

1135
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,000
This kid has to compete.

1136
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:16,370
As seniors, we must help out no matter what.

1137
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,250
Stop it, stop it.

1138
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,250
Go home and find a decent job,

1139
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,500
is better than being beaten to a pulp.

1140
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,120
Thirteen Points!

1141
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,370
Ms. Hoa, Ms. Hoa!

1142
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,250
Get a pig's leg!

1143
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,120
Here comes the next one,

1144
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,500
left hand flips the clouds,

1145
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,370
right hand covering the rain.

1146
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,250
Both hands out,

1147
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,870
evil spirits are unpredictable.

1148
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,500
The method is called,

1149
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,120
Yin Yang Hand!

1150
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,000
Let me show you!

1151
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,000
Look carefully!

1152
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,620
This magic trick of mine,

1153
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,250
like dew and like electricity,

1154
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,370
like a dream!

1155
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,500
Be with!

1156
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,370
This is a treasure!

1157
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,750
- I want it, I want it! - Give me one!

1158
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,080
One by one, no fighting!

1159
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:17,250
Go home and ask your parents for money!

1160
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,250
Uncle Minh!

1161
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,500
Long time no see!

1162
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,250
Lau Ka Quyen!

1163
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,500
I know.

1164
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:23,620
Then,

1165
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,500
look carefully!

1166
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,120
No more!

1167
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,750
What is this?

1168
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,370
Ruyi Jingu,Ruyi Jingu!

1169
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,420
For you!

1170
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,500
Little known,

1171
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:45,120
new trick works!

1172
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,620
This tournament is also broadcast live,

1173
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,750
are all turned back!

1174
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,750
Isn't this exposing all my tricks?

1175
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,870
My children!

1176
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,500
Is that right?

1177
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,250
Yes, yes!

1178
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,370
These old-fashioned people!

1179
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,580
The giang ho is no more,

1180
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,500
they are still in the giang ho.

1181
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,120
Any other tricks?

1182
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Play the match first.

1183
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,620
Recover your score and then talk!

1184
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,620
A Quyen, can I borrow you for half a day?

1185
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I didn't mean to bother you.

1186
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,250
But there is an investor who says he must meet you.

1187
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,620
But I can't talk.

1188
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:25,620
It's okay.

1189
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,750
So let me say.

1190
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,500
You just sit next to me and eat a lot.

1191
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,370
Come in.

1192
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,370
Two young men!

1193
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,330
Come here, come here, come in, come in!

1194
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,460
Sit sit.

1195
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,540
Sit down and talk.

1196
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,000
Thanks.

1197
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,120
Kim Ham Club.

1198
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,870
Kim Moc Duong.

1199
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,500
It's hard to imagine,

1200
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,250
a newbie can achieve this feat

1201
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,120
in just three short months.

1202
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,620
I don't dare, I don't dare.

1203
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,370
If you have something to say, just say it.

1204
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:12,620
Here, here!

1205
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,750
Order first!

1206
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,620
The steak here is delicious!

1207
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,500
Let's eat and talk!

1208
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,370
I see you,

1209
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,000
like seeing myself twenty years ago.

1210
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,250
That year,

1211
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,250
a group of us went to Shanghai,

1212
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,870
desperate to hold on.

1213
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,370
But later I found out,

1214
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,120
big cities are worlds of reinforced concrete.

1215
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,040
People like us want to rise up,

1216
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,420
Does Xiao Wu not like to drink soup?

1217
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,120
I am a vegetarian.

1218
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,120
Young man!

1219
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,250
A salad for this lady.

1220
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,370
Yes.

1221
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:51,870
Tieu Vu has recently been running around looking for investments,

1222
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,370
is it hard?

1223
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,870
Martial arts is a small industry,

1224
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,170
still young,

1225
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,750
finding investment is not easy.

1226
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,000
Outsiders who don't do it won't know.

1227
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,370
How many years have I been in this industry?

1228
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,750
understands too well.

1229
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,120
Or,

1230
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,000
let's work together.

1231
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,420
They are all old acquaintances.

1232
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:11,210
Cooperation?

1233
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,710
How to cooperate?

1234
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,620
I like straightforward people like you.

1235
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,620
It must be known that,

1236
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,870
the later you find investment,

1237
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
The risk of losing your home is even greater.

1238
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,750
It's not a good idea to wait until the court starts the auction proceedings.

1239
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,870
Like this,

1240
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,750
I help you keep the house,

1241
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,250
then gave her an investment,

1242
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,870
she renovated the martial arts school really well,

1243
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,120
people come to do business,

1244
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:36,250
we do business together.

1245
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,250
Say the conditions directly.

1246
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,620
Somewhat effective.

1247
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,500
Just one small request.

1248
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,000
Speak.

1249
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,870
Hanging the Kim Ham Club sign.

1250
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:48,750
That won't work.

1251
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,370
It's just a name.

1252
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,620
Hanging Kim Ham signboard,

1253
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,120
can make more money than you guys did before.

1254
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,250
Boss Kim,

1255
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,370
wishing you soon unify the world.

1256
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,000
We are not available to talk anymore.

1257
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,750
Let's go!

1258
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,000
Bad mood.

1259
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,750
Come with me to a place.

1260
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,750
I still have to practice.

1261
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,250
It's okay to be a little lazy sometimes.

1262
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,250
My father used to take me here to play.

1263
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,750
Really?

1264
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,000
Do you think I'm too much?

1265
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,870
Sometimes a little.

1266
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,750
Don't look at that smiling boss Kim,

1267
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,750
are actually all fake.

1268
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,870
I don't understand these things either.

1269
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,250
The mind can't keep up.

1270
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,250
So were you full just now?

1271
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,370
Not yet.

1272
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,870
Not used to eating.

1273
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,120
You see,

1274
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,500
that street,

1275
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,120
right, the second one,

1276
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,500
that red-roofed house,

1277
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,370
that is Cau Chan martial arts school.

1278
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,040
It's also my home.

1279
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,500
The first time my dad took me on the Ferris wheel,

1280
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:32,120
As soon as the light turned on, my father told me to make a wish.

1281
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,620
But I'm afraid of heights,

1282
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,120
pointed in this direction and said,

1283
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,750
I want to go home.

1284
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,750
Dad has always been the pillar of this family.

1285
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:48,620
It was only after my father passed away that I realized how difficult all of this was.

1286
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,870
And Truong Watt,

1287
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,500
is like my family.

1288
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,870
I know he can't do anything but boxing.

1289
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,500
Otherwise people wouldn't call him Watt.

1290
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,500
Actually, coach Truong is very good.

1291
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,620
Just put all your effort into boxing.

1292
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,620
That's right,

1293
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:08,000
How far have you guys researched your weed strategy?

1294
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,870
Still haven't figured out what to hide behind the weeds.

1295
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I will definitely think of it.

1296
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,120
Look ahead!

1297
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,120
Use your imagination!

1298
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,000
Under the sunset,

1299
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,370
next to the classroom,

1300
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,370
the weeds under that magnolia tree.

1301
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,120
See?

1302
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,500
What's behind this patch of weed?

1303
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,750
Can't see.

1304
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,250
What about you?

1305
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,500
The light is on.

1306
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,750
Say your wish.

1307
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:50,120
I want to play well in the next match.

1308
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,500
And then what?

1309
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:56,000
I want to be in top 4, win the prize money.

1310
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:57,620
And then what?

1311
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,250
Pick up your parents here.

1312
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,250
Use your imagination!

1313
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,870
Be brave!

1314
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,750
Let me help you.

1315
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,250
A Quyen will have a big house,

1316
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,500
large car,

1317
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,500
take your parents on a trip around the world.

1318
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,830
First stop is America.

1319
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,120
I will be your tour guide.

1320
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,620
Carina Lau Boxes in Hollywood!

1321
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,500
You see,

1322
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:18,250
what a great story!

1323
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,250
I dare not think of these things.

1324
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:21,870
You try so hard,

1325
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,620
have confidence in yourself!

1326
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,370
I feel much better now.

1327
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
Thank you.

1328
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,870
I'm happy too.

1329
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,250
Wait for me to be in top 4,

1330
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,000
I give you a gift.

1331
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,000
What gift is it?

1332
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,750
Keep secret for now.

1333
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,620
Come here, come here!

1334
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,000
A Quyen's match has begun!

1335
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,620
Next, please invite Cau Chan martial arts school,

1336
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,620
- Lau Ka-Kuan! - What's interesting to see!

1337
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,370
Background music or change to another song.

1338
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,750
Got it!

1339
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:16,620
Lau Ka Kuen's powerful footwork KO'd her opponent!

1340
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,120
The signature foot technique of Lau Ka Kuen,

1341
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,620
KOs opponent again!

1342
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,120
Unknown martial artist Lau Ka Kuen quickly became famous!

1343
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,330
Recently, netizens discovered that he and his friends

1344
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:34,370
run a night food stall at the night market!

1345
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,250
Business is especially booming!

1346
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,960
For traditional martial artist Lau Ka Kuen

1347
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,750
has had outstanding achievements recently, how do you rate it?

1348
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,830
I heard he sells salted fish at the night market.

1349
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,370
So he should know,

1350
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,000
salty fish flips over,

1351
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:46,870
still salted fish.

1352
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,870
Coach Tieu!

1353
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,250
Are you looking forward to seeing the two of you duel in the ring?

1354
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:54,620
I can't wait to fight it!

1355
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:56,370
Salty fish or rotten fish anyway,

1356
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,370
must try it to know!

1357
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,370
Right?

1358
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,370
What?

1359
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,750
Do you still want to go back to being a thug?

1360
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,750
I just find it annoying!

1361
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,120
You represent our club!

1362
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,620
Watch your words!

1363
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,750
This kid is either talented,

1364
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,870
or be in trouble!

1365
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,370
You guys!

1366
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,500
Show me the lion dance!

1367
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,370
Mom!

1368
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,120
Have you received the money?

1369
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Correct

1370
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,370
Salary increase.

1371
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,000
Cau Chan Martial Arts School!

1372
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,620
Lau Ka Quyen!

1373
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:05,750
Martial artist Lau Ka-Kuan of Cau Chan martial arts school wins!

1374
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,370
The game is tomorrow!

1375
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,000
Don't be distracted!

1376
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:41,620
If we win, maybe there will be a change!

1377
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,870
Today is the final match of the scoring round of the Cach Dau Chi Da tournament!

1378
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,750
The top 4 of this tournament will be decided tonight!

1379
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,000
Welcome representatives of Cau Chan martial arts school,

1380
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:58,370
Lau Ka Quyen!

1381
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,870
This young warrior,

1382
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,250
has brought us so many surprises!

1383
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:12,250
One of the most popular fighters today!

1384
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,870
But tonight,

1385
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,620
waiting for him is definitely not an easy game!

1386
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Next, please invite Lau Ka-Kuan's opponent,

1387
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:35,250
Siamese Tiger,

1388
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:38,250
He said!

1389
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,000
He said!

1390
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,500
Professional record 128 wins, 10 losses.

1391
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:56,120
In which there were 65 KOs!

1392
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,000
Muay Thai is powerful and fierce!

1393
01:11:58,130 --> 01:11:59,370
The Siamese Tiger!

1394
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,870
Point like a knife!

1395
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,370
Pillow like a spear thrower!

1396
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,500
As it approaches,

1397
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,370
must pay attention to his elbow!

1398
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,620
The vacuum cannot stop!

1399
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,370
Be careful not to get backed into a corner!

1400
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,120
Stare into his eyes!

1401
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,500
Currently, Lau Ka-Kuan is 3 points behind.

1402
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:38,500
He can only win if he KOs Arsan by 4 points.

1403
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:39,750
Guidelines, what do you think?

1404
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,120
This probability is extremely small!

1405
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,500
Go!

1406
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,000
Strike, strike!

1407
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,120
Pay attention to the force!

1408
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,370
Arsan is really a man of iron!

1409
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,500
The difference is too big!

1410
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,960
Charge in, charge in!

1411
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,750
Lau Ka-Kuan's forehead is torn!

1412
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,870
This is called a knife-like elbow!

1413
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,750
Pay attention to the rhythm!

1414
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,620
Keep your focus!

1415
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:55,870
Lau Gia Quyen's finishing move was easily neutralized by Arsan, knee!

1416
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,750
Put it in the corner!

1417
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,250
Corner!

1418
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,120
Hug your legs, hug your legs!

1419
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:09,000
Lau Ka-Kuan knows that he can't win a direct fight,

1420
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:11,120
used the trick!

1421
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,120
Get ready!

1422
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,790
Go!

1423
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,500
Move more!

1424
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:27,250
Keep going, keep going!

1425
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,500
Pay attention to the rhythm!

1426
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,750
Stick to it!

1427
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,750
Rhythm don't be out of tune, rhythm don't be out of tune!

1428
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,620
- Protect your head, regulate your breathing! - Arsan is truly worthy of the title of Siamese Tiger!

1429
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:37,500
Corner your prey and tear it apart!

1430
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:38,250
Lau Ka Quyen is in danger!
10 seconds left!

1431
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,370
Keep it up!

1432
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,000
Strike!

1433
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:44,370
Attack, attack!

1434
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,620
What are you doing?

1435
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,000
Why don't you ring the bell?

1436
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,620
According to our time!

1437
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,120
Do you still have any shame?

1438
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,750
- What's there to be afraid of! - Calm down, calm down!

1439
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:16,620
- End of round! - Stop it, stop it!

1440
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,620
It's over, it's over!

1441
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,250
Give me a yellow card!

1442
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,370
I give you a yellow card!

1443
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,750
You are richer than me, you know that!

1444
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:26,750
We see,

1445
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:27,870
because of doubting the referee,

1446
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,370
Luu Gia Quyen's coach received a yellow card!

1447
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,620
These bastards are too much!

1448
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:33,750
I want to complain!

1449
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,250
What's wrong?

1450
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,750
Just a little misunderstanding!

1451
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Move more!

1452
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,120
Hit him around.

1453
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,290
Try to dodge the elbow strike.

1454
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,870
His strength is too great.

1455
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,870
Look at me!

1456
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,370
Only one chance!

1457
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,620
Like weeds,

1458
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,870
rooted firmly into the ring!

1459
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,460
Go!

1460
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,370
Find the right drop point!

1461
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,000
Pay attention to the force!

1462
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,250
Strike, strike!

1463
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:33,750
- What the hell!
This is a foul move!

1464
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,500
Is this countdown controversial?

1465
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:37,500
Why countdown?

1466
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,120
- Didn't you see he broke the rules just now? - Don't be in such a hurry!

1467
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:39,870
By rule,

1468
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,250
don't hit after falling!

1469
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,250
Guide lines!

1470
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,250
Arsan is really pushing too hard!

1471
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,120
But Lau Ka Kuen is standing up!

1472
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,370
- Strictly speaking, it's not a fall - Put your hands out!

1473
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:51,620
- With your level, you can still be a referee? - He said slowly!

1474
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,500
You guys!

1475
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,500
You guys are too dark!
Follow the referee!

1476
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,250
Still feel ashamed?

1477
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,750
Go!

1478
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,000
Why did you take people away without permission?

1479
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,250
- I object, I object! - Are you going to give any reasons?

1480
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,620
Haven't you any shame!

1481
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,120
The coach of Lau Ka-Kuan received a red card and was sent off!

1482
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:20,000
Lau Ka Kuen should probably reduce the number of times she uses her feet.

1483
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:23,370
What was originally a great move has now become a weakness.

1484
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,120
The coach was no longer there either.

1485
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,120
What to do now?

1486
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,120
A Quyen!

1487
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,620
You have to be careful!

1488
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,620
This match is not good!

1489
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,120
Let it lose miserably!

1490
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,750
Okay, no problem!

1491
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,370
KO him!

1492
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,750
No problem!

1493
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,750
Last round!

1494
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,620
Rely on yourself!

1495
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,620
Go!

1496
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,500
Okay!

1497
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,870
Nice!

1498
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,750
It feels like Liu Jiajuan is starting to use force!

1499
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,370
Guide lines!

1500
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,870
Do you think he still has a chance to turn the tables?

1501
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,870
Lau Ka Kuen is young,

1502
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
relatively better physical condition.

1503
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,620
But it's a bit late to use force now.

1504
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,620
Good luck to him!
Keep it up!

1505
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,120
This kick was so unexpected!

1506
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,370
Thai style sweep stone!

1507
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,000
Fast, accurate, dangerous!

1508
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,960
Let's see if Lau Ka-Kuan can take it!

1509
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:51,250
In the third round, Arsan's stamina and accuracy both declined.

1510
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,120
I'm old anyway.

1511
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,250
If this kick happened in the first half,

1512
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,120
Lau Ka Quyen definitely could not stand up.

1513
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,120
Charge in, charge in!

1514
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,620
Lau Gia Quyen's condition deteriorated very quickly!

1515
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:09,620
Looks like that kick just now had a big impact!

1516
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,120
Half a minute left in the match!

1517
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,750
There is no need to argue about victory or defeat.

1518
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,040
As long as Lau Ka-Kuan doesn't get KO'd, it's considered a win!

1519
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Get ready!

1520
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,120
Go!

1521
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:28,500
It must be said that,

1522
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,500
Lau Ka Kuen is a newcomer,

1523
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,620
achieved achievements far beyond his ability,

1524
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,870
has a very large luck component.

1525
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Now,

1526
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:39,370
luck has run out!

1527
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:33,000
If you can be like this weed,

1528
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,250
makes him unable to see through, unable to defeat,

1529
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:39,000
a hidden blow behind the back,

1530
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:42,500
is able to defeat him.

1531
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:28,750
Unbelievable!

1532
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,250
Lau Ka Kuen jumps and kicks!

1533
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:33,750
Turn the tables!

1534
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,000
So cool!

1535
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,370
This is the fighting arena!

1536
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,370
Never say give up until the last second!

1537
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:13,870
Luu Gia Quyen, round three, 2 minutes 45 seconds, KO victory!

1538
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,920
Next, we would like to invite the representative of the main sponsor of the season, Ctrip–Travel,

1539
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,750
awarding tickets to the semi-finals of the Cach Dau Chi Da tournament!

1540
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,870
Each fighter who enters the semi-finals will receive 100,000 prize money!

1541
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,120
The champion will receive 300,000!

1542
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,370
All tournament prizes will be awarded on the final day of the Battle of the Night!

1543
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,870
Please continue to follow the matches of Cach Dau Chi Da

1544
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,120
Thank you for coming!

1545
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:35,120
Today's match ends here!

1546
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,620
Mom, how are you and dad these days?

1547
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,870
Many investors have actively sought me out.

1548
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,500
I will buy the house back when the investment money comes back.

1549
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:47,120
We're in the semi-finals!

1550
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,250
They will definitely look at us differently!

1551
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,000
But I'm worried about A Quyen.

1552
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:54,000
I wonder what other tricks Kim Moc Duong is up to behind my back.

1553
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:56,000
What if I don't hit anymore?

1554
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,870
If you drop out of the competition, you will lose your prize money.

1555
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,120
My parents will come here next month.

1556
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,620
Did you tell them about your boxing?

1557
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,000
Not yet.

1558
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:06,620
Don't want them to worry.

1559
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,120
We did not aim to win the semi-final.

1560
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,290
Just do a good defense.

1561
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,750
Food is here!

1562
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,500
A Quyen!

1563
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,000
A Quyen does not drink alcohol.

1564
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,370
There is still a competition.

1565
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,370
A Quyen!

1566
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,250
You're very, very good to have made it to the semi-finals!

1567
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,250
Safety first in the next match!

1568
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:25,500
Waiting for the gym to open,

1569
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:28,250
even if we don't win the championship, we still won!

1570
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,120
No matter what,
I will fight to the end too!

1571
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,000
I told you the calendar I looked at never expires!

1572
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:32,750
Cheers!
Smooth sailing!

1573
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,500
Come here, come here!

1574
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:36,000
Cheers, cheers!

1575
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,120
Cheers!

1576
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,370
What are you guys doing here?

1577
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:45,120
Who is it?

1578
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,250
Sorry, sorry!

1579
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,000
We had dinner here.

1580
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,120
Night snack?

1581
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:50,330
What are you doing here for dinner?

1582
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:51,250
Go away!

1583
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,620
Construction is due tomorrow!

1584
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,120
Go now!

1585
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:09,870
To pull out weeds, you must pull them out by the roots!

1586
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,750
Nothing to worry about.

1587
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,870
I just KO it.

1588
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,750
This is a drama.

1589
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,500
Whether we succeed or not is not decided by our opponents,

1590
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,000
which is the audience.

1591
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:24,250
Martial arts genius learns traditional martial arts.

1592
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:26,750
Anonymous boy knows how to dance the lion.

1593
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,620
If that kid makes it to the semi-finals,

1594
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:33,500
whose story do you think the audience will like more?

1595
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:40,000
If that girl finds investment again, we will be very passive.

1596
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,000
Business is like boxing,

1597
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:46,120
If you don't win, you lose.

1598
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,370
I can't lose.

1599
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,620
You can't either.

1600
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,120
Drink less.

1601
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,500
Do not affect the state.

1602
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,120
I can't sleep.

1603
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,000
Same as before,

1604
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,250
just close your eyes,

1605
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:10,620
is dreaming of being knocked down in the ring.

1606
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,500
Is it because I haven't lost for too long?

1607
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:18,370
I'm about to forget what it feels like to actually lose a game.

1608
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,500
But in the dream,

1609
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
I have never won.

1610
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,370
I know you're tired.

1611
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:29,870
Wait for this tournament to end,

1612
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,870
I will recruit the best warriors.

1613
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,620
We will dominate this industry.

1614
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,370
By then you won't need to worry about winning or losing anymore.

1615
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,500
So Lau Ka Quyen...

1616
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,250
Not according to my script,

1617
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:52,250
then let its story turn into an accident.

1618
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:08,000
The balcony is enough for basic physical exercise.

1619
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,870
Your phone.

1620
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,170
Hello, is this A Quyen?
Aunt Hoang.

1621
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,000
You should watch the news!

1622
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,620
I believe you!

1623
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,120
You don't do those things!

1624
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,460
But you have to explain!

1625
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,750
Look, hurry up!

1626
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,500
Recently,

1627
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,000
a netizen sent a video.

1628
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,120
Let's see.

1629
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,750
Verified,

1630
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,870
The fighter is a hot fighter on a martial arts reality show,

1631
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,620
Lau Ka Kuen.

1632
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,620
I have a few questions.

1633
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:52,870
One, should martial arts tournaments investigate the background of fighters?

1634
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,920
Avoid fighters with such bad records,

1635
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,370
became a public figure.

1636
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,540
For those fighters who compete in violation of good customs...

1637
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,500
The world is dangerous!

1638
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,000
Are there any relevant measures to punish them appropriately?

1639
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,250
Reporter Tu!

1640
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,370
Did you guys see that video?

1641
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,250
See it.

1642
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,620
That's not the case at all!

1643
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:11,120
We know who's playing!

1644
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,500
Will you tell the truth?

1645
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:21,870
They were a bunch of people bullying a girl!

1646
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,620
I did it to help Tieu Vu, but in a moment of anger, I attacked them!

1647
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:26,250
That's right!

1648
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,370
They came to our gym to cause trouble first!

1649
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,000
And still want to hit people!

1650
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:31,750
A Quyen saw a good cause and helped.

1651
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,120
Really?

1652
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,370
They were a group of people bullying a girl.

1653
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,620
A Quyen saw a good cause and helped.

1654
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,870
You still act noble while beating people!

1655
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,870
At first I thought,

1656
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,500
is the personal behavior of Lau Ka-Kuan.

1657
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:56,870
Unexpectedly, Cau Chan martial arts school was also involved.

1658
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,120
Moreover, this Cau Chan martial arts school was actually sealed long ago!

1659
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,500
Is a debt dodger!

1660
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:06,000
I am an employee of Kim Ham Club.

1661
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:07,750
Because Cau Chan martial arts school is right next door,

1662
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,620
we are all colleagues,

1663
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,120
inevitable back and forth.

1664
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,000
That day was probably because,

1665
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:14,370
say some things they don't like to hear,

1666
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,370
very suddenly,

1667
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,370
Lau Ka Quyen started to make his move.

1668
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,500
No martial ethics!

1669
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,210
Let's expose it!

1670
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:22,460
The dark history of Liu Jiaquan and the Qiuzhen martial arts school.

1671
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,000
Does anyone recognize who this is?

1672
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,460
Yes, it's Lau Ka-Kuan.

1673
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:27,500
The mouth that never stops talking represents traditional Chinese martial arts.

1674
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,830
Unexpectedly pretending to be Thai!

1675
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,120
Losing face internationally!

1676
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,250
I showed this video to my foreign friends,

1677
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,620
he said this is what Chinese kungfu is!

1678
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:42,620
This is Chinese kungfu!

1679
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:47,500
Lau Ka Kuen was once fired from a construction site for stealing steel bars!

1680
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,620
I heard this person has a criminal record!

1681
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,370
This should not be said carelessly!

1682
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,750
I am very close to Quyen!

1683
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,500
He is very honest.

1684
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,000
Expose scams, make money, kill it!!!

1685
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,370
If you have the guts, come out here and fight solo!

1686
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,870
How did it turn out so chaotic!

1687
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:52,750
The public opinion this time appeared very strange!

1688
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,250
In a flash, it spread everywhere, not very normal!

1689
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,370
Anyway,

1690
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,750
boxer beating people, fake beating is wrong!

1691
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,250
Will have a serious negative impact on the program!

1692
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:03,620
I see things are not that simple!

1693
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,750
Where is the proof?

1694
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,120
Making news cannot rely on guesswork!

1695
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:14,750
The beating incident continues to escalate!

1696
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,710
The Organizing Committee of Cach Dau Chi Da has decided to disqualify Lau Ka Quyen from competing!

1697
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,120
What a pity!

1698
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,370
Hope other fighters can restrain their behavior!

1699
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,870
Modern martial arts is competition in the ring!

1700
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,620
Emphasize fairness, justice, not gangsterism!

1701
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,120

You take this money.

1753
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:50,750
No.

1754
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,620
This is her father's house.

1755
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,120
Moreover, she still has to go to school.

1756
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,870
I can support myself.

1757
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,750
You helped my father for so long,

1758
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,500
this gym should have half of you.

1759
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:01,620
If my father were still alive,

1760
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:04,120
will do the same.

1761
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,620
Carry the bag!

1762
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:15,750
Pay daily!

1763
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,370
Whoever wants to do it, come on!

1764
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,120
You've done it before, right?

1765
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,500
Go!

1766
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,000
Three people are missing!

1767
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:25,370
We, we can!

1768
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,250
Ever done it?

1769
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,750
Done, done, done, done!

1770
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:29,000
Get in the car!

1771
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:30,870
Fast, fast, fast!

1772
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,250
You dare to use these three people with criminal records?

1773
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,870
Who did you say has a criminal record?

1774
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,620
What, don't admit it?

1775
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,670
It's been said on the internet, can it be fake?

1776
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:39,870
How can we use them?

1777
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,370
Hitting people!

1778
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,500
Use us!

1779
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:42,870
Just the three of you?

1780
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,250
Don't believe it!

1781
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:45,620
- None of that is true! - Nonsense!

1782
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:46,750
Do you believe anything I say?

1783
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,370
Go!

1784
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:52,750
Dare to do it?
Don't go!

1785
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,500
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding!

1786
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,120
Touch me! Misunderstanding, misunderstanding!

1787
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,120
Are you being reasonable?

1788
01:33:58,130 --> 01:33:59,120
Solo to!

1789
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:01,120
Wait for you!

1790
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,250
What do you want to do?

1791
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,500
Hitting people!

1792
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:05,870
Come help!

1793
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,370
The boxer beat someone!

1794
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,370
Come help!
Let go, let go!

1795
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:10,000
I don't have!
That's it!

1796
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,750
Go to hell!

1797
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,750
Professional boxer beats people!

1798
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:17,620
Someone's dead!

1799
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,120
He struck first!

1800
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:25,000
A Quyen!

1801
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,750
- Stop hitting! - Stop it, stop it!

1802
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,750
The police are here!

1803
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:38,250
- Young man, are you okay? - Get to the hospital!

1804
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,620
Mom!

1805
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,870
A Quyen!

1806
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,120
Have you eaten yet?

1807
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,120
Eaten.

1808
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,750
Are you still well, Dad?

1809
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,750
Healthy, healthy.

1810
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,620
A Quyen!

1811
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,870
If you're not busy lately,

1812
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,620
you go home and stay for a while.

1813
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:14,370
Yes, yes!
A Quyen!

1814
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,250
It's been a long time since you guys visited your master and mistress, huh?

1815
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,870
That's right, that's right!

1816
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:22,620
Now about,

1817
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,500
also has cloth to eat.

1818
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,750
Go home!

1819
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,120
Okay.

1820
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,000
I know, master.

1821
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,250
I want to go home.

1822
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:45,620
Okay.

1823
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,620
We go home.

1824
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:13,000
From now on, everyone everywhere will have friends!

1825
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:14,750
Guangdong morning tea!

1826
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,370
America eats hamburgers!

1827
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,500
There are people everywhere to welcome you!

1828
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,000
I can look presentable!

1829
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:21,370
Right?

1830
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:37,500
Your book.

1831
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,500
Keep it safe.

1832
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,120
The plane is about to take off.

1833
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:22,870
Please turn off your cell phone and wireless electronic devices.

1834
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:44,250
A Quyen.

1835
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:47,580
I'm so sorry for getting you and A Mieu and A Cau involved in this,

1836
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,750
suffered these injustices.

1837
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,870
There are 100,000 in this card.

1838
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,870
Please accept it.

1839
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,870
This is what you deserve.

1840
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:06,500
Hope that solves your immediate problem.

1841
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,870
I hope your father recovers soon.

1842
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,620
Wherever the future is,

1843
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,250
please never forget,

1844
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:17,500
the young man who used to write and draw in books.

1845
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:23,620
Look up and laugh loudly, my life is not a life of a grasshopper!

1846
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:25,750
Tieu Vu.

1847
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:50,500
The number you have dialed is currently turned off.

1848
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,870
I cannot accept this money.

1849
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,750
Take it.

1850
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,500
Not for myself.

1851
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:30,250
I'm looking for you guys!

1852
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,250
You guys are...

1853
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,370
Let's talk up there!

1854
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,000
I have some pictures here.

1855
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,870
Please help me out a bit.

1856
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:45,500
This is a photo taken after the match.

1857
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,000
Viewers,

1858
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:49,370
the hand bandage is torn.

1859
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,750
Other fighters don't seem to have this condition.

1860
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,580
Isn't a hand wrap a bandage?

1861
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,500
How can it be torn?

1862
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:12,120
Why does it look a bit like plaster?

1863
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,620
Gypsum?

1864
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,500
Gypsum removed?

1865
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:19,120
His arm is broken too!

1866
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:23,750
Doing so may cause your opponent to break bones!

1867
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:26,620
That year during the martial arts competition,

1868
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:32,000
I felt its punch hit me very hard, very hard.

1869
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:43,500
I always thought it had a special training method.

1870
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:45,370
Unexpectedly...

1871
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:50,500
Gypsum is something that is very easily overlooked.

1872
01:40:50,630 --> 01:40:53,500
Just put the plaster powder on the hand bandage,

1873
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:58,120
during competition, sweat on hands will turn plaster powder into plaster.

1874
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:01,500
This is the biggest scam!

1875
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:04,750
Can we go complain?

1876
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,870
It's useless.

1877
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,500
The game is over.

1878
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:08,870
Let's go expose him!

1879
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,250
A picture proves nothing!

1880
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:12,750
There is no evidence,

1881
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,120
exposing is counterproductive!

1882
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:19,750
They used a fake story to win it all!

1883
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,000
So what now?

1884
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:23,120
Just let it go like this?

1885
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,500
This was originally a match that could not be won!

1886
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:29,620
Go home!

1887
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,500
From today onwards,

1888
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,870
we will go through a series of activities,

1889
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,120
Looking for rising martial arts stars everywhere to join the Kim Ham family!

1890
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,620
We will continuously nurture,

1891
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:45,870
building generations of future stars loved by the public!

1892
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,370
I believe that under the guidance of our Kim Ham Martial Arts Club,

1893
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:52,000
after integrating resources and building the platform,

1894
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:56,750
martial arts will become a popular sport!

1895
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:01,620
Let's together breathe new life into the future of martial arts.

1896
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,620
Mr. Kim is really generous!

1897
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:10,870
Sign a contract with the hottest fighters of Cach Dau Chi Da in one breath!

1898
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:14,370
Boxing, Muay Thai, Brazilian Capoeira, Karate, Taekwondo!

1899
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,120
Any martial art technique you want to learn is here!

1900
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,370
Experts personally teach!

1901
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,250
- Real fight, real practice, real effort! - Why don't we have our traditional martial arts?

1902
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:23,250
Traditional martial arts are outdated.

1903
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:24,750
Can't get any result.

1904
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,500
These modern martial arts are more popular.

1905
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:35,620
Happy ending!

1906
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,250
Turns out there's another surprise!

1907
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:51,620
Our organizing committee is truly full of sincerity!

1908
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:14,000
This is a bit interesting!

1909
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,870
Are you inviting me to the lion dance today?

1910
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,620
No way!

1911
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,370
Hello everyone!

1912
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,960
I am Lau Ka-Kuan!

1913
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,120
The game is not over yet!

1914
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,750
What?

1915
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,870
We might have a chance to expose their scam!

1916
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,250
A Quyen!

1917
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,870
If we find them, we won't be able to get back what we lost!

1918
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Don't be stupid like me that year!

1919
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,500
I don't need anything!

1920
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:13,370
I must take back this spirit!

1921
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,500
A Quyen, what do you think we should do?

1922
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:20,870
I represent Cau Chan martial arts school to challenge Tieu Truong Duong!

1923
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:22,670
Little Xiao!

1924
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,710
No need.

1925
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:26,500
You!
Get down for me, do you hear me!

1926
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:28,500
Come down here, do you hear?
- Say it again! - What are you doing?

1927
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:30,250
- Get down here! - Don't come over here!
- Don't touch me! - Don't stop me!

1928
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:32,870
- I told you guys to get down, do you hear me? - Don't move!

1929
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,370
What are you doing?

1930
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,250
Move back a bit!

1931
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:37,620
Hear that?
This is not your place.

1932
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,750
Hurry up!

1933
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:42,870
Why did you leave?

1934
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,210
- Where did Tieu Truong Duong go? - Aren't you scared?

1935
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
What are you doing?

1936
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:51,750
Back!

1937
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:53,120
Tieu Truong Duong!

1938
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,120
Didn't you say you wanted to fight?

1939
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:56,250
I'm right here!

1940
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:58,500
Why don't you dare accept the challenge?

1941
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,620
Who dares not fight,

1942
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:18,250
that guy is a rotten salted fish!

1943
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:40,370
Little Xiao!

1944
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:44,250
Don't blame me when you go to the hospital!

1945
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,500
You asked for it yourself!

1946
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,370
Just one round!

1947
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,750
I'll beat you until you can't get up!

1948
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,750
The original plaster will not work.

1949
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:16,870
Two or three minutes later it will turn into plaster.

1950
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,870
That's when it gets most dangerous.

1951
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,120
Must dodge its heavy punches!

1952
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:24,000
Does it leave out plaster?

1953
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,870
Definitely will quit.

1954
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,250
Because they can't lose!

1955
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,370
Follow our plan!

1956
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,370
Keep calm!

1957
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:04,500
For everyone!

1958
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:07,000
Also for yourself.

1959
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,000
KO it, A Quyen!

1960
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:12,870
A Quyen, keep it up!

1961
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,000
Get ready!

1962
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,500
Down!

1963
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:25,000
Okay!

1964
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:54,750
Come here!

1965
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,250
Just a little bit of courage?

1966
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:57,370
Come here!

1967
01:47:58,170 --> 01:47:59,210
Who is the salty fish?

1968
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,540
Come here!

1969
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:21,750
Today you can gather here,

1970
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,250
is just giving me some face!

1971
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:27,120
We have lost our reputation,

1972
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:28,620
lost to all the giang ho,

1973
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:31,000
nothing left to lose!

1974
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:32,870
But the living must have a mouth

1975
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:39,370
Do you want to regain some face with this kid?

1976
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,120
Damn it, I taught you Con Long Truu!

1977
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:43,870
You two old men watch and do it!

1978
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,370
The right to hit the ground where the buffalo is lying down!

1979
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,750
The elbow is the king of short strikes!

1980
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:56,120
Body like a coiled dragon (Body like a coiled dragon)!

1981
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:57,870
The elbow is like a sharp hammer!

1982
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,120
Wipe, sweep, smash, cover!

1983
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:01,870
Offense and defense combined!

1984
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,620
Cut mountains and break seas!

1985
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:07,000
My elbow

1986
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,000
Every man fights,

1987
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:18,120
face it head on,

1988
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:19,370
take the cavalry to win!

1989
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:22,250
Facing a strong enemy, you cannot fight head-on!

1990
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:24,120
Reality must turn into illusion,

1991
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,620
The virtual must become real.

1992
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,620
Avoid the real and beat the fake!

1993
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:32,620
This is the beauty of the mutual support of yin and yang!

1994
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,620
Acupuncture technique like thunder.

1995
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,750
A finger like thunder, ghosts and gods are all afraid!

1996
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:52,750
Power is not as good as palm!

1997
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:53,870
The palm is not as good as the finger!

1998
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,750
Martial arts techniques are varied.

1999
01:50:55,880 --> 01:51:00,870
Poke, pull, hook, grab!

2000
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,500
Press the wind meridian point!

2001
01:51:02,630 --> 01:51:07,000
Weigh the bones!

2002
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:08,620
But,

2003
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:11,370
what if i wear gloves?

2004
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:29,250
You must know that even if you learn all the tricks,

2005
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:30,620
under the rules of the ring,

2006
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,500
You are not his opponent either.

2007
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,620
So let's not forget what our goal is!

2008
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,370
Can you break a glove with just your elbow?

2009
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,370
In normal circumstances it is not possible.

2010
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,750
But,

2011
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:00,120
if there is plaster lining underneath then it is possible!

2012
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:03,500
Continue, continuous attack and defense! (continuous attack and defense)

2013
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:15,870
Laugh out loud and walk away!

2014
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,370
My life is not a grass-roots life!

2015
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:39,370
External training of tendons, bones and skin

2016
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:42,000
Practice one breath.

2017
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:44,250
Painting of the mouth

2018
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:48,500
See?

2019
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,620
What's behind this patch of weed?

2020
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,870
Can't see.

2021
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:56,870
What about you?

2022
01:54:57,630 --> 01:55:00,000
I see!

2023
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:03,370
A lion!

2024
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:57,370
Turn right!

2025
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:03,750
The gloves seem to be torn!

2026
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:05,620
Why are the crumbs falling out?

2027
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:09,500
It's plaster!

2028
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:11,250
It's cheating!

2029
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,500
It's like putting this in a glove!

2030
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:16,370
You guys watch!

2031
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,250
This kind of person is so shameless!

2032
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:20,080
Put plaster in and this glove will be hard!

2033
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:21,710
It's a scam, you don't even need face!

2034
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:23,250
Scammer!

2035
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:24,330
What invincible general!

2036
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,790
I spit!

2037
01:56:36,130 --> 01:56:37,250
No way!

2038
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:39,750
No way!

2039
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,370
You lose!

2040
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,750
I don't have!

2041
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,500
Dare to fight me for real?

2042
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:57,870
Teach him what real hard work is!

2043
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:06,500
Are you this kid's coach?

2044
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,000
Let's talk a bit.

2045
01:59:52,130 --> 01:59:54,330
News from our station, Kim Ham Martial Arts Club

2046
01:59:54,330 --> 01:59:56,500
for suspicion of cheating in the Cach Da Chi Da tournament,

2047
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:59,370
has been investigated by the authorities and has now temporarily suspended operations.

2048
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,000
Our station will continue to monitor the developments.

2049
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:37,620
Preservation and innovation are not easy.

2050
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:42,000
In you guys I see hope.

2051
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:49,250
We have so much negative news,

2052
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:50,870
aren't you worried?

2053
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,750
Let time tell.

2054
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:57,120
I believe that the upright will be vindicated.

2055
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,250
But I have a small request.

2056
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:08,120
When teaching boxing, you must also teach lion dance.

2057
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:14,750
We also have a request.

2058
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:16,120
Speak.
