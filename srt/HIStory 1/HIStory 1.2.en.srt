1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,900
History1

2
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:29,242
Luckily it was only a dream.

3
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,117
Get out of my way.

4
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,483
Fans are scarier than zombies.

5
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:49,617
Why are you running?

6
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:50,958
Then why are you running?

7
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,767
Can I not run?

8
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,875
Why are you being chased?

9
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,425
What do you think?

10
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:12,600
Are you Cheng Ching?

11
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,175
Are you?

12
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,317
It's really you.

13
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,650
So handsome.

14
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,317
Remember,

15
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:38,083
stay here.

16
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,900
Count to ten.

17
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:46,208
Cheng Ching.

18
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,792
Ah!

19
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,483
Hello, Mom.

20
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,400
Your new father and I

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,250
will travel around the world for a honeymoon.

22
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,250
During this period,

23
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,083
you have to take good care of your new brother.

24
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,059
He nearly dropped out of school.

25
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,491
You have to guide him in his homework

26
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:19,191
and take care of each other. Do you hear me?

27
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:20,259
Mom,

28
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,500
why didn't you tell me earlier that brother is coming?

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,442
He has lots of stuff.

30
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:26,517
That's it. Goodbye.

31
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:27,941
Hello?

32
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,908
Why is it him?

33
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,350
This must be an illusion.

34
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,133
This must be an illusion.

35
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,059
Hi.

36
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,050
How did you open the door?

37
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,208
Mom gave me the keys.

38
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,834
You should at least wear slippers.

39
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,050
Hey!

40
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,775
Take off my shoes?

41
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,150
Your taste is not bad at all.

42
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,208
Why don't you take off your shoes?

43
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,517
I actually have indoor slippers.

44
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,083
You can...

45
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,734
Now my father is married to your mother.

46
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,941
So we are brothers now.

47
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,050
Believe me.

48
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,750
I don't really like that either.

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,675
But for their happiness,

50
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:34,834
we must maintain good brotherhood

51
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:36,942
in front of them.

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,900
Another thing.

53
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:44,041
I must not drop out of school,

54
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,150
so you must teach me after school.

55
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,066
Do you understand?

56
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,525
Brother.

57
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,059
Is that how you ask people for help?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Alright, I understand.

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,866
Good.

60
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,166
All right.

61
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,733
You can open my luggage bag

62
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,433
and help me take out all the stuff.

63
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,417
Put things where they should be.

64
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,283
I will check when I return.

65
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,458
Hey.

66
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,250
Where are you going?

67
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,517
To work.

68
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:23,983
You have nine hours to arrange them.

69
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:25,442
Keep it up.

70
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:26,341
No...

71
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,808
I did not promise to help you arrange them.

72
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,917
Brother,

73
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,208
you do understand Chinese, don't you?

74
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,208
Let me tell you again.

75
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,783
It is

76
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,050
not a request.

77
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,859
It is an order.

78
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,000
[Is everything alright?]

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,417
[Be sure to get along well with your brother.]

80
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,634
You are outrageous.

81
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,542
Wake up.

82
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,617
It's annoying.

83
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,217
Where is he?

84
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,609
Are you looking for me?

85
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,383
That...

86
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:07,825
I meant to tell you,

87
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,709
you can stay at my place.

88
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,041
But we have to set up residential rules.

89
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,567
Residential rules?

90
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,375
First,

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,717
your clothes.

92
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:18,017
They shouldn't be scattered around like this.

93
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:18,583
Yesterday, I have already put them into the wardrobe for you.

94
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,542
Yesterday, I have already put them into the wardrobe for you.

95
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,150
Brother.

96
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,133
We need to get along well.

97
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,592
Oh.

98
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,917
About your mug...

99
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:34,959
You must wash it after using it.

100
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,709
That was a sweet beverage; you can't just put it there.

101
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,709
That was a sweet beverage; you can't just put it there.

102
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,191
Okay.

103
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,083
I understand.

104
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,783
But I can't do it.

105
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,083
Who is your younger brother?

106
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,467
That artist, Cheng Ching.

107
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,450
Are you serious?

108
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,908
That Cheng Ching?

109
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,783
So now you are brothers?

110
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:04,267
I'm telling you the truth.

111
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:09,000
This is literally the most fantastic BL (boys love) coupling ever.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,833
I am so happy.

113
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,208
What are you happy about?

114
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,966
You don't even know how troublesome he is.

115
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,617
Then…

116
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,892
Last night, did you guys...

117
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,717
We slept last night.

118
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:25,625
You slept?

119
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:44,917
Enough.

120
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:45,809
Fu Meng Meng,

121
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,583
stop making wild imaginations anymore.

122
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,125
Does it matter?

123
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,500
You can't see them anyway.

124
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,250
You guys are just like Jung Won and Hwa Shin.

125
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,917
Terrific match.

126
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:56,642
Jung Won and...

127
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,609
Should it be Cheng Ching, Cheng Ching CP or Ho Cheng CP?

128
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,817
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

129
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,475
It's...

130
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:10,817
It's Cheng Ching.

131
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,375
Why are you back so early?

132
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,291
I got off work early, so I came back early.

133
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,000
Brother, is she your friend?

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,266
Hello.

135
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,433
I am Meng Meng.

136
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:23,000
Hello.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,317
I am Cheng Ching.

138
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:25,725
A bossy top...

139
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,917
live action!

140
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,375
Meng Meng, you should go home now.

141
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,559
So handsome.

142
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,108
Go now, go now.

143
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:36,191
It's still early.

144
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,000
Go now, Fu Meng Meng.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,966
Cheng Ching, remember that I am Meng Meng.

146
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,100
Hey, kindly inform me next time

147
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,150
if you're bringing someone home, okay?

148
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,266
I'm not putting on a smiling face off work,

149
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,783
it's exhausting.

150
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,450
So this is the real you.

151
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,442
It was disgusting when you smiled like that this afternoon.

152
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,275
Whatever.

153
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:13,050
What are you doing?

154
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,317
Go get yours yourself.

155
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,017
Show some love, Brother.

156
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,775
So you artists are all like this.

157
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:25,817
Aren't you afraid that I could expose you?

158
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,025
Go ahead.

159
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,317
As if they'd believe you.

160
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,083
Hey, Hsiao Ming.

161
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,091
How's that case going?

162
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,509
It didn't work out?

163
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,133
Alright, I see.

164
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,317
Sorry to trouble you, Hsiao Ming.

165
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:53,959
Okay.

166
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,308
Thank you.

167
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,966
Goodbye.

168
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:11,800
If the case is off, you should attend classes more often.

169
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,975
Since you're this close to getting dropped out of school.

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
So you care about me now.

171
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,350
Oh.

172
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,600
How nice to have a brother's love.

173
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,409
Then I will sleep on the bed tonight.

174
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,634
Are you joking?

175
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:28,583
Do I look like I am joking? I am serious.

176
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,400
Do I look like I am joking? I am serious.

177
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,841
Sleep on the sofa like yesterday.

178
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,483
That sofa is too small. It's not mean for people to sleep on it!

179
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:42,300
Come on.

180
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,233
No.

181
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,233
I got it.

182
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,050
Are you afraid that

183
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,166
if you sleep in the same bed with me, you would...

184
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,583
if you sleep in the same bed with me, you would...

185
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,125
get pregnant?

186
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,417
Nonsense.

187
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,458
I am used to sleeping alone.

188
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,241
Habits can be changed.

189
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:06,517
I changed so many habits after moving in with you.

190
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:07,183
That's it, I want to sleep on the bed tonight.

191
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,166
That's it, I want to sleep on the bed tonight.

192
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,291
Aren't you going to finish?

193
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,592
Up to you.

194
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:44,917
Hey.

195
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,000
These are the notes given by Professor Chen last week.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,925
They should cover the midterm examination.

197
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,125
Take a look.

198
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,208
Handwritten notes are on the back.

199
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,792
Hey.

200
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,567
I can't do that now.

201
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,667
I have to read the script.

202
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,483
Wake me up at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

203
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,417
I have to attend a required course. I can't be late.

204
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,750
I have to attend a required course. I can't be late.

205
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,442
Can't you set the alarm clock?

206
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:11,542
If the alarm clock would work,

207
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,734
why would I ask you to wake me up?

208
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,392
Fine,

209
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:24,509
just oversleep then.

210
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,117
Brother,

211
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,675
take away these notes.

212
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,750
Don't you ever study these.

213
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,217
Finally going to bed now?

214
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,758
Be sure to cover yourself

215
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,050
or you would catch a cold.

216
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,150
It's better

217
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,050
like this.

218
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,375
You... Why are you lying on top of me?

219
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,525
You... Why are you lying on top of me?

220
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,925
Let me sleep for another minute.

221
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,450
It's already 7 a.m. Aren't you going to school?

222
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,542
It's already 7 a.m. Aren't you going to school?

223
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,250
Three more minutes.

224
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,900
Wake up.

225
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,275
Wake up!

226
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,183
Am I going to be an aunt?

227
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,809
Or a godmother?

228
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,017
Tell me every little detail.

229
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,775
Seriously?

230
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:11,567
Who wants this kind of brother?

231
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,983
What kind of brother?

232
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,108
A cunning top?

233
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,542
A proud top

234
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,783
or a definite top?

235
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,442
Fu Meng Meng

236
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:22,759
This fella must be a two-faced and a rogue.

237
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,959
This fella must be a two-faced and a rogue.

238
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,917
He must have come from another planet.

239
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,734
You mean like Do Min Zun?

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,775
It's all my mother's fault.

241
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,217
She's happily in love

242
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:38,200
but left me tons of trouble.

243
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,058
It's Cheng Ching we're talking about.

244
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,208
People would kill to be in your place.

245
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,775
How is that possible.

246
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:46,867
So...

247
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,525
From tomorrow onwards,

248
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:51,208
can I go to your place every day?

249
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,191
Cheng Ching,

250
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:00,542
can you sign for me?

251
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:01,542
It's Cheng Ching.

252
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,483
Alright then.

253
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,442
I also want your signature.

254
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:05,909
You are so handsome.

255
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,442
Thank you.

256
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,492
Thank you.

257
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:15,975
Alright, we will start our lesson now.

258
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:18,041
Alright, we will start our lesson now.

259
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,350
Okay, please turn to page 48.

260
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,983
Okay, please turn to page 48.

261
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,550
If you keep acting absent-minded in class like today,

262
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,783
you will not pass the examination.

263
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,909
Since it's a new semester,

264
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,508
you should study harder.

265
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,291
Take things seriously.

266
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,508
Did you hear me?

267
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,291
Alright, I got it.

268
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,909
Did you understand what I said?

269
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:21,542
Yes. Can you just eat first?

270
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,092
Yes. Can you just eat first?

271
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,083
The food is getting cold.

272
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,025
I will have them if you don't want to.

273
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,391
Hey!

274
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,983
They have their own names?

275
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:28,700
Of course.

276
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,275
So you're that boring person

277
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:35,017
who names all his fish.

278
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,000
How is it boring?

279
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,734
They are so adorable.

280
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,775
Quite boring.

281
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:44,966
What is its name?

282
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:46,375
This one?

283
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,650
Yes.

284
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,917
Red.

285
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,275
Red?

286
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,325
Red.

287
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,350
It's black but you call it Red?

288
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:58,333
Its tail is red.

289
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,075
No, its tail is black.

290
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,709
Which one are you looking at?

291
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:05,983
That one.

292
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,125
The one behind the water grass now?

293
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,509
Yes.

294
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,625
Yes.

295
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,866
Red.

296
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,533
Forget it.

297
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:14,700
Have they eaten?

298
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:15,875
Not yet. I feed them before going to bed.

299
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,792
Not yet. I feed them before going to bed.

300
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,358
Give me the fodder.

301
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:20,366
You want to feed them?

302
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:20,934
Yes. I haven't fed fish before.

303
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,700
Yes. I haven't fed fish before.

304
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,191
Don't pour too much.

305
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,634
They are still young.

306
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,217
Hey.

307
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:34,233
Hey.

308
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,275
How do you answer this question?

309
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,492
This one

310
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:11,659
is actually the same as Question 3.

311
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:13,092
It involves

312
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,650
an opposite context.

313
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,200
You have to do it in the opposite way.

314
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
So,

315
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,358
try solving this question with that logic.

316
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,383
It's actually the same.

317
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,734
Okay.

318
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,875
Use the same formula,

319
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,617
it works.

320
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,542
Please don't do this to me anymore.

321
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,659
We have broken up.

322
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,375
Even if we have broken up,

323
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,309
I can still care for you.

324
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,000
What's the difference with breaking up...

325
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,759
What's the difference with not breaking up?

326
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,625
You really suck at arguing.

327
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,858
That's not true.

328
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,775
Pick another scene.

329
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,108
Are you sure?

330
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:22,041
Yes.

331
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,675
Fine, how about this scene?

332
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,375
This one?

333
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:30,091
Can you do it?

334
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,542
Aren't you a smart student?

335
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,275
It's taking you too long.

336
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,050
Let's do it.

337
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,317
Okay. Alright.

338
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:43,483
Ready?

339
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,991
Ching,

340
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,575
I can't let Tony snatch you away.

341
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,817
Actually, Tony and I...

342
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,091
Did you really think that I would kiss you?

343
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:11,742
There's... There are more lines on the back.

344
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,792
There's... There are more lines on the back.

345
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,250
Don't be so serious during rehearsal.

346
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,634
This is only a rehearsal.

347
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:18,875
Oh.

348
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,658
So, was it good for your practice?

349
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:24,091
No.

350
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,108
Hey.

351
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,166
Hey.

352
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,241
Are you angry?

353
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,375
Why are you angry?

354
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,625
Your acting is really poor.

355
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,550
I wonder how far they are now.

356
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,483
just another minute, and then we should go home.

357
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:02,375
Alright.

358
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,083
Why are we going home so early?

359
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:08,333
There are many things to do at home.

360
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,983
You have a test tomorrow.

361
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,775
Have you studied?

362
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,625
Let me ask you.

363
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:16,792
Is studying so important to you?

364
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,692
Is studying so important to you?

365
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,150
Of course.

366
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,325
If I study hard,

367
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:26,709
I can go to a good university.

368
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,542
After graduation,

369
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,925
I can get a good job.

370
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:33,225
So I will have stable income

371
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:34,775
and a stable life.

372
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:36,575
Isn't that great?

373
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,600
I can't say you're wrong.

374
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,859
But you see,

375
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,358
I am now acting

376
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:43,700
and singing.

377
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:45,566
My dreams have already come true.

378
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:47,842
And the point is that I am happy every day.

379
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:49,041
As for the stable life

380
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,208
you mentioned,

381
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,108
I believe I can do better than you.

382
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:57,717
Great.

383
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,741
I'm telling you,

384
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,692
you are so much like my father.

385
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:04,625
He also thinks that

386
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,834
nothing is more important than studying.

387
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,417
But don't you think that life is short?

388
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:12,442
We should spend more time to pursue our dreams.

389
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:14,091
Like him,

390
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:15,166
although he was good at studying and had a good job

391
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,108
although he was good at studying and had a good job

392
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:17,692
and a good income,

393
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:18,892
he was single for a long time.

394
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,400
He didn't found his true happiness

395
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,208
when he met your mother.

396
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,508
So in my opinion,

397
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,191
you can't be good at just studying.

398
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,409
Do you understand?

399
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,983
I am going home now.

400
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:35,609
Hey.

401
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,592
Let's go home later.

402
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:39,775
I don't know how to do this.

403
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:41,242
Your turn.

404
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:42,283
Me?

405
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,625
Hurry.

406
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,792
Let me teach you.

407
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:45,659
I can't.

408
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:46,450
Don't be a coward.

409
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,191
Quick.

410
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:48,817
Hold me tight.

411
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:50,425
Fine.

412
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,108
Just step on it?

413
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:51,600
Yes. Step on it.

414
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,442
Yes. Step on it.

415
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:59,358
And then?

416
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,008
Move your body forward.

417
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,609
Give me your hand.

418
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,483
Not bad.

419
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:11,283
You are talented.

420
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,342
So,

421
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:16,408
my sense of balance

422
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,900
is not bad, right?

423
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,959
Fine,

424
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,517
you have a little bit of sporting talent.

425
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,817
Be careful.

426
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:27,917
Okay,

427
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,642
I have to get down.

428
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:34,734
Alright, I want to go home now.

429
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:37,900
Wait for me.

430
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:55,917
Hey.

431
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,659
Is Meng Meng your girlfriend?

432
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,259
No way!

433
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,510
We've known each other since secondary school.

434
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:08,750
She's like a sister to me.

435
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,675
Really?

436
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,709
How are you

437
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:21,975
and your father lately?

438
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,683
Still the same.

439
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,175
Why would you suddenly ask about him?

440
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,092
Nothing.

441
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:33,600
My mother,

442
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,300
who is also your mother,

443
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,950
wants us to take care of each other.

444
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,250
For artists like you,

445
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,542
are you tired when shooting?

446
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,483
Sort of.

447
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:56,234
I think it's because

448
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,283
I already got used to it.

449
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,683
It's nothing.

450
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,367
Is it fun?

451
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,308
Fun?

452
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:08,708
It's quite fun sometimes.

453
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,991
But it can also be boring sometimes.

454
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:19,450
What are you up to lately?

455
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,275
Actually,

456
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,941
there's a film I really want to join.

457
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:30,125
I like the role a lot,

458
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,934
and the crew.

459
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,391
I like everything about it.

460
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:34,917
However,

461
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:37,325
I will have to leave Taiwan for a while.

462
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
So that's a no.

463
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,108
It sounds good.

464
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,875
Leave for a while...

465
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,583
That's nice.

466
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,133
Who are the actors?

467
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,108
Why did you pour so much?

468
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:05,191
I thought you should have more.

469
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,550
Let me do it.

470
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,017
A He.

471
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:39,825
My story has reached four hundred thousand clicks.

472
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,608
A He.

473
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,708
A He.

474
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,975
A He.

475
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,075
You're not listening to me.

476
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,391
I'm just not in the mood.

477
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,242
How can a person have so many bad habits?

478
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,075
And then?

479
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,041
And then...

480
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,108
This person doesn't close the door

481
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:16,333
nor switch on the light when he goes to the toilet at night.

482
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,700
He keeps scaring me.

483
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,208
He doesn't even put on clothes after taking a shower

484
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,142
and he throws his towel everywhere.

485
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,325
I just don't get him.

486
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:30,417
Oh my!

487
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,366
The story of you two are really amazing.

488
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:35,783
It's literally novel material.

489
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,475
Do you need a maid?

490
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:39,500
I want to apply.

491
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,983
Hire me, hire me.

492
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:46,834
He studies at our school?

493
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,709
I saw him at school today.

494
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:49,875
How is it possible?

495
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:50,875
Really.

496
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,959
I really saw him at the school.

497
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:52,917
Did you really see him?

498
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,000
I really saw him.

499
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,609
Look!

500
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:58,850
Cheng Ching.

501
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,709
Can I take a photo with you?

502
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:01,366
I'm sorry. It's not a good time.

503
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:03,208
I'm sorry. It's not a good time.

504
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,083
But we rarely see a superstar at school.

505
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,041
It doesn't take long for a photo.

506
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,591
Come on, it's just a photo.

507
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,208
She likes you.

508
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,217
I'm really sorry.

509
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,575
Why are you being so arrogant?

510
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,458
Enough.

511
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,150
This is a school. I just want to be a student.

512
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,925
This is a school. I just want to be a student.

513
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,709
Let's take a photo.

514
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:19,483
We're all in the same school.

515
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:20,959
Let's take a photo.

516
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,942
What are you doing?

517
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:23,942
I'm sorry.

518
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,066
We are late for class.

519
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,875
The super idol is hitting someone.

520
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,125
You run away after hitting someone?

521
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,025
Chang Yang.

522
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:33,917
Let's go.

523
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,859
Stop.

524
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,709
Chang Yang.

525
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,742
Enough.

526
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,783
It's nothing.

527
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:54,108
Why did you get into a fight with others at the university?

528
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:56,225
You saw that!

529
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,458
They started the whole thing.

530
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:01,025
Can't you just keep a low profile?

531
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,042
It's not that I don't want to.

532
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:06,108
That is not how you keep a low profile.

533
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:07,900
In school...

534
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,400
I understand what you are saying

535
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,409
and I'm trying.

536
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,509
But it's just so hard.

537
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:25,091
I am tired.

538
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,625
Can we go home now?

539
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,600
From tomorrow onward, you don't have to set the alarm.

540
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,125
I will wake you up.

541
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,550
Alright.

542
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,917
Hello?

543
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,050
A He.

544
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,208
I bought breakfast for you.

545
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,967
I will bring it to you now.

546
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:06,600
There's no need. Give it to me when we meet later.

547
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,525
There's no need. Give it to me when we meet later.

548
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:09,783
It's still early.

549
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:10,325
Besides, I got you your favorite, rice roll.

550
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,350
Besides, I got you your favorite, rice roll.

551
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,025
I don't think it's a great idea.

552
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:15,050
Or...

553
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,158
Let me ask Cheng Ching later.

554
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,917
Ask me about what?

555
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:22,567
Meng Meng said, she's bringing breakfast to our place.

556
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:23,750
Meng Meng said, she's bringing breakfast to our place.

557
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:26,708
That's great.

558
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,734
I am hungry now.

559
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,667
Wake me up when she's here.

560
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,517
I will sleep for a while.

561
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,583
Cheng Ching, this is for you.

562
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,625
Cheng Ching, this is for you.

563
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,091
Thank you.

564
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,917
This rice roll is awesome.

565
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,517
This is A He's favorite.

566
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:58,050
He can eat that everyday for a month.

567
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:58,750
Really?

568
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,325
Yes.

569
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,891
It's really delicious.

570
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,717
Finish your food.

571
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,050
We are leaving soon.

572
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,600
Oh.

573
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,750
Where are you guys going?

574
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,175
We're going shopping and watching a movie

575
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:08,317
and having some fresh air.

576
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:09,550
Sounds interesting.

577
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,308
Count me in.

578
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:10,917
Great.

579
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:12,125
Nope.

580
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,883
- Why?
- Why?

581
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,550
Going outwith a superstar is dangerous.

582
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,317
Far from it.

583
00:36:19,317 --> 00:36:20,341
No worries.

584
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:22,291
Lend me your clothes then.

585
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:24,000
No one would notice me in your outfit.

586
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,734
My outfit...

587
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,041
Don't worry.

588
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,250
I don't think it's a great idea.

589
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:29,834
- It's fine.
- Can I help you?

590
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,875
- It's fine.
- Can I help you?

591
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,091
Let me help you.

592
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:49,200
Do you need my help?

593
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,583
There's so much food.

594
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:06,783
There are grapes.

595
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:07,850
Yes.

596
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,991
I bought them this morning.

597
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:11,100
Try some.

598
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,650
Hey,

599
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,650
were you bored joining us today?

600
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,650
were you bored joining us today?

601
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,750
Not really.

602
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,941
I think it's fun.

603
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,041
What's the most important is that

604
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,458
I feel relaxed and free.

605
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,417
That's great.

606
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:29,750
Which means A He's outfits are so...

607
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,567
Look,

608
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:55,650
these are the photos I took just now.

609
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,834
You guys were wild on the swing.

610
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,075
So wild.

611
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:58,600
Yes. I almost fell down.

612
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,558
Yes. I almost fell down.

613
00:37:59,558 --> 00:38:01,734
Why did you take ugly photos of me?

614
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:04,450
You are still very handsome.

615
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,358
- Are there photos of me?
- No.

616
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:07,917
- Are there photos of me?
- No.

617
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:08,683
Why would there be photos of you?

618
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:09,583
You were sitting here all the time

619
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,617
excluding us.

620
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:11,350
He's right.

621
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,383
You didn't care to have fun with us.

622
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:15,100
I was preparing food for us.

623
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,008
So sweet.

624
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,234
Not bad.

625
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:19,483
Keep it up.

626
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:20,900
So,

627
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,675
take a photo of me.

628
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,550
No need at all.

629
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,175
You are not photogenic at all.

630
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:27,458
Don't waste the memory card.

631
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,883
Let me take a photo of both of you.

632
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:30,058
Is that alright?

633
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,550
But,

634
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,017
I don't want to.

635
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:35,183
Why?

636
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,208
- Just joking.
- Come on.

637
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,134
Come on.

638
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:40,208
I changed my mind.

639
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,500
Hey, are you angry?

640
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,091
Hey, are you angry?

641
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:44,375
Hey, what are you angry about?

642
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,667
Hey, what are you angry about?

643
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:46,667
Hey,

644
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,325
what are you angry about?

645
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,050
Hey.

646
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,083
Hey.

647
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:50,883
Hey.

648
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:54,400
Why are you bullying A He?

649
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,458
Because he is throwing a tamtrum.

650
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,291
Okay.

651
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:59,358
Is this our breakfast?

652
00:39:01,483 --> 00:39:02,583
I didn't have time to buy breakfast today.

653
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,783
Pick one.

654
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:07,158
I want the super yummy rice rolls.

655
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,000
Try and keep your personal belongings.

656
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,517
Try and keep your personal belongings.

657
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,300
I will do it in a while.

658
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,583
We are running late.

659
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,750
Hey,

660
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,375
aren't you tired of studying so late every day?

661
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:00,591
Not really.

662
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:01,991
I am already used to it.

663
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,350
I can't stand it.

664
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,825
You are good.

665
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,208
Follow my instruction and do it accordingly.

666
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,500
Got my idea?

667
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:37,975
Alright. Take a break then.

668
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:38,875
Alright. Take a break then.

669
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,675
Thank you.

670
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:41,817
Excuse me, Director.

671
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,717

00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,125
I know.

685
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,741
But it's nice.

686
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,500
Have you had dinner?

687
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,917
Nope. I just got off work.

688
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,208
Nope. I just got off work.

689
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,817
How about you?

690
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:23,583
I am not hungry yet.

691
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,883
Really?

692
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,041
Let me heat up the food.

693
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:38,075
This looks great.

694
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:40,225
Did you prepare all of this yourself?

695
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,600
Not all of it.

696
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,083
So you haven't eaten at all?

697
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,291
Or were you waiting for me?

698
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,667
It's pouring.

699
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,317
Here you go.

700
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:19,308
What is this?

701
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:21,383
It's for Cheng Ching.

702
00:43:21,383 --> 00:43:23,317
For Cheng Ching?

703
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:25,750
You aren't allowed to open that.

704
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,834
You're falling in love with Cheng Ching?

705
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:28,575
Why didn't I notice that?

706
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,117
There's no such thing as proper timing

707
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,550
when it comes to love.

708
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,967
For real?

709
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:39,350
Yes.

710
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,308
I can't do this. Give it to him yourself.

711
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:45,941
I can't do this. Give it to him yourself.

712
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:49,000
Please.

713
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,325
I'd be really sad

714
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:52,483
if you won't do me the favor.

715
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:53,983
You're exaggerating.

716
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,450
I'm not.

717
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,400
Alright.

718
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,458
I'll do you the favor.

719
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,125
Really?

720
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,983
You are still the best.

721
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:04,725
Then... I need to go to class now.

722
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,925
Then... I need to go to class now.

723
00:44:05,925 --> 00:44:07,517
Bye.

724
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:17,008
A gift?

725
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:20,000
Is it for me?

726
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,650
Who is this from?

727
00:44:23,225 --> 00:44:25,358
Take a look yourself.

728
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:26,475
Oh.

729
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,941
Seriously?

730
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,500
What?

731
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:44,150
Are you joking or playing with me?

732
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,050
Are you joking or playing with me?

733
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,458
What? Are you delusional?

734
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,417
What? Are you delusional?

735
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,250
She showed her sincerity to you.

736
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,925
Don't be so rude.

737
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,625
Fine.

738
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,767
Fine what?

739
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:03,600
Let's date.

740
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,750
Maybe you should think it over.

741
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,317
You don't really have to...

742
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,883
What are you doing?

743
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:15,650
Not enough?

744
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,825
What the heck are you doing?

745
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,217
Why are you angry?

746
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,017
Is it going too fast for you?

747
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:29,575
Meng Meng just confessed to you.

748
00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:31,083
Why did you kiss me then?

749
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:33,750
What does your confession to me have to do with Meng Meng?

750
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,400
What did you say?

751
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:42,775
You wrote this yourself.

752
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,650
We are here.

753
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,450
Aren't you getting off?

754
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:17,025
So what are we now?

755
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:19,050
Don't you have anything to say to me?

756
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:23,750
So, are you angry with me

757
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,875
So, are you angry with me

758
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,717
because I kissed you?

759
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,650
You are running late.

760
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,875
Anyone would get the wrong idea

761
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,750
after reading that letter.

762
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,583
Even if it's a misunderstanding,

763
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:39,017
it doesn't mean you can kiss anyone just like that.

764
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,383
So I'm easy to you.

765
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,741
I didn't mean it that way.

766
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,075
I only kissed you

767
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,041
because I like you.

768
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,425
We're brothers.

769
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:00,317
We're not related.

770
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,625
What if mom and dad find out?

771
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:05,300
What does this have to do with mom and dad?

772
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,350
What matters is you and me.

773
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:10,375
Tell me,

774
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:12,183
do you like me?

775
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,167
I don't want to be in a relationship.

776
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,950
Definitely not with you.

777
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,067
What are you afraid of?

778
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,450
I'm serious.

779
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,158
I can't accept it.

780
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,190
You are the first one that treated me well.

781
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,520
You are the first one that treated me well.

782
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,960
Think about it. You don't need to rush to give me an answer.

783
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,080
Sorry. I'm late.

784
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,750
I kissed you

785
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,530
because I love you.

786
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,910
We are brothers.

787
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,630
We are not related.

788
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,330
What are you afraid of? I'm serious.

789
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:17,050
I can't accept it.

790
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,909
How was your confession yesterday?

791
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,442
Did he say yes to you?

792
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:31,333
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

793
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,875
Stay away from me.

794
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,525
If you don't tell me,

795
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:36,391
I'll go ask Cheng Ching myself.

796
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:38,159
Ask me what?

797
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,758
So today...

798
00:50:40,758 --> 00:50:43,141
you're going with the Weak Seme style.

799
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,634
So handsome.

800
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:48,941
I thought I kept a low profile today.

801
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:51,950
Hmm...

802
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,366
Cheng Ching,

803
00:50:53,366 --> 00:50:56,683
did something happen between you two yesterday?

804
00:50:56,683 --> 00:50:57,575
I asked A He,

805
00:50:57,575 --> 00:50:58,591
but he wouldn't tell me.

806
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:00,725
Can you tell me instead?

807
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:01,258
Yesterday?

808
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,292
Yes.

809
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:04,500
No. Nothing happened.

810
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,159
No. Nothing happened.

811
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:06,475
Same as usual.

812
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:08,925
How come?

813
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:31,133
Something must have happened.

814
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:39,058
A He, here.

815
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:46,141
What happened to him?

816
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:47,491
I don't know.

817
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,825
What happened to the both of you yesterday?

818
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:53,875
Silence, class.

819
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:04,391
Sir.

820
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:06,250
Yes?

821
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:06,967
Excuse me, which chapter are we on at the moment?

822
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:09,700
Excuse me, which chapter are we on at the moment?

823
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,391
Chapter 5.

824
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,625
Thank you, Sir.

825
00:52:20,075 --> 00:52:23,609
Feng He, can we talk?

826
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,083
What did you guys order?

827
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,059
I don't know.

828
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:07,000
A He hasn't ordered yet.

829
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:18,867
What would you like?

830
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:25,317
I'm not hungry.

831
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:34,125
What should we do?

832
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:49,266
Aren't you going to tell me

833
00:53:49,266 --> 00:53:51,425
what really happened?

834
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:06,234
Feng, I don't know how to solve this.

835
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:08,025
Can you teach me?

836
00:54:14,241 --> 00:54:16,425
I have taught you many times.

837
00:54:17,325 --> 00:54:19,491
If you're still having trouble solving it,

838
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:21,709
I suggest that you skip it for later

839
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:25,025
so that you won't waste your time.

840
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:27,383
Waste time?

841
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,417
So you think that time with me

842
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:32,825
is a waste?

843
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,792
I didn't mean it that way.

844
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,541
Don't be like this all the time.

845
00:54:40,283 --> 00:54:42,700
I think I have worked hard enough

846
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,083
doing what an older brother should do.

847
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:46,617
Older brother?

848
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,500
You know I don't want an older brother.

849
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,025
Can you stop lying to yourself?

850
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,550
We are family.

851
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,325
Family?

852
00:54:59,325 --> 00:55:01,400
Then why did you sleep on the sofa last night?

853
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:05,283
Do you have any idea what I really want?

854
00:55:10,075 --> 00:55:12,759
I see you like a younger brother.

855
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:15,575
That's all.

856
00:55:19,825 --> 00:55:21,700
Fine, it's okay.

857
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:25,734
Let me ask you one last time.

858
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:32,592
Don't you have any feelings about me?

859
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,859
What feelings?

860
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:48,025
Don't you have the same feelings I have for you?

861
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:04,742
Fine, I'll stay away from you.

862
00:58:48,867 --> 00:58:50,567
What do you want?

863
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:52,758
Um...

864
00:58:52,758 --> 00:58:54,767
Cheng Ching.

865
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:58,641
The love letter Feng He gave you the other day...

866
00:58:58,641 --> 00:59:00,900
I wrote that.

867
00:59:02,059 --> 00:59:04,017
I'm sorry.

868
00:59:04,017 --> 00:59:05,241
Don't get mad

869
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,250
and please don't blame him.

870
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,225
I don't want him to sad.

871
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:13,691
He's lucky

872
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:15,625
to have you as a friend.

873
00:59:17,325 --> 00:59:19,700
But there are certain things

874
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,150
that both of us can't change.

875
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,000
So you don't need to worry about that.

876
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,500
Then,

877
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:29,183
I wish you all the best at work.

878
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:30,809
Thank you.

879
00:59:45,117 --> 00:59:46,883
You may start now.

880
00:59:58,792 --> 00:59:59,291
Excuse me, Sir? I'm late.

881
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,125
Excuse me, Sir? I'm late.

882
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,850
Thank you.

883
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,483
A He.

884
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,808
I'm sorry.

885
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,525
Why did you do that?

886
01:02:06,825 --> 01:02:09,375
I didn't do it on purpose.

887
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:16,959
I'm really sorry.

888
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:21,375
I really didn't expect things to turn out like this.

889
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:29,925
Will you forgive me?

890
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,958
You suck.

891
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,825
It's like this.

892
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:01,758
Yes.

893
01:03:01,758 --> 01:03:03,741
I really can't do this.

894
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:05,908
You are the best.

895
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:11,192
Let's go.

896
01:03:11,192 --> 01:03:12,550
Alright.

897
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:16,459
Let's go.

898
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,442
Brother,

899
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:47,283
let's get along well.

900
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:16,600
Don't you have any feelings about me?

901
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:20,125
We're not related.

902
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,250
I only kissed you

903
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,700
because I like you.

904
01:04:27,183 --> 01:04:28,750
We're brothers.

905
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,959
If this is what you want,

906
01:04:34,491 --> 01:04:36,558
I'll stay away from you.

907
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:18,850
[Feng He]

908
01:05:25,517 --> 01:05:28,092
The professor didn't flunk me.

909
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:29,183
What about other subjects?

910
01:05:29,183 --> 01:05:30,775
Let me check.

911
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,225
What?

912
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:45,734
I passed all my subjects.

913
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,483
Did you pass yours?

914
01:05:48,483 --> 01:05:50,059
Yes.

915
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:12,283
How is work?

916
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:13,934
How is work?

917
01:07:14,992 --> 01:07:16,625
Same as usual.

918
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,283
You...

919
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,291
Why are you here?

920
01:07:28,658 --> 01:07:29,766
Um...

921
01:07:30,308 --> 01:07:31,608
Congratulations.

922
01:07:31,608 --> 01:07:33,409
You have passed all exams.

923
01:07:35,366 --> 01:07:36,967
Piece of cake.

924
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:38,491
And you?

925
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:40,508
You must have passed all your subjects.

926
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,558
Why are you smiling?

927
01:07:55,491 --> 01:07:57,308
I'm just happy

928
01:07:57,308 --> 01:07:59,600
that I get to see you.

929
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,892
I miss you so much.

930
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:13,859
I have thought it over.

931
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:16,242
Habits can be changed.

932
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:30,300
Let's live together.
