1
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,033
Do you know what reborn means?

2
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,433
It means getting another life

3
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,033
in addition to the one you already have.

4
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,967
I am getting married to Yi Jun.

5
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,800
Why?

6
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,033
Why?

7
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,766
Hold me.

8
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,434
Please hold me.

9
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,933
You said

10
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,233
you would hold me

11
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:53,233
and never let go.

12
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:59,233
That is what you said.

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,166
Actually, I...

14
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,233
I died once.

15
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,933
On September 19, 2025,

16
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:53,300
that is the 9th anniversary day when I met Jiang Jing Teng.

17
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,500
Yi Jun and I

18
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,100
are getting married.

19
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,600
And after he betrayed me,

20
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,133
I was killed in a car accident

21
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,534
not knowing the reason why.

22
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,467
I want to be

23
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,500
your one and only.

24
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,233
I

25
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,367
am reborn,

26
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,666
and I'm back to nine years ago.

27
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,033
I don't know

28
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,700
why I can go back to this time of life

29
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,833
to live it again.

30
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,567
But this time,

31
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,233
I want it to be the way I want.

32
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:07,533
I'll never let Jiang Jing Teng hurt me again.

33
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,233
Jiang Jing Teng.

34
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,700
I wouldn't be truly reborn

35
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,333
until I don't see you in school today.

36
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,100
I want to change destiny and

37
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,000
create my own

38
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,200
exciting life.

39
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Shao Yi Chen.

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,867
Are you ready?

41
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,900
Coming!

42
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,467
This is not the excitement I wanted!

43
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:40,367
Mu Bai.

44
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,633
Let's split up.

45
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,533
I don't want to.

46
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,900
They will only go after me.

47
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,533
Friends should always stick together through thick and thin!

48
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,100
Loyalty is everything.

49
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,500
We don't even know you.

50
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,266
Our meeting is destiny.

51
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't be so heartless.

52
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,233
I hate myself.

53
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,634
You getting beaten is none of my business.

54
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,833
Why did I stop and ask you if you're okay?

55
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,000
I know.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,900
I hate myself too.

57
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,067
Being this handsome is a curse.

58
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:15,567
Turns out the girl I hit on yesterday

59
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,367
already has a boyfriend.

60
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,467
Why did you hit on another man's girlfriend?

61
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,467
Do you not have any morals?

62
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:24,900
They found us. Run!

63
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,367
They found us. Run!

64
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,033
Carry me.

65
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:31,333
Here is your breakfast, Jiang Jing Teng.

66
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:33,667
I didn't ask you to get me breakfast.

67
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:34,367
But I wanted to. Take it.

68
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:35,933
But I wanted to. Take it.

69
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,266
You damn assholes.

70
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,467
- Stop running.
- Stop!

71
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,800
Crime is really getting worse these days.

72
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,300
I have to go.

73
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,166
Jiang Jing Teng, take it.

74
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,533
Jiang Jing Teng, take it.

75
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:48,734
Quick.

76
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,567
Quick.

77
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,266
Quick.

78
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,034
Here.

79
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:54,867
We should be

80
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:57,233
okay here.

81
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,100
Hey.

82
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,800
Hey.

83
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,166
Hey.

84
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,100
The gate is over there.

85
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,367
You really don't know the campus,

86
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,400
are you freshmen?

87
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
Hey.

88
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,100
Hey.

89
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,633
You can not give up halfway when saving someone.

90
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,667
You better not let me catch you.

91
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,667
Hey!

92
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,100
What are you doing?

93
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,000
You spent two years writing that stupid fan diary.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
From now on,

95
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,433
I have no strings attached

96
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02,600
I have no strings attached

97
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,400
to this guy.

98
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,967
There was no such strings.

99
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,200
He's just a senior in school.

100
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,967
When we were freshmen in high school, he was a senior.

101
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,867
When we were freshmen in high school, he was a senior.

102
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,833
But...

103
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,633
Why are you looking at me like that?

104
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:18,834
After you fainted last month

105
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,166
and stopped breathing,

106
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,100
you have been acting weird

107
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,200
since the doctors saved your life.

108
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,433
Weird?

109
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,000
Weird how?

110
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,533
Take these diaries for example.

111
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,433
You used to value them more than your own life.

112
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,366
When we were juniors,

113
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,133
you got into fights because of the diaries.

114
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,600
Now you burn them without a second thought.

115
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,433
Let us just say I am too old for it now,

116
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:40,266
okay?

117
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:42,300
That is really random.

118
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,834
You are annoying.

119
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,333
Just hurry up and help.

120
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,667
If the sweet potatoes are still raw,

121
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,433
it's going to be your fault.

122
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,667
This is like burning ghost money.

123
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,466
It is gone.

124
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:01,367
My praise worthy youth.

125
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,433
Lee Mu Bai,

126
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,433
you really are an idiot.

127
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,934
From now on,

128
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,433
my destiny will be different.

129
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,700
Why is it suddenly windy?

130
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,400
How would I know? Help me pick it up.

131
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,200
How would I know? Help me pick it up.

132
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,467
It is all because you're burning stuff here.

133
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,467
It is not environmentally friendly.

134
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,200
Seriously,

135
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,734
Yi Jun has prepared breakfast for you every day

136
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:45,834
for almost a year now.

137
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,033
It could have warmed the coldest hearts

138
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,166
but you do not even care.

139
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,266
That is heartless.

140
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,734
I did not ask her to buy breakfast for me.

141
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:56,800
Why is it my business?

142
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,400
You're right,

143
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,066
you do not have to do anything.

144
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,200
You just have to be handsome.

145
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,433
Yup.

146
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,567
What is this?

147
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,200
Wow, the handwriting is beautiful.

148
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,700
Hey, Jing Teng.

149
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,367
When you go for a lay-up from the left,

150
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,667
you flinch your right shoulder.

151
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:16,834
Did you know that?

152
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:17,867
What?

153
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,534
It says so right here.

154
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,966
Hey,

155
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:26,667
go look for more.

156
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,534
go look for more.

157
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:30,067
What are you talking about?

158
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,234
Go.

159
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,100
Are you crazy? Why would there be more?

160
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,834
Are you crazy? Why would there be more?

161
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,267
Idiot.

162
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
That's all for today.

163
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,733
Class dismissed.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Are you really going to take this class?

165
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
The professor is tough.

166
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,967
Maybe you should think it over.

167
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,200
Today is the last day for course registration.

168
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,300
There is still time.

169
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't want to change courses.

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,133
Also,

171
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,467
it is a mandatory course

172
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,633
and only this professor is teaching it.

173
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:22,767
You can avoid it now

174
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,266
but you can't avoid it forever.

175
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,066
Why don't you take the course with me?

176
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:27,700
I can lend you

177
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,633
my notes.

178
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:30,834
I knew you're the best.

179
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,100
I love you.

180
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:39,933
Shao Yi Chen.

181
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,166
Which basketball team were you in in high school?

182
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,967
How long have you been stalking me?

183
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,500
Say it.

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,634
Why are you so scared of me?

185
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,133
Because you are scary.

186
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:02,734
Let go of this junior from other people's department.

187
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,834
He's a junior in your department?

188
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:05,800
Yes,

189
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
and he saved my life.

190
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,633
Right? Xiao Bai Mu.

191
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:09,067
Right? Xiao Bai Mu.

192
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,166
You...

193
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,700
Shao Yi Chen.

194
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:13,333
Okay.

195
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,433
Xiao Chen Chen.

196
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,700
Xiao Bai Mu.

197
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,333
They are both mine now.

198
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,834
So, go back to the law department where you belong.

199
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,500
Did they see us?

200
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,233
I don't think so.

201
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,600
Hey,

202
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,633
what did you do to Jiang Jing Teng?

203
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:09,066
It has been a while since he found you in the classroom last time.

204
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,400
Why is he still chasing you?

205
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,233
How would I know?

206
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,633
The Civil Engineering Department is far from the Law Department,

207
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,834
why is he always around?

208
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,934
I didn't even see him

209
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,467
on the 19th.

210
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,600
Why is he chasing me?

211
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,667
You used to watch him secretly.

212
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,800
You didn't get in his way.

213
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Maybe...

214
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,533
he found the pages

215
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,934
we couldn't find

216
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:37,033
so he wants to give you a piece of his mind.

217
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,934
How is that possible?

218
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,200
It could be possible.

219
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,333
Maybe

220
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,367
someone found it and gave it to him.

221
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,066
Even...

222
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:46,734
Even if...

223
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:48,234
Even if that is the case,

224
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:50,734
he'd never know they're from me.

225
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,100
Impossible.

226
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,900
He will never know

227
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,567
a junior named Shao Yi Chen

228
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:28,166
is hiding in the crowd, watching him.

229
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,867
Did you catch him?

230
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:37,633
No,

231
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:39,434
he got away again.

232
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,167
What did a freshman

233
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,100
ever do to you?

234
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,467
Yi Jun is always looking for your attention

235
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,733
but you ignore her.

236
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,166
Why do you keep chasing Shao Yi Chen

237
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,400
just for these pages?

238
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,734
I don't know.

239
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,133
I just have a feeling.

240
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,834
What feeling?

241
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,900
He should be mine.

242
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,567
Jiang Jing Teng,

243
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,033
what is wrong with you?

244
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,333
I have been running around these few days,

245
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,967
tiring myself out

246
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:08,467
for a feeling you have?

247
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,400
for a feeling you have?

248
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,800
What?

249
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,633
Do you have a problem?

250
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:15,133
No.

251
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:15,633
You...

252
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,400
whatever you say.

253
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,166
So,

254
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,333
why would he suddenly come to you?

255
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,233
Or

256
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,500
he saw you somewhere before

257
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,767
and now likes you?

258
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,500
How is that possible?

259
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,933
In high school,

260
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,466
someone once said that

261
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:39,133
he'd be possessive

262
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:43,034
of anyone he likes.

263
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:44,733
No matter if it is a guy or girl,

264
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:45,633
as long as he likes you, that is enough.

265
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:47,167
as long as he likes you, that is enough.

266
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,700
No way.

267
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,867
Then why would he

268
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,200
keep bothering you?

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,333
This can't go on.

270
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,867
We can't even study.

271
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,700
I know.

272
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
Or

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,134
let's dig a hole

274
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,433
and bury him,

275
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,633
or turn him into a tetrapod,

276
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,500
and throw him into the ocean.

277
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
Don't be so merciless.

278
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,067
Don't you think bad people have a better life?

279
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,300
Good people die early,

280
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,700
bad people live forever.

281
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,667
No way.

282
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,466
Jiang Jing Teng has connections.

283
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,867
His dad is the dean of the law department in this school.

284
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:22,934
His mom is a judge.

285
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,200
His sister is a prosecutor.

286
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,266
He comes from a family of law.

287
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,000
Also, he is, as you know,

288
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,134
Also, he is, as you know,

289
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:28,934
a well rounded athlete

290
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,433
who competed as an amateur boxer.

291
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:31,700
If you really want to do something to him,

292
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,067
you are going to be

293
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,400
doomed.

294
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,900
I know.

295
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,000
I was just daydreaming.

296
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,767
Sorry,

297
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,333
for dragging you into all this.

298
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,300
What are you talking about?

299
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,500
We are not strangers.

300
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,134
Besides,

301
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,867
I dragged you down too.

302
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,167
I finally found you.

303
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:56,967
President,

304
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,134
can you tell us

305
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,366
what exactly do you want?

306
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,466
My club

307
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,333
needs two freshmen to join,

308
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,867
so that we can continue operating.

309
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,100
Last time, you saved me

310
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,767
but ran away halfway.

311
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,400
To make up for the fault,

312
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,900
you can help to

313
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,400
save the universal research club I started.

314
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,233
- Huh?
- Huh?

315
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:20,134
He said he needs new members

316
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:21,934
but he just wants laborers.

317
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:24,333
What is this universal research club?

318
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,767
$80 for borrowing a book from the library.

319
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,167
$150 for lining up for tickets.

320
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,800
It is pretty much a servant agency.

321
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,867
At least

322
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,466
he splits it 30-70.

323
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,400
Hey,

324
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,300
he gets 70, we get 30.

325
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,967
At least it is better than being chased.

326
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,866
That's true.

327
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,734
Speaking of which,

328
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,400
I have not seen

329
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,267
Jiang Jing Teng's sidekick following us recently.

330
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,967
That's good.

331
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,133
I told you it was just a random thing.

332
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,667
You didn't believe me.

333
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,167
You worked the night shift again yesterday?

334
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,533
The night shift pays better.

335
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,733
I'll find the rest of the books,

336
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,333
you go find a place to rest

337
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,133
and I'll find you later.

338
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,066
It's okay.

339
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:13,300
It is faster if we look together.

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,900
Look carefully.

341
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,667
I found all the books,

342
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,333
how about you?

343
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,300
Not yet, wait a moment.

344
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,033
Not yet, wait a moment.

345
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:42,000
Why would I have feelings for you?

346
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
If I stop looking for you.

347
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,934
I'd even start missing you.

348
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,766
Shao Yi Chen.

349
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:56,967
Mu Bai,

350
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,100
ten more minutes.

351
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,667
Very good.

352
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,467
Thanks to all of you,

353
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,667
the income of our club is now

354
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:02,666
stronger than ever.

355
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,366
President,

356
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,133
it is just Yi Chen and I.

357
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,000
Of course.

358
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,567
Jiang,

359
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:24,967
are you looking for trouble?

360
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,366
I want to join your club.

361
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,900
Why should I let you join?

362
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Xiao Bai Mu,

363
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
go get the application forms.

364
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:52,266
Hey,

365
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,534
can you do it?

366
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:54,900
Just cover it on top,

367
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,800
okay?

368
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,400
You got it.

369
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,567
You in the back,

370
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,134
can you set up the table here?

371
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,966
Thank you.

372
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:02,900
Do you need help?

373
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:07,834
You...

374
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,967
Hey,

375
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:25,266
is there any way

376
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,934
we can take care of that lunatic?

377
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:28,834
Which one do you want to take care of first?

378
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:29,900
Is it...

379
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,366
Lei Chong Jun, who only just thought of hosting a freshmen camping event

380
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,033
or Jiang Jing Teng, who solves his problems with money.

381
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:34,600
One is crazy about money. The other is crazy about you.

382
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,633
One is crazy about money. The other is crazy about you.

383
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,100
Hey,

384
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,867
Yi Chen.

385
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,733
Will you consider just accepting him?

386
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:43,067
Anyways, you like Jiang Jing Teng.

387
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,000
When he is bored,

388
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,500
you will be free.

389
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,367
You're speaking nonsense.

390
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,567
It doesn't matter if you are together forever.

391
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,766
It only matters if you were together.

392
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,367
Together my ass.

393
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,400
You really are an idiot.

394
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,133
Hey,

395
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,167
Yi Chen.

396
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,567
Have you realized your temper is worse now?

397
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,800
You were always whispering to me,

398
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,400
and now you not only yells

399
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,467
and also hit people all the time.

400
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:07,400
I've had an epiphany, okay?

401
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,667
If people do not offend me,

402
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,100
I do not offend people.

403
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,300
If people offend me,

404
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,667
then I shall offend them.

405
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,767
I used to be too weak

406
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,033
I let people push me around.

407
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:17,967
That is how I ended up like this.

408
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,467
After being reborn,

409
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,500
I will not be a soft pushover.

410
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,400
What do you mean reborn?

411
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,600
I mean,

412
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,034
when I passed out

413
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:32,433
and almost died in the car accident,

414
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,167
I realized

415
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,466
I have to live for my mom

416
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,700
and myself.

417
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,567
Hey,

418
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,767
why are you getting so emotional?

419
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:49,500
Yi Chen,

420
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,533
will you go help her?

421
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:05,634
Let me help you.

422
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,900
Why help her when you can help me?

423
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,867
Let go.

424
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,100
Why are you afraid of me?

425
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,800
I am not afraid of you.

426
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:21,300
I don't want you to be afraid of me.

427
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,266
Jiang Jing Teng, let go of me.

428
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:25,734
Jiang Jing Teng,

429
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,800
put me down.

430
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,600
Jiang Jing Teng.

431
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,567
Let go of me.

432
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,767
Jiang Jing Teng!

433
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,667
Put me down!

434
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:33,867
Let go.

435
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,333
Let go.

436
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:37,667
I was not bothering you,

437
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,533
why won't you leave me alone?

438
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:41,300
I don't know.

439
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,533
I want to be

440
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:46,667
your only one.

441
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,433
Don't you think you can fool me with that for a second time.

442
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:50,000
Don't you think you can fool me with that for a second time.

443
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,967
It is the first time I said it,

444
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,766
there is no second time.

445
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:57,600
Or

446
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,567
did someone else use the same line on you?

447
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,333
No one says something so disgusting like you.

448
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,700
Let go.

449
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,300
Don't push me.

450
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,266
I will push you.

451
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,000
I checked.

452
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
You are my high school schoolmate

453
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,867
and also

454
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,800
my fan.

455
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,700
Who would be so tasteless

456
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,034
to think of you as an idol?

457
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:22,966
Where are the rest of the papers?

458
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,700
What?

459
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,500
Those things you wrote about me,

460
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,333
where is the rest of it?

461
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:40,567
How did you find out?

462
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,300
It is not important.

463
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,333
The important thing is

464
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,200
where is the rest of it?

465
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,700
I want to see it.

466
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,533
I burned it

467
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,767
and used it all to roast sweet potatoes.

468
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,567
Roasting sweet potatoes.

469
00:26:56,567 --> 00:27:01,100
I didn't know there were so many pages

470
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,900
enough to roast sweet potatoes.

471
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,667
I really do have feelings for you.

472
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,667
The Jiang Jing Teng now

473
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,734
is even more shameless.

474
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,166
You have feelings for me too.

475
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,367
Let go of me.

476
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,233
Mu Bai!

477
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,667
Instead of doing this with you this time,

478
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,633
I'd rather die.

479
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:19,200
Shao Yi Chen.

480
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,367
Shao Yi Chen, stop.

481
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,866
Shao Yi Chen.

482
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:26,667
Shao Yi Chen, watch out.

483
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,967
Jiang Jing Teng.

484
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,834
Jiang Jing Teng.

485
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,100
Jiang Jing Teng.

486
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,833
Jiang Jing Teng.

487
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,167
Jiang Jing Teng.

488
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,000
No.

489
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,566
Don't scare me.

490
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:42,266
Don't scare me.

491
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,266
Jiang Jing Teng.

492
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:44,266
No.

493
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,333
Jiang Jing Teng.

494
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,867
Don't scare me.

495
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:54,934
Jiang Jing Teng.

496
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:56,100
Breathe.

497
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,133
Breathe.

498
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,100
Breathe.

499
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,333
Jiang Jing Teng.

500
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,033
Jiang Jing Teng.

501
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,734
Somebody help me...

502
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,800
Anybody!

503
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,834
Anybody!

504
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,100
Jiang Jing Teng.

505
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,734
Jiang Jing Teng.

506
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,400
No.

507
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,700
Someone help me!

508
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,966
Someone help me!

509
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,033
Yi Chen,

510
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:55,333
you have been taking care of him for days.

511
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,134
Why is Jing Teng not getting better?

512
00:31:58,134 --> 00:31:59,633
Chong Jun says

513
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:01,967
he still can not get in touch with Jiang Jing Teng's parents

514
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,533
and he will keep trying.

515
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:08,034
You need to eat something

516
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:10,133
so you have energy.

517
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,433
Tell me,

518
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,766
why did he save me?

519
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:29,766
I don't know.

520
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
But...

521
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,133
Maybe,

522
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,567
he is serious about you,

523
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,367
that is why everything is like this.

524
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:49,200
Jiang Jing Teng.

525
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,433
Jiang Jing Teng.

526
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,167
Are you okay?

527
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,900
I'll go get the doctor.

528
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,433
Who are you?

529
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:46,934
Here.

530
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:48,334
Mom.

531
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:50,900
Jiang,

532
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,834
thank you for saving my son.

533
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,400
Please feel free to stay here

534
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,300
and don't give yourself too much pressure.

535
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,933
Mom.

536
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,533
Let Yi Chen take care of you.

537
00:33:58,533 --> 00:33:58,967
Okay.

538
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:00,033
He just got out of the hospital.

539
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,800
He needs rest.

540
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,867
Okay.

541
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:03,834
You two get some rest.

542
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:04,834
I'll leave you two alone now.

543
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,034
If you need anything just tell Yi Chen.

544
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,534
Thank you, Mom.

545
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:12,700
Thank you, Auntie.

546
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,633
Mom, you should get some rest.

547
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,233
Get some rest.

548
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:24,800
I'm going to take a shower.

549
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,800
I always get

550
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,733
what I want.

551
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,600
Go back to sleep.

552
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm going to wash up

553
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
and get ready for class.

554
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,300
Why was I on the bed?

555
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,667
How was your

556
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,234
first night of amnesia?

557
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,767
No comment.

558
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,966
So mysterious.

559
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,900
Xiao Bai Mu.

560
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,500
What's wrong?

561
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,467
Did you know,

562
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:27,667
ever since the day you saved me,

563
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,933
I have decided to have you.

564
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,433
And you're winking?

565
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:35,433
Are you flirting with me?

566
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't you know that turns me on?

567
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,033
And you're closing your eyes now.

568
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,867
Is that an invitation?

569
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:44,000
President,

570
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,033
what do you want?

571
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:48,667
I want

572
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:52,066
you again.

573
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:00,233
Yi Chen.

574
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:01,866
Time to have breakfast.

575
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:03,433
Coming.

576
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,200
Jiang Jing Teng,

577
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,100
it is breakfast time.

578
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,734
Oh.

579
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:26,034
Jiang,

580
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:28,333
how did you sleep last night?

581
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,567
Does your head still hurt?

582
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:33,833
What's wrong with you?

583
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,667
My mom is asking you a question.

584
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,400
It doesn't hurt.

585
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,834
Here.

586
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,133
Thank you.

587
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:41,800
Later,

588
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,134
when you finish breakfast,

589
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:44,433
remember to take your medicine

590
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,233
before going to class.

591
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:50,000
Let's eat.

592
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,000
What's wrong?

593
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,633
Do you not like porridge?

594
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,566
Or do you not like eggs?

595
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:02,767
No, no.

596
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,534
I like them both.

597
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:07,366
So what's the problem?

598
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:08,767
Is your head hurting?

599
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,167
No.

600
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,567
Let's eat.

601
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,200
Didn't you know?

602
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,167
That guy was neglected since he's little.

603
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,866
No one cared about him.

604
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,467
I think

605
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,067
is it because

606
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,333
he is not used to the loving environment in your home.

607
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:38,066
You know,

608
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:39,967
everyone in his family is busy with their own stuff.

609
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,200
They only act as a family

610
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,800
in public.

611
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,700
How

612
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,833
did you know all this?

613
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,000
Did I never mention

614
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,367
that Jiang Jing Teng, Yi Chun and I

615
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,400
grew up together?

616
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,533
How is that possible?

617
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,300
You don't look like friends.

618
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,834
How can our relationship be good

619
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:02,233
when we were fighting for Yi Chun's attention all our lives.

620
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,100
But that is a long time ago.

621
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,567
Now,

622
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,467
I only have feelings for you.

623
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,566
You...

624
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:27,467
When did this start?

625
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,300
Why?

626
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:33,100
You like girls

627
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,733
and you will be married with children in six years.

628
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,967
Xiao Chen Chen,

629
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:42,266
don't try to be a fortune teller if you're not one.

630
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:44,300
Xiao Bai Mu,

631
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,467
if you dare trying to look for women,

632
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:48,933
you better watch out, or I will...

633
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:04,200
I brought him back from the classroom.

634
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,500
Jiang Jing Teng doesn't have class this afternoon?

635
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,900
No.

636
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,833
Then let's go home.

637
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,266
Home?

638
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,366
Yes.

639
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:18,733
Do you not want to?

640
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:20,033
No.

641
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,266
No.

642
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:22,900
Let's go home.

643
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,667
Let's go home for dinner.

644
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,267
Okay.

645
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:24,400
Be careful.

646
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,500
Sorry, sorry.

647
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,934
Are you okay?

648
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:38,500
I'm fine.

649
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,367
Shao Yi Chen,

650
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,233
I'm hungry.

651
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,166
Make me some food.

652
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,500
Quickly.

653
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,100
Okay.

654
00:44:57,533 --> 00:44:59,633
Not like that.

655
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,700
It's the same.

656
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:43,767
Look at them,

657
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,667
you should just give up.

658
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:48,966
I don't want to.

659
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,400
You are making it hard for me to read.

660
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:05,133
I have to keep my head elevated.

661
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:06,566
You...

662
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,200
Did the doctor say when you can remove the stitches?

663
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,700
Why?

664
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:16,133
Are you sick of me?

665
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,500
You don't want to take care of me anymore?

666
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,667
No.

667
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:21,134
Because you

668
00:47:21,134 --> 00:47:22,667
saved me,

669
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:24,300
I will take care of you

670
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,400
until you get better.

671
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,967
I am just concerned about you.

672
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:31,133
I think everything is great now.

673
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:34,700
Don't you want to remember the past?

674
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:38,300
You weren't there.

675
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,634
Why would I want to remember?

676
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:42,400
No way.

677
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,467
I can't be fooled again.

678
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:46,300
Shao Yi Chen.

679
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Do not forget,

680
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,767
you're twenty nine years old now,

681
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:51,833
not nineteen.

682
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:54,133
Don't take this childish nonesense

683
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:56,000
too personally.

684
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:01,500
Hey.

685
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,266
Let go.

686
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:06,333
This time,

687
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,467
I will not let you get away.

688
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,734
You like me.

689
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:12,667
That's not—

690
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:36,100
You do like me.

691
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:20,667
Xiao Bai Mu,

692
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,533
let me ask you.

693
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:22,433
Hey,

694
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,034
hold on.

695
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:26,533
You're calling me Xiao Bai Mu too?

696
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:28,600
I got used to it.

697
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,367
That's not the point.

698
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,367
I'm saying,

699
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,700
how do you know you'd like someone

700
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,366
who you can't avoid

701
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:39,900
but you'd be doomed if you like him?

702
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:43,533
I think about that everyday.

703
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:44,934
Chong Jun loves money,

704
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:45,467
is irresponsible,

705
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:46,467
talks nonsense

706
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,200
and is a player.

707
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,433
How could I have feelings

708
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:51,200
for someone like him?

709
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,367
I don't want to like him

710
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,567
but I can't help myself.

711
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:57,834
All I can say is

712
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:59,033
I got dizzy

713
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,967
and fell under his spell.

714
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:02,400
I know I shouldn't

715
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,200
but I still go for him.

716
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:07,833
All I can do is surrender.

717
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,767
You are not

718
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:14,467
even going to fight it?

719
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,467
Can fighting it stop me from liking him?

720
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:24,800
There you go.

721
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,633
So before I stop liking him,

722
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:28,767
I could only like hime as it is.

723
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:30,900
I'm happy when I spend time with him,

724
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,667
there's no point in thinking too much.

725
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:35,600
What if

726
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,967
you got killed in a car accident

727
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:39,500
because you like him?

728
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,767
Killed in a car accident?

729
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,067
You've got to watch where you're going.

730
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:48,500
You are not one of those people

731
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,300
who commit suicide just because your crush doesn't love you?

732
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,233
That is impossible.

733
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:53,800
Then that's settled.

734
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,700
Maybe,

735
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,300
before you die for him,

736
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,500
he will die for you.

737
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,166
In truth,

738
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,600
after I was reborn

739
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,567
I selected another way to keep Jiang Jing Teng away.

740
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,600
Something are similar,

741
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,867
but something are not.

742
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,634
I still met Jiang Jing Teng,

743
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:20,400
but I also met Chong Jun

744
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,133
who I didn't know.

745
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,400
Run faster.

746
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,467
I don't want to,

747
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:27,233
they will only chase me.

748
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,500
Mu Bai had a girlfriend

749
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,867
but now he has a boyfriend.

750
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:35,734
You...

751
00:51:35,734 --> 00:51:37,866
When did this happen?

752
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,066
You should only worry about the future

753
00:51:41,066 --> 00:51:43,567
when the future becomes now.

754
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,734
Worry about the future

755
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:49,866
when the future happens.

756
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,100
That makes sense.

757
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,067
Why did you want to see me?

758
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:08,367
Jiang Jing Teng,

759
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:09,867
what is so great about Shao Yi Chen

760
00:52:09,867 --> 00:52:12,600
that you will pretend to have amnesia just to be closer to him?

761
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,434
It has nothing to do with you.

762
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:16,433
Yes, it does.

763
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,934
I will tell your parents about it.

764
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,800
Stop threatening me with my parents.

765
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,367
I don't stand up to them

766
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:23,800
and do everything they say

767
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,066
but that doesn't mean I am scared of them.

768
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:27,166
I let you follow me

769
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,600
because I could care less to push you away.

770
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,367
Let go.

771
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,700
I'm telling you.

772
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,800
I hate people threatening me.

773
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,200
Remember that

774
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,000
and never do it again.

775
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,866
Do you hear me?

776
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,167
You don't have amnesia?

777
00:52:52,233 --> 00:52:53,667
Are you surprised?

778
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:55,300
He has been lying to you this whole time

779
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,534
just to

780
00:52:58,534 --> 00:52:59,067
get closer to you.

781
00:52:59,067 --> 00:52:59,500
Go away.

782
00:52:59,500 --> 00:52:59,667
Go away.

783
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:00,667
I will go.

784
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:02,567
I will go as soon as I say what I have to say.

785
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:03,800
He is the type of person

786
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,934
who will do anything

787
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:06,767
to get the thing he wants.

788
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:07,734
Once he is interested in you,

789
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:08,367
he will haunt you for the rest of your life.

790
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,200
Cai Yi Chun.

791
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,533
Let me explain.

792
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:15,066
I am sorry.

793
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:18,867
I will deal with you later.

794
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:23,333
Shao Yi Chen.

795
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:26,533
That was close.

796
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:28,467
I still have my neck.

797
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:31,833
Why would you provoke him like that?

798
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,033
You scared the hell out of me.

799
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:35,400
Why didn't you signal for help?

800
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:38,333
Although Jiang Jing Teng has emotional issues,

801
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:39,533
he is not stupid.

802
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:41,200
He won't do anything to me.

803
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,033
Why are you doing this?

804
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,667
Believe me, if I don't do this

805
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:46,834
Jiang Jing Teng will pretend to have amnesia forever,

806
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:48,733
just to keep Shao Yi Chen by his side.

807
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:49,567
No way.

808
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:50,967
How can he pretend for the rest of his life?

809
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:53,000
By using Shao Yi Chen's

810
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,800
good nature and his guilt.

811
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,900
So that's why

812
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,266
you wanted me to tell Shao Yi Chen that you were here,

813
00:53:59,266 --> 00:54:01,300
so that he could hear your conversation.

814
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,667
Hey, but

815
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:05,634
what good can come from exposing him?

816
00:54:05,634 --> 00:54:07,033
Are you breaking them up?

817
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:08,233
Hey, am I that type of person?

818
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:09,367
That is exactly what you did.

819
00:54:09,367 --> 00:54:10,800
I am just forcing him

820
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,100
to tell the truth.

821
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,033
Huh?

822
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:14,267
Him?

823
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:15,333
Who?

824
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,467
Isn't love about

825
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:18,567
mutual affections?

826
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:20,867
He uses guilt to tie someone down

827
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:22,967
because he is scared of being rejected due to his reputation.

828
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:24,900
What kind of man is that?

829
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,567
He will kill you.

830
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,000
I have you.

831
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,934
You will protect me, right?

832
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,800
Boyfriend.

833
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,233
When did I become your boyfriend?

834
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:34,834
A minute ago.

835
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:37,267
Buying you breakfast for a year was not a waste.

836
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:41,267
Shao Yi Chen.

837
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:43,800
Shao Yi Chen, listen to me.

838
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:51,066
He lied to me.

839
00:54:51,066 --> 00:54:53,500
He doesn't have amnesia.

840
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,466
I'm such an idiot.

841
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:56,700
I am so naive to think

842
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,633
something with him will also change

843
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:00,734
if something has changed in this life.

844
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:01,934
Jiang Jing Teng

845
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:03,033
is a liar

846
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,433
no matter nowadays or in the future.

847
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:14,667
Why?

848
00:55:14,766 --> 00:55:17,133
Why?

849
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,400
Shao Yi Chen!

850
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,166
Idiot!

851
00:56:01,633 --> 00:56:04,000
Why didn't you run away?

852
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,033
Jiang Jing Teng

853
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:18,233
let go of me.

854
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:19,967
This is my house.

855
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,666
It is my house too.

856
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:23,700
What is yours is mine.

857
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:27,567
Are you crazy?

858
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,500
I am crazy.

859
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,533
I am crazy about you

860
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:35,267
because of those pages.

861
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,733
Those damn pages got me attracted to you.

862
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:40,733
You have

863
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:42,534
those pages.

864
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:44,767
Why didn't you keep pursuing me?

865
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:46,333
Why didn't you keep writing?

866
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:48,000
Let go of me.

867
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,133
I did not want to go on anymore.

868
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,867
Shao Yi Chen.

869
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:07,500
You started the game,

870
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,500
and I am the only one

871
00:57:12,534 --> 00:57:15,133
who can end it.

872
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:17,067
I want you to see me.

873
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,833
I want to be your one and only.

874
00:57:23,033 --> 00:57:25,400
Remember,

875
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,100
I just saved your life.

876
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,900
From now on,

877
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:33,367
your being,

878
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:36,300
your heart,

879
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,267
your body

880
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:42,300
belongs to me.

881
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,567
Have you lost your mind?

882
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,133
Yes,

883
00:57:51,266 --> 00:57:53,433
I have lost my mind.

884
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:58,900
This is all your fault

885
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,700
so it is your responsibility.

886
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,100
You can not abandon me.

887
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:10,300
You can not take back

888
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,267
that feeling of being taken care of

889
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:17,467
and the happiness when we're together.

890
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,166
From now on,

891
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,967
everything you have is mine.

892
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:29,566
What do I have that is worthy of you?

893
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,433
You like me.

894
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:09,533
Jiang Jing Teng,

895
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:10,934
what is so great about Shao Yi Chen

896
00:59:10,934 --> 00:59:12,733
that you will pretend to have memory loss just to be closer to him?

897
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:13,333
Let me tell you,

898
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,467
he is the type of person

899
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,367
who will do anything

900
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:16,834
to get the thing he wants.

901
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:18,733
Cai Yi Jun.

902
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,434
You started liking me a long time ago, didn't you?

903
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,733
You were worried that I didn't like you

904
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:35,900
so you pretended to have amnesia.

905
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,733
You wanted to use my guilt to tie me down.

906
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:43,500
You wanted me to confess my love first.

907
00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:48,367
You're afraid that—

908
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,500
If I don't like you...

909
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:17,700
I would kill you.

910
01:00:18,966 --> 01:00:22,000
If I can't have you,

911
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,667
no one else can have you.

912
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:43,067
You really are obsessed.

913
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,034
Lunatic.

914
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,200
I had a second chance

915
01:00:55,034 --> 01:00:57,400
but I still like you.

916
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,900
I like you too.

917
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:08,033
I really like you.

918
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:16,767
Hold me.

919
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,800
Please hold me.

920
01:02:20,133 --> 01:02:22,233
You said you would hold me

921
01:02:22,233 --> 01:02:24,767
and never let go.

922
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,633
You said.

923
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,300
You killed Yi Chen.

924
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,033
It's all your fault.

925
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:19,634
Jing Teng was protecting him.

926
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:21,333
He didn't want his parents giving Shao Yi Chen a hard time,

927
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,800
so he faked the engagement with me.

928
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,400
Bullshit.

929
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,667
He just doesn't want to admit

930
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:26,634
he loves Yi Chen.

931
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:28,100
Mu Bai,

932
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,067
watch your mouth.

933
01:04:53,634 --> 01:04:55,000
Shao Yi Chen!

934
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:55,567
Jing Teng.

935
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:56,734
Come back.

936
01:04:56,734 --> 01:04:58,033
Jing Teng, come on.

937
01:04:58,033 --> 01:04:58,734
Come back.

938
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:00,800
Shao Yi Chen is dead.

939
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,634
He listens to me.

940
01:05:02,634 --> 01:05:05,567
If I want him back, he will come back.

941
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:08,166
Shao Yi Chen.

942
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,700
I want him back.

943
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:58,500
Shao Yi Chen.

944
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,500
Jiang Jing Teng.

945
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:03,400
- Shao Yi Chen.
- Jiang Jing Teng.

946
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,333
Shao Yi Chen.

947
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:06,100
Jiang Jing Teng.

948
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:17,200
What's wrong?

949
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:22,400
I just had a dream.

950
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,600
You were killed in a car accident.

951
01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:28,000
I didn't believe you were dead.

952
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,167
I even dug up your grave.

953
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:33,200
What are you talking about?

954
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36,500
Why did he dream

955
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,966
of what happened to me in 2025?

956
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:43,000
Why?

957
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:48,933
Did you dream of that

958
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:51,133
because I was in a car accident before?

959
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,267
I don't know.

960
01:06:57,233 --> 01:06:59,767
I even dreamed of

961
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,133
faking a marriage with Yi Chun

962
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:05,800
so that my parents wouldn't find out about you.

963
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,866
That's why you left in anger

964
01:07:08,866 --> 01:07:10,833
and got hit by the car.

965
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:14,200
His engagement was fake.

966
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,433
What is going on?

967
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:21,433
I, Jiang Jing Teng,

968
01:07:21,433 --> 01:07:23,100
will never do something so lame as

969
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,133
using a woman to protect myself.

970
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:27,967
I'll protect my love

971
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:30,567
on my own.

972
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:32,400
You are mine.

973
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,500
No one else can touch you.

974
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:41,633
I still love him wholeheartedly

975
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:44,967
after dying once for him.

976
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:18,367
Jiang Jing Teng.

977
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,967
What?

978
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,534
No matter in the future

979
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:25,166
or in the present,

980
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,066
I

981
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:29,967
am my own person.

982
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:33,833
Say it again.

983
01:08:41,734 --> 01:08:43,933
You are also mine.

984
01:08:48,634 --> 01:08:50,867
As for who own's whom

985
01:08:50,867 --> 01:08:52,767
the body

986
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,333
knows all the answers.

987
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:02,367
Jiang Jing Teng!

988
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:11,867
It tickles.

989
01:09:11,867 --> 01:09:13,700
Jiang Jing Teng.
