1
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,467
What are you doing?

2
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,333
Go! Hurry!

3
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,966
Gu Si Ren, are you okay?

4
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:40,133
Gu Si Ren, are you okay?

5
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:40,500
Gu Si Ren. Wake up!

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,334
Gu Si Ren. Wake up!

7
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,000
Gu Si Ren.

8
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,130
You're my hero

9
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,890
You're my hero

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,100
Why are young people so lazy these days?

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,833
Hey,

12
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,033
stop pretending to be asleep.

13
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:12,800
Come on, follow me.

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,267
Come on, follow me.

15
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,700
Hey, who are you?

16
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,267
I am...

17
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,833
What weird look is that?

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,566
Hero.

19
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:36,333
Mei Hero.

20
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,300
Go away.

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,033
Mei Hero.

22
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,800
Why are you ignoring me?

23
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you get tired of living?

24
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,366
To simply put it,

25
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,100
you are dead.

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,634
That's why you can see me.

27
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:12,700
Hello.

28
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,600
My name is Bai Chang Chang.

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
I am your underworld deliverer.

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,967
In your journey ahead,

31
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,633
I will be there to help you.

32
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,633
Come with me.

33
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,233
Let go of me.

34
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:29,867
Just accept it

35
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,833
and sign this death certificate.

36
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:36,766
If you do not sign it,

37
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:42,300
you might become a lost soul.

38
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,200
Oh yeah.

39
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,300
Don't people say money can persuade ghosts?

40
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
Let me tell you,

41
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,533
my family is very rich.

42
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,600
Why don't you tell me your price

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,100
and I'll go back and ask my parents.

44
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,200
Just let me go back.

45
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,900
Why don't you give up?

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,166
I told you.

47
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,667
If I let you go,

48
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,733
not only will you go to hell,

49
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,400
I'll be in trouble too.

50
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:11,667
Also, I'm a messenger

51
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,033
Also, I'm a messenger

52
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,200
not a ghost.

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,500
I am Bai Chang Chang.

54
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Do not call me "Hey".

55
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,767
Hey,

56
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,200
can I really not go back?

57
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:26,867
What is going to happen to me and my beloved Hero?

58
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,533
You have to be responsible for your own life.

59
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:30,800
I say child,

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,367
you have had a hard life.

61
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,100
Lonely all your life.

62
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
Poverty and illness.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,033
Hey. What is your problem?

64
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,433
Hey. What is your problem?

65
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:38,734
Why don't you go online and check

66
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:42,633
Lan Chih Sheng of the Lan Hai group? He is my father.

67
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,633
Or are you such an ancient ghost

68
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:49,200
that you don't even know what Google is.

69
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,633
What a blatant lie.

70
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,734
Gu Si Ren, your last name is Gu.

71
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,967
How is your father named

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,367
Lan?

73
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,533
You just said your father's name is Lan Chih Sheng.

74
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,800
What about yours?

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,567
Lan Si.

76
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,233
Didn't you say you can revive me?

77
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,700
Your body is gone.

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,800
Forget about the revival.

79
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,300
You were just cremated.

80
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,167
You must be feeling hot.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,566
You're welcome.

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,433
Hero.

83
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,400
I am really

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,100
sorry. You did not get to see your girlfriend one last time

85
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,766
because of a worthless person like me.

86
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,400
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,333
That person without an aura,

88
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,900
is it because he should be dead?

89
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,767
Is he the one that should be in your place?

90
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:10,367
Gu Si Ren.

91
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,133
Lan Si?

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,967
Aren't you...

93
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,200
No way.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,867
You can die like this?

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,233
Yes.

96
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:38,200
He really is dead.

97
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,467
Hurry, get into his body.

98
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,167
Hey,

99
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,900
I will take Gu Si Ren to the afterlife first.

100
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,734
Besides, you wanted to be revived right?

101
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,300
Borrow his body first.

102
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,966
I'm going to go.

103
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,300
Good bye.

104
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,900
What a weird dream.

105
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,167
I dreamt that I was dead

106
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:09,766
and saw Bai Chang Chang.

107
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,467
What?

108
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,100
Oh my god!

109
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,033
That wasn't a dream.

110
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:22,200
I really am trapped in Gu Si Ren's body.

111
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,000
I better not.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,200
I don't dare to touch it.

113
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,600
Calm down.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,933
Lan Si, calm down.

115
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,400
If I look at it another way,

116
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,133
being in Gu Si Ren's body

117
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,667
means that

118
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,767
I am alive again.

119
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:02,233
I wanted to be revived

120
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,866
so I can be by Hero's side again.

121
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,567
But I'm Gu Si Ren now,

122
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,766
and Gu Si Ren is a man.

123
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,200
How am I going to

124
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,767
be with Hero now?

125
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,833
Bai Chang Chang,

126
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,900
where are you?

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,433
My body is male now,

128
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,433
what do you want me to do?

129
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,234
Get out here.

130
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:21,267
Come on!

131
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm a immortal being.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,933
If I appear every time you call,

133
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,000
how am I going to save some face?

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,467
Tell me,

135
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,333
how am I going to be by Hero's side

136
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,334
if I'm like this now?

137
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,933
Okay,

138
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:34,300
it's time for a risky move.

139
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,267
Risky move?

140
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,333
If you have a way, why didn't you tell me earlier?

141
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,900
Stop being a tease.

142
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,033
That hurts.

143
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,400
- Tell me now.
- Okay...

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,467
I'm ticklish.

145
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,933
Don't do that, I'll tell you.

146
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:46,833
Okay.

147
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,100
Here it is.

148
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,367
To make up for my mistake of putting you in the wrong body,

149
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,867
and since you want to get back to Hero so badly,

150
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,833
I think

151
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,567
this is true love.

152
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,900
I, Bai Chang Chang,

153
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
am not unreasonable.

154
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,834
So—

155
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,634
Get to the point.

156
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,100
Okay.

157
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,233
So the key point is that

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,133
after a person dies,

159
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,800
there is a seven day buffer period.

160
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
In this time,

161
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
if you make Hero fall in love with you

162
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,000
and kiss you,

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,267
his life force will pass onto you

164
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,900
and the reaper will not find you.

165
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,233
If this happens, you can keep on living.

166
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,267
That's ridiculous.

167
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,733
I don't even have breasts.

168
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,967
I know it is ridiculous,

169
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:30,400
but

170
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,000
borrowing someone's body is an intolerable thing in the world.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,266
You can not tell anyone.

172
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,634
But my body is male now,

173
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:39,733
how am I going to get him to love me?

174
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,400
That is up to you to solve.

175
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,333
The seven day love quest.

176
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,167
Starts

177
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,267
now.

178
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,610
[Day 1]

179
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:57,533
This guy looks like he is recovering pretty well.

180
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,934
Good morning, Xiong baby.

181
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,867
Good morning, Xiong baby.

182
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,400
What?

183
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,533
Si Ren,

184
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:36,733
can you not attack me with your sword in the morning? It is time to get up.

185
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:40,067
Five more minutes.

186
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,167
I already let you stay at my house,

187
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,367
you're acting out of line now.

188
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,000
It looks really bad that

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
two grown men are hugging each other.

190
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,100
What?

191
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,900
Hero.

192
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,534
I feel strange down there,

193
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,633
it's really uncomfortable.

194
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,133
Hero,

195
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,400
what is it?

196
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
Help me with it.

197
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,234
It's disgusting, I don't dare touch it.

198
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,467
Gu Si Ren.

199
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,233
You really became dumb.

200
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,600
Is it your first day being a man?

201
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
I'm not a man.

202
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
God,

203
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,967
that was really embarrassing.

204
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,633
Hero probably didn't realize I'm Lan Si.

205
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,633
Why did I agree to Bai Chang Chang's stupid rules?

206
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
With this face

207
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,133
and this body,

208
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,100
how is he going to fall in love with me?

209
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,900
Hero is a very straight man,

210
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,267
how is he going to fall in love with me as a boy?

211
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:09,267
Now I have to turn my own boyfriend gay.

212
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,167
God,

213
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,433
this is so sad.

214
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:24,166
I don't want to be trapped in this unlucky body for the rest of my life.

215
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,400
What should I do?

216
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:11,433
Why is my Hero so handsome?

217
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,967
I'm ovulating because he is so handsome.

218
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:23,934
No, I can't ovulate now.

219
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:27,766
But how am I going to make him fall in love with me?

220
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:34,367
I'll start by becoming his guy friend to shorten the distance between us.

221
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,400
Hey,

222
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,467
the teacher is going to take attendance today.

223
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,534
Hurry up or you'll be late.

224
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,733
Oh okay.

225
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm going to school first.

226
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,033
Okay, wait for me.

227
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,233
I'll grab my bag from the bedroom.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,800
Mei Hero, look.

229
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,133
My shirt looks super great.

230
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,667
Hero.

231
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,967
Hero.

232
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:15,900
Look.

233
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,700
What is he doing?

234
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,300
What are you doing?

235
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,000
No...

236
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,633
Nothing.

237
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,533
Oh my god.

238
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,567
You really hit your head, didn't you?

239
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,066
You weirdo.

240
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,500
Do you live alone?

241
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,700
Huh?

242
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,334
Do you live alone?

243
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,367
I say you are

244
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,400
destined to be alone and unlucky

245
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,367
plus you're poor and prone to illness.

246
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,233
You brought bad luck to your parents and caused their deaths.

247
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,867
You are better off dead.

248
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,867
My parents—

249
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,166
After you hurt yourself and knocked yourself out the other day,

250
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,300
the school said they couldn't reach your family,

251
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,266
and with your poor health,

252
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:00,166
I'm worried the bullies will come for you again.

253
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,667
How about this.

254
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,066
If you are alone,

255
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,767
why don't you come stay with me for a while?

256
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:06,734
Yes!

257
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,133
I didn't think it would be so easy

258
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,933
to stay with Hero.

259
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,300
Is that okay?

260
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,367
Stupid.

261
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,034
We are all friends now.

262
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,400
Let's go.

263
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,667
Hey,

264
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,500
I warn you.

265
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,800
Don't touch me inappropriately when you come to my house.

266
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,100
Gu Si Ren.

267
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,600
I didn't think being a man would be so tiring.

268
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,733
Qin Qin,

269
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,700
your facial mask is really good.

270
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,934
They are really moisturizing and sticks to the face

271
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,200
and the lotion does not drip.

272
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,766
It is really nice.

273
00:17:58,433 --> 00:17:59,834
I'm not going to waste it.

274
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:03,000
What did you just call me?

275
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,433
What?

276
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:07,333
You just called me

277
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,100
Qin Qin.

278
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:11,400
Hey,

279
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,300
only Lan Si called me that.

280
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,900
Oh no,

281
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,967
I didn't think I would give it away so quickly.

282
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,533
You are gay, right?

283
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,933
You are gay, right?

284
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,467
Yes,

285
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,567
I am.

286
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,300
I knew it.

287
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,367
No wonder you have

288
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,967
that kind of demeanor to you.

289
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:53,066
Don't worry,

290
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,000
it is not the past anymore.

291
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
There is nothing to hide.

292
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,134
Hide what?

293
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,000
Hi.

294
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Hero, did you know

295
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Si Ren is also ga—

296
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,500
Okay...

297
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,367
I won't tell.

298
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,700
Hero, guess what?

299
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,100
This facial mask is really good.

300
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,000
Do you want to try it?

301
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,133
You…

302
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,733
Why are you wearing my underwear?

303
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,000
Why not?

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,467
Isn't this underwear

305
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,267
the pair I got—

306
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,800
Mei Hero, happy birthday!

307
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,600
It is covered in hearts.

308
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,300
We are good friends now,

309
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,733
what is the problem with me borrowing your underwear?

310
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:59,300
Don't be so fussy.

311
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:01,567
Ya Qing,

312
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,533
keep applying the lotion.

313
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,234
Yes.

314
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:05,033
Then

315
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,133
you can have it.

316
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,967
How is that okay?

317
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:09,800
Stupid,

318
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,667
everything is okay between good friends.

319
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,167
I'm going to bed first.

320
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,800
Good night.

321
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,667
Hey.

322
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,367
That's weird.

323
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,000
Mei Hero!

324
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,033
How can you give someone else the gift I gave you?

325
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,966
[Day 2]
Just be a good person to the end.

326
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,967
God,

327
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,700
this stuff is really dirty.

328
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,667
It is insulting to my pure, godly character.

329
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,733
Do you understand?

330
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:41,367
So,

331
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,067
are you male or female?

332
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:46,400
Immortal beings don't have a gender.

333
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,700
What?

334
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,966
You really don't have anything there.

335
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,500
Be respectful.

336
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,633
Why are you touching me?

337
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,467
Do you want me to show you this too?

338
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,434
I don't want to see it.

339
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,700
So do you know how to do it?

340
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Stand still.

341
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,633
Take off your pants.

342
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,533
Hey,

343
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,500
don't take the whole thing off.

344
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,867
Just pull down the elastic

345
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,500
and take out the hose.

346
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,567
Oh.

347
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,333
Is it out yet?

348
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,300
Okay.

349
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,367
Keep your legs apart.

350
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,367
Relax.

351
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,833
Get ready.

352
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,600
Full power

353
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,167
and let it go.

354
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,967
Bring it on!

355
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,633
That's right,

356
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,433
just like that.

357
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:39,500
I see you can be taught.

358
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,967
Practice more now while you can.

359
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,800
Why does it feel strange?

360
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:52,467
Why is it getting bigger?

361
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:54,600
I can't help you with that.

362
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,367
I'm leaving now.

363
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,967
I'm going to attempt a very difficult mission now.

364
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,667
How do you play?

365
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't touch it randomly.

366
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:10,634
You almost got me killed.

367
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:12,267
I know how.

368
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,500
Good start.

369
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:15,867
You can do it.

370
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,533
This is my chance.

371
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:17,800
A chance, a chance.

372
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,266
Last strike.

373
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:21,400
Last strike.

374
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,333
Go Hero.

375
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,800
I did it!

376
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:29,900
Yes!

377
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,400
Yes!

378
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,033
Yes!

379
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,233
Give me five.

380
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,066
I missed this.

381
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,967
Every night we used to

382
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,967
play games together like this.

383
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,233
I mean…

384
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,134
I don't know if you and Lan Si used to

385
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:54,133
play games together like this.

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,467
Why are you talking about that?

387
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,167
I don't want to talk about her now.

388
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:02,900
Hero,

389
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,767
I'm not trying to pry.

390
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,033
It's fine.

391
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:08,733
I am tired.

392
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:09,633
I'm going to bed first.

393
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,767
Okay.

394
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,900
Good night.

395
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,466
That makes sense.

396
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:27,000
It must be upsetting for Hero to talk about me.

397
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,100
He is such a man,

398
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,966
he wouldn't want to cry in front of others.

399
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:33,434
It must be like this.

400
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:40,600
14...

401
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,733
15...

402
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,867
I can't…

403
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,167
No more...

404
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,734
I have to keep going if I want to be skinny.

405
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,800
That hurts.

406
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:02,600
I hit my foot.

407
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,800
What is that?

408
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:12,500
Is it Hero's pornography?

409
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,700
I really do not understand

410
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,300
why they can have no problems with

411
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,133
building their happiness on the pain of others?

412
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,333
Why do they treat me like this?

413
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:44,067
I'm sad but no tears flow.

414
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,734
It feels as if my sense of pain is cut off.

415
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,633
It is as if I am alone in this world.

416
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,167
I don't want to go to class.

417
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,633
I want to die.

418
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,367
I have no one to talk to.

419
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,433
I feel very lonely.

420
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:06,533
This is

421
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,000
Gu Si Ren's notebook.

422
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,033
Wow,

423
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,867
he is so sad.

424
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:15,034
I ran into him on the balcony again today.

425
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:16,834
He put his arm around my shoulders and said

426
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:20,000
if you're sad, you should cry and let it out.

427
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,433
At that moment, all my sadness disappeared;

428
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:25,467
After class today,

429
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,366
he came and told me,

430
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:29,833
dodge when they hit you

431
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,633
don't just take it,

432
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:32,166
you understand?

433
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,233
Stupid.

434
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,433
Does this mean he cares about me?

435
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:40,433
It is not just that he cares,

436
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:43,000
it probably means he also likes me.

437
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,633
Who would be so nice for no reason?

438
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:52,967
Who would have thought,

439
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,433
even an unlucky person like Gu Si Ren would have someone watching his back.

440
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,967
I must try harder.

441
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,233
I only have five days left.

442
00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:02,400
With my charms,

443
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,767
it doesn't matter if he is an alien

444
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,900
or a hobbit,

445
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,000
I will win over Hero.

446
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:08,767
Keep it up!

447
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,000
[Day 3]
I made breakfast for you today.

448
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:34,600
So spicy.

449
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,633
You added hot sauce?

450
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:36,366
Yes.

451
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,567
This is my special hot sauce breakfast.

452
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:41,734
Not too bad, right?

453
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:43,767
It's good.

454
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,667
I'll make you another one if it's good.

455
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,633
Don't be too touched.

456
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,166
Don't be too touched.

457
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,400
What?

458
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:58,166
Nothing.

459
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,767
Lan Si used to add hot sauce to her breakfast too.

460
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,333
Really?

461
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,333
Yeah.

462
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,867
I used to think it was quite disgusting.

463
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,933
I just never told her.

464
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:11,266
What?

465
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:12,466
If you don't like it,

466
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:15,467
why did you act like you really like it before?

467
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,800
I mean,

468
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,366
if you didn't like it

469
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,333
why didn't you tell Lan Si?

470
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,400
Tell her?

471
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:25,500
Come on!

472
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,800
She was a rich princess

473
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,900
with a heart of glass.

474
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,467
If I told her, my life would have been hell.

475
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,800
I came back to life

476
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,767
just to listen to this garbage?

477
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,200
Why did you lie?

478
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,833
Lying is

479
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,433
very disrespectful.

480
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:43,333
I did not mean to lie to her.

481
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,167
Don't you know, hiding the truth

482
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,333
hurts her as well?

483
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,000
That's because she—

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
You always do this.

485
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,266
You don't say anything

486
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,133
then push the blame onto someone else.

487
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:53,900
You only avoid problems.

488
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,800
What kind of man are you?

489
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,967
Strange,

490
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,500
you're talking like you know.

491
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,200
You didn't date Lan Si.

492
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,867
I...

493
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:01,734
Do you know how suffocating

494
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:03,300
the type of love where

495
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,633
you impose your thoughts on the other person is?

496
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,600
Suffocating?

497
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:08,866
Okay.

498
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:10,233
Mei Hero.

499
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,733
Congratulations.

500
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,166
Lan Si is dead now.

501
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,433
You are free.

502
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,700
You are back?

503
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,300
Yeah.

504
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:51,000
Do you want to drink?

505
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,833
About this morning,

506
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,800
I am so sorry.

507
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,200
It is fine.

508
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
By the way,

509
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,567
when you were jumped last time,

510
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,034
I did not have time to take you to the infirmary.

511
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,433
I'm sorry about that.

512
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,533
I realized you could still cry,

513
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:51,734
so I was not that worried about you.

514
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:56,733
Oh.

515
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,667
I can understand

516
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,066
you standing up for Lan Si this morning.

517
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,200
I thought that silently accepting those interactions like I did

518
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,567
is not me hiding the truth

519
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:16,500
but is love

520
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,734
or acceptance.

521
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,033
Well...

522
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,800
You putting up with it

523
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,266
means that you loved her so much.

524
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:34,467
Lan Si was good at studying,

525
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,300
very smart,

526
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:37,000
had a good eye for things

527
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,600
and good tastes.

528
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,366
She was very beautiful

529
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:42,533
and loyal.

530
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,433
She never let go

531
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,067
of the things that she wanted.

532
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:48,400
She was very persistent.

533
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,333
Honestly,

534
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,433
when I was with her,

535
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:58,600
besides all the compliments and envy we received from people,

536
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I was very content

537
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,800
with having a girlfriend like that.

538
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,867
It was very flattering.

539
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,300
I'm jealous you had

540
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,200
such a hot and fantastic girlfriend.

541
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:20,400
About all your small, hidden displeasures,

542
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,600
I'm sure she can understand.

543
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,000
Come on.

544
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,933
Cheers!

545
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:40,800
I believe she really loved me.

546
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:45,000
She would apply all her methods for happiness on me.

547
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:48,033
But sometimes,

548
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,433
I really did not know how to handle it.

549
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:53,833
I could not get her to understand the real me.

550
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,567
After some time,

551
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:59,734
I closed off my feelings and emotions.

552
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:07,600
Then why did you not tell me before?

553
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,567
I mean,

554
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,834
if Lan Si was that smart,

555
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,500
why did you not tell her?

556
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,000
She would have understood.

557
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:30,767
I do not know why.

558
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,533
My struggles,

559
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,067
confusion,

560
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:35,400
and helplessness,

561
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,166
I could not express them in front of her.

562
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:52,300
You should try to not close yourself off.

563
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,367
Aiyo,

564
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,300
do not think too much.

565
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,266
I'm sure she can understand you.

566
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,967
Hero,

567
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,800
why are you telling me all this?

568
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:41,767
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.

569
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:46,733
Oh.

570
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,867
[Day 4]
Don't go.

571
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,400
I have something to ask you.

572
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,500
I do not understand you straight men.

573
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
Love has always

574
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,233
spawned from friendship.

575
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,800
And

576
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,266
when you spend enough time together

577
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,000
and it feels right,

578
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,800
just go for it.

579
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,400
How can I be sure I like the other person?

580
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:26,667
That is easy.

581
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,300
Think about it.

582
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,200
When you are with him,

583
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
do you feel like you have a lot to talk about?

584
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,433
Do you feel extra close with each other

585
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:36,800
Yes.

586
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,500
There you go.

587
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,034
That feeling of hitting it off immediately and

588
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:46,167
being comfortable with someone else,

589
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:49,300
slowly blurs your vision.

590
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,500
And

591
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:53,267
it mesmerizes you into wanting to

592
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:54,567
it mesmerizes you into wanting to

593
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,700
kiss him...

594
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,533
That's it!

595
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,567
That is what liking someone is like.

596
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,333
What do I do? What do I do?

597
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,934
I'm so confused.

598
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,233
I want him to love me

599
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:14,066
but I'm scared of him falling in love with me.

600
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,533
You are making me dizzy.

601
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,367
Do you think he wanted to kiss me

602
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:22,033
or Gu Si Ren?

603
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,800
How would I know?

604
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,100
Why is fate toying with me like this?

605
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,934
You call this fate toying with you?

606
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:34,367
This is all because of you.

607
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:53,166
You...

608
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:05,933
You...

609
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:12,100
You...

610
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,500
You just got back?

611
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:16,733
Oh,

612
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,633
I came back this afternoon.

613
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,567
Oh.

614
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:31,833
You...

615
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:33,633
Are you going out this late?

616
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:34,900
Yes.

617
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:49,467
What are you doing tomorrow morning?

618
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,433
Nothing.

619
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:02,500
Then

620
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,934
do you want to go exercise together?

621
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,266
Oh,

622
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:08,400
okay.

623
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,233
Okay.

624
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,333
I'm going to the room.

625
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,300
Oh.

626
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,667
You go that way.

627
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:55,333
It is so frustrating.

628
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:12,767
Hero.

629
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:19,133
Hero.

630
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,400
I really want him to love me.

631
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:33,467
But I'm also scared of him falling in love with me.

632
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:48,300
I really want to know what Hero is thinking.

633
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:52,567
Whatever,

634
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,500
as long as I can get Hero to kiss me

635
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,200
and keep this body

636
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:58,533
then I can tell Hero the truth

637
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:00,100
that I am his favorite Lan Si.

638
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:05,400
That's right.

639
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:08,533
Who made the mess?

640
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:20,934
Tuck me up.

641
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:29,667
Time for a bedtime story.

642
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,033
Time takes everything.

643
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:38,700
Learning to be alone early might not be a bad thing.

644
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:42,500
However, ever since I met that person,

645
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:46,367
even if everyday is a struggle,

646
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:49,667
it feels like the world seems brighter.

647
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,266
Only when I think about her,

648
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:54,900
I can feel my heart beat and

649
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,667
I have a reason to live again.

650
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,333
I'm not comfortable with this.

651
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,633
It is so soppy.

652
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:11,666
Actually, Gu Si Ren is pretty unlucky.

653
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,900
He finally found a girl who likes him

654
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,467
but he died.

655
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,900
Everyday, I bring her breakfast.

656
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,334
When I watch her eat happily,

657
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,500
I feel happy too.

658
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:32,233
I spent all my money on a pair of bracelets today.

659
00:41:33,266 --> 00:41:34,800
It is a matching pair.

660
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,567
I'm going to tell her how I feel and

661
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:37,800
give her the gift in person.

662
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,867
She promised to meet me after class tomorrow.

663
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:48,266
She must know how I feel.

664
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,100
That is it?

665
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I wonder

666
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,767
what type of girl would like him.

667
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,367
I don't know if he got to tell her his feeling.

668
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,533
It doesn't matter now.

669
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,667
He is dead anyways.

670
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,133
Whether or not he succeeded,

671
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:15,100
it doesn't matter now.

672
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:21,167
It really troubles me.

673
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,867
You... What are you doing here?

674
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:31,867
Sleep.

675
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,033
Sleep.

676
00:42:33,733 --> 00:42:35,133
If you keep sleeping then you only have

677
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:38,200
68 hours 3 minutes and 25 seconds.

678
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,100
Go to sleep.

679
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,800
Okay...

680
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,967
I got it.

681
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:34,633
Thanks.

682
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:35,667
Hey,

683
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,266
you two are really hard to find.

684
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,300
Oh yeah.

685
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,100
I'm here today

686
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,500
because I want to show you this video.

687
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,700
It is hilarious.

688
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,633
It's a doll that can repeat what you say.

689
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,533
Happy new year!

690
00:45:50,533 --> 00:45:51,633
Super!

691
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,333
What is that?

692
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,367
It is so cute.

693
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,900
It is really stupid.

694
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,134
No, it's not.

695
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,300
I hate dolls that can repeat what you say,

696
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,233
you know what I mean?

697
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:02,967
Class is starting.

698
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,434
The teacher will take attendance

699
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:15,166
The teacher will take attendance

700
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:16,133
and he is very strict about it.

701
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:17,134
Hurry.

702
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:20,266
Let's go.

703
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:21,433
Mei Hero let's go.

704
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:45,734
What are you reading?

705
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,967
I want one.

706
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,867
Things with Hero today

707
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,800
went surprisingly well.

708
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,567
It looks like tonight is my chance.

709
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:15,967
I'm going for it.

710
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:38,900
Hero.

711
00:51:12,266 --> 00:51:12,967
Good morning.

712
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:14,734
Morning.

713
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:24,600
Why do you have this?

714
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,333
You seemed like you really liked it.

715
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:38,533
Mei Hero.

716
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,900
Thank you.

717
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:48,400
I love it.

718
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:05,767
A foreign secretary general has stated

719
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:09,100
a gay man will have

720
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,500
over 1000 sexual partners in his lifetime.

721
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:14,034
That is crazy.

722
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:15,100
Is it true?

723
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,033
Yes, it is really crazy.

724
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,634
How can you have 1000 sexual partners?

725
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:33,700
If I had a son in the future,

726
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,533
I think

727
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:36,367
I would not want him to be gay.

728
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:39,900
Since it is very difficult

729
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,600
for gays to be themselves in society now.

730
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,133
Think about it,

731
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:47,366
how can two men

732
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:49,367
hold hands,

733
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:50,700
hug,

734
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,900
or kiss on the street?

735
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:55,867
There is enough pressure

736
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:57,967
just from the way others look at you.

737
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:02,967
If it was lesbians, maybe it's okay.

738
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,334
What do you think?

739
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,166
I'm not done yet.

740
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:14,867
Leave the dishes.I will clean up later.

741
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:16,834
Leave the dishes.I will clean up later.

742
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:24,767
What's wrong?

743
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:28,467
I thought about it.

744
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:30,133
Maybe we should keep some distance between us,

745
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:31,867
in case people misunderstand our relationship.

746
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:32,867
Yesterday, didn't we—

747
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:35,067
Nothing happened yesterday.

748
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,034
Hero,

749
00:53:40,034 --> 00:53:41,933
can you not be so sensitive?

750
00:53:41,933 --> 00:53:44,400
If I said something wrong, I apologize.

751
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,533
We were just chatting.

752
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:47,300
You're right.

753
00:53:49,034 --> 00:53:51,700
Two grown men should not act like that.

754
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:55,566
Hero, that is not what I meant.

755
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,033
Do you not see our situation clearly?

756
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:00,200
We are both men.

757
00:54:15,433 --> 00:54:19,067
What if I'm not a man?

758
00:54:25,834 --> 00:54:28,266
You must have sensed something.

759
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:32,800
Come on,

760
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,733
you can not say you don't feel anything.

761
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,320
Sense what?

762
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:42,800
Mei Hero,

763
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,333
don't you think I look like someone?

764
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,567
We have spent so many days together and you haven't realized?

765
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:47,500
We have spent so many days together and you haven't realized?

766
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,234
That is ridiculous.

767
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:53,800
You do

768
00:54:55,967 --> 00:54:58,266
remind me of someone.

769
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,933
But…

770
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:02,800
I do not want to talk about her because it is all in the past.

771
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,667
I do not want to talk about her because it is all in the past.

772
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,900
What?

773
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,900
I am not looking for the shadow of someone as a substitute.

774
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,800
The thing I want to deal with now is—

775
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,034
Mei Hero, you idiot.

776
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:20,266
Why did you call me that?

777
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:21,967
How can you act like this?

778
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:22,967
What did I do?

779
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:24,266
I have done so much for you.

780
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:25,867
How can you treat me like this?

781
00:55:25,867 --> 00:55:26,867
Calm down, Gu Si Ren. Listen to me.

782
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:29,033
You listen to me.

783
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:31,167
I have tried to become closer to you, to make you happy,

784
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:31,867
I have tried to become closer to you, to make you happy,

785
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:33,067
to spend time with you,

786
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:35,466
all because I like you.

787
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:36,467
Now you throw it all away

788
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,833
because of the past?

789
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:40,134
How can you do that?

790
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:41,000
What I'm trying to say is—

791
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,967
Enough.

792
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:44,633
I have had enough.

793
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,700
I give up, okay?

794
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,400
Why are you not speaking today?

795
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,067
Strange.

796
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:49,734
He said

797
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:52,100
he doesn't want to talk about me anymore.

798
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,100
You?

799
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,100
Lan Si or Gu Si Ren?

800
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:05,366
He said it is all in the past.

801
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:09,733
You are being weird.

802
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,600
Are you sure he recognized you?

803
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:39,700
If in Hero's mind,

804
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,834
I am in the past.

805
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,300
I might as well be dead.

806
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:48,900
You're being too negative.

807
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,667
We have worked so hard for so long.

808
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,734
You can't be thinking about quitting now.

809
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:01,834
I do not know anymore.

810
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:07,134
If it was not for you,

811
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:09,200
I would not be dead.

812
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,567
What is this?

813
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,867
It is in every notebook.

814
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:43,500
I did not know

815
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,067
the "her" in Gu Si Ren's journal

816
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:49,433
is Hero.

817
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:52,700
Hero, who you believed loved you

818
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,633
did not even shed a tear

819
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:56,466
when you died.

820
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,533
That is because men do not cry.

821
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:02,433
What do you know?

822
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,467
Okay,

823
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,200
that is enough.

824
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,067
You can have it.

825
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,100
Are you happy now?

826
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,333
Very happy.

827
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:32,233
I don't know if you Lan Si and you

828
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:34,867
used to play games together like this?

829
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,734
Why do you ask?

830
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,933
I do not want to talk about her now.

831
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:44,800
Strange.

832
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,500
You talk like you know.

833
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,467
You never dated Lan Si.

834
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:49,467
Do you know how suffocating

835
01:00:49,467 --> 01:00:50,834
the type of love where

836
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:52,133
you impose your thoughts on the other person is?

837
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:52,967
Okay.

838
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,066
Mei Hero,

839
01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:55,600
Lan Si is dead now.

840
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,400
You are free.

841
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:08,534
Mei Hero,

842
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:11,867
you are out of line.

843
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:18,034
Why did you lie to me?

844
01:01:18,034 --> 01:01:21,534
Why did you not tell me?

845
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,033
Mei Hero...

846
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:53,133
Why did you lie to me?

847
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:33,534
Gu Si Ren, wake up.

848
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,400
Quickly, Gu Si Ren.

849
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,133
Gu Si Ren. we're going to be late for class.

850
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:42,100
Gu Si Ren, we're going to be late for class.

851
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,667
Strange,

852
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:52,733
where did he go this early in the morning?

853
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,466
Time takes everything.

854
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:27,200
Learning to be alone early might not be a bad thing.

855
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,000
However, ever since I met him,

856
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,900
even if everyday is a struggle,

857
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:39,000
the world seems brighter.

858
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,967
Only when I think about him,

859
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:44,600
I feel my heart beating.

860
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,366
I feel my heart beating.

861
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:51,867
I ran into him on the balcony again today.

862
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:54,766
He put his arm around my shoulders and said

863
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:58,100
if you're sad, you should cry and let it out.

864
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:07,700
At that moment, all my sadness disappeared.

865
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:15,066
I spent all my money on a pair of bracelets today.

866
01:05:15,066 --> 01:05:16,866
It is a matching pair.

867
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,500
I'm going to tell him how I feel and

868
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,700
give him the gift in person.

869
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,667
He promised to meet me after class tomorrow.

870
01:05:28,567 --> 01:05:30,967
He must know how I feel.

871
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:39,000
Everyday, I bring him breakfast.

872
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,333
When I watch him enjoy the food,

873
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:44,500
I feel happy too.

874
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,466
Princess,

875
01:06:11,466 --> 01:06:12,834
what are you doing here?

876
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:14,467
Your time is almost up.

877
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:15,900
You only have three minutes left.

878
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,034
Will you stop feeling sorry for yourself?

879
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:19,667
You think I want to?

880
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,867
Besides, I am not going to get a true love's kiss.

881
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:26,300
I am doomed.

882
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,667
Who said you are doomed?

883
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:07,967
Thank you for taking the first step

884
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:10,200
and helping me clear up the confusion in my mind.

885
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,300
With your love

886
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,000
and companionship,

887
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,433
I had the courage to find myself.

888
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:18,134
Why is it spinning for so long?

889
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,967
Is something wrong?

890
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,300
Hero,

891
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,367
what happened?

892
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:17,733
Gu Si Ren,

893
01:09:19,466 --> 01:09:21,467
I like you.

894
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:23,567
I thought about it.

895
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:25,534
I want to be with you.

896
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:27,867
We…

897
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:29,700
Why are we here?

898
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,333
You scared me.

899
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,133
So, the TV shows were right.

900
01:09:53,133 --> 01:09:56,166
So, the TV shows were right.

901
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,600
In relationships,

902
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,334
the one who is not loved is the third wheel.

903
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:11,360
7 days ago

904
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:43,233
What are you doing?

905
01:10:50,633 --> 01:10:52,100
Gu Si Ren,

906
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,633
are you okay?

907
01:10:53,633 --> 01:10:54,233
Wake up.

908
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:55,500
Wake up.

909
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,767
Hey.

910
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,000
Hero, something happened to Lan Si.

911
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,633
I will be right there.

912
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:09,200
Will you be okay?

913
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:57,500
[The End]
