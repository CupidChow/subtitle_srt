1
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,513
 

2
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:01,533
Hey, lighten up.

3
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,333
We're here for a meeting*.
(A group blind date)

4
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,773
Not a funeral.

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,973
O-Okay.

6
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:10,503
Let me borrow that.

7
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:26,043
You look alive now.

8
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:27,673
Thanks.

9
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:32,703
I feel carsick right now.

10
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,473
My heart is pounding, too.

11
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:36,763
Do you hear it?

12
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:41,123
Yeah. Your heart is about to explode.

13
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:45,383
Chew on this.

14
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:47,883
To ease your nerves.

15
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:50,093
Control your mind. Got it?

16
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,463
"Bring it on, World!"

17
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:58,253
"No amount of anxiety makes any difference

18
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:02,130
- to anything that is going to happen."

19
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,240
What?

20
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:04,613
Alan Watts.

21
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:07,233
It's a quote by a British philosopher.

22
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,620
Ready to go.

23
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,933
Unnis, we're all friends from
the same class starting now.

24
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,833
We're going in.

25
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:53,163
 Jong Hui. 

26
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:57,733
 Sometimes, I regret that day. 

27
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:03,773
 What if we hadn't gone to the meeting that day? 

28
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:09,023
 If three coincidences happen, they call it fate. 

29
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:13,903
 What if I hadn't held on to my trembling heart, 

30
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,933
 believing that perhaps 

31
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:21,053
 this person might be my destiny? 

32
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:31,343
Okay, then!

33
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:36,453
If I may introduce myself first,

34
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:38,263
I'm the pretty boy of Jeongshin High

35
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:40,753
and in charge of visuals. I'm Ma Sang Cheol.

36
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,633
And this is...

37
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,933
Jae Pil. Say something.

38
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:52,253
Han Jae Pil.

39
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:56,593
Yes! One can say he's in charge of charisma,

40
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:59,893
reserve, and toughness of Jeongshin High.

41
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,593
Right?

42
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,853
Yes.

43
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,663
I'm Son Ju Wan. Good at
everything except studying.

44
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,033
Our Ju Wan.

45
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,763
I'm equipped with that elusive
thing called normalcy.

46
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,253
Call me Choi Sang Mook.

47
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,113
Sang Mook, yes.

48
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:17,693
I arranged this meeting. My name is Lee Ju Kyeong.

49
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:21,913
I'm Ju Kyeong's friend, Kim Mi Ae.

50
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,023
I-I'm...

51
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:26,813
"I go all in, no matter what!"*
(Go and Ko sound the same)

52
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,663
Ko Yeong Rye.

53
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,453
I'm Seo Jong Hui.

54
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,993
I'll drop the honorifics since
we're all around the same age.

55
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:37,653
Huh? Oh! Sure. Whoa.

56
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,933
You're very straightforward.

57
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,563
Then, should I drop the mic instead of honorifics?

58
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:53,483
Gosh, I was just joking. A joke.

59
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:57,383
Jae Pil, I think just need
to avoid that young woman.

60
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:03,673
How about we choose partners without wasting time?

61
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:06,243
The men can all close their eyes.

62
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:08,763
Place one personal item on the table. Anything.

63
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:10,303
Sure.

64
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,343
Jae Pil. Choose wisely.

65
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:19,183
Close your eyes.

66
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,603
All right. You can open your eyes.

67
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:51,843
This is neat.

68
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:57,423
Whoa, this is nice.

69
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:04,013
Jae Pil, you need to choose, too.

70
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:17,233
 If the fate's arrow had ultimately
left a scar on me that day, 

71
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:22,873
 and if I had realized that it would cast me
into an unexpected storm… 

72
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:26,503
 Then, what might have unfolded? 

73
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:32,953
 

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:44,050


75
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:51,133
Well, your personal items somewhat
contradict the impressions you give off.

76
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:55,793
I thought the gum was yours,
and the pen was yours.

77
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,503
Why?

78
00:06:57,503 --> 00:07:01,173
Do I look like I've chewed gum in my days?*
(The phrase expresses delinquency)

79
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,503
Oh, no! You don't.

80
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:06,903
That's not what I meant.

81
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:10,053
Jae Pil, didn't you have something
to tell me? Yes.

82
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:13,393
You did. You did.

83
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,003
Pil, she scares me.

84
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:18,173
She's too fierce, just like my mom.

85
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,383
You said your ideal type was
someone like your mom.

86
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,313
That she's resilient and awesome.

87
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:24,563
T-That's what I thought.

88
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,213
But she beats up my dad.

89
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,333
I'm the witness.

90
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,983
Whatever. I'm going to wing it and leave.
You clearly said only one hour.

91
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,173
Hey, hey! Wait.

92
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:38,563
I'll clean the boxing gym
for the entire week. All of it.

93
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:42,053
This week? Or this month?

94
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:44,523
Hey, you petty bastard!

95
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,043
I'm going to kill you one day.

96
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:47,223
A month.

97
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:49,953
Hey, should the four of us hang out together?

98
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:53,033
I know a hot roller-skating rink. Let's go there.

99
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:55,833
- Sure.
- Okay.

100
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,840
That's fine, right?

101
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,583
Carsick again?

102
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,913
Yeah.

103
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:27,083
Pardon me. I'm going to open the window.

104
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:43,193
Wait.

105
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,723
Since the roller rink is near Angang Market,

106
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:48,883
should we transfer to the 100-1 at the next stop?

107
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:51,463
- I'll ask the attendant-
- No, the 100-1 doesn't stop there.

108
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:55,163
The 100-1 stops at Joongang Park,
Youngkwang Church, Cheongah Intersection,

109
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:57,763
Cheongah Elementary school,
Jeongshin High, Wonhwasa Entrance,

110
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:00,233
Wonhwa Health Center, and the intersection
at City Hall, before turning back.

111
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:04,433
It stops for five minutes before going back
until it reaches the bus depot.

112
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,963
Wow, you're awesome.

113
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,193
How did you memorize all that?
As if you're a bus attendant.

114
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:14,733
Oh! Her hobby is memorizing bus stops. Right?

115
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,763
Yeah. I-It is.

116
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:18,293
I bet she can memorize anything.

117
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:20,353
What else did you memorize?

118
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:22,073
- Me?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:25,113
"Because the language of our country
is different from that of China,

120
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:28,833
the spoken and the written words do not correspond.

121
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:33,573
Therefore, the uneducated common people,
though they wish to express themselves,

122
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,936
cannot do so with ease…"

123
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,423
What was that?

124
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,153
The Hunminjeongeum Haeryebon.*
(Manuscript on Use of Hangul, written Korean)

125
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,513
Whoa! As expected. You're the best.

126
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:51,553
Guys, we should get off at the next stop.

127
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:54,083
I think we need to transfer to the 99.

128
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:36,543
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:10,253
If you land wrongly, you'll break your tailbone.

130
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,563
That's at least a three-week recovery.

131
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,753
Thanks.

132
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:18,243
But... But I'm fine!

133
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,733
Maybe because I like dried anchovies,

134
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:24,073
but I have some strong bones.

135
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:25,873
Oh, really?

136
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,483
By the way...

137
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,223
haven't we met somewhere before?

138
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:43,413
No! No, we haven't.

139
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:46,873
I've never seen you before.

140
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,543
I really have not seen you before.

141
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,223
There's no need to be that serious.

142
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:57,063
Your laces are untied.

143
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:16,873
Should I just tie them for you?

144
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:38,763
All done.

145
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:44,303
T-Thanks.

146
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:53,623
Hey, don't you think I'm on fire today?

147
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:55,353
It's your first time at a rink, huh?

148
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,653
You want me to teach you?

149
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,823
No, I'm good.

150
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:01,333
I'll practice on my own.

151
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,833
Okay.

152
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,423
By the way, your collar...

153
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,453
Thank you.

154
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,633
Anyway, where's Jong Hui?

155
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,493
Oh, my partner?

156
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,743
Over there.

157
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,993
She's flying solo.

158
00:13:57,813 --> 00:13:59,793
Hey, why aren't you roller skating?

159
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:01,263
Hey!

160
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,693
You'll end up in the Olympics for roller skating.

161
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:08,023
You're a new face.

162
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:09,823
Let's see.

163
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:11,203
Youngshin Girls' High?

164
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:13,833
Or Hwaran?

165
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,403
I have no reason to answer.

166
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:18,753
You're in my way, so move aside.

167
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:21,393
Hey, why so uptight?

168
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,623
You're obviously one of our kind.

169
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:26,563
- Let's play together. 
 - Your kind, my ass.

170
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:31,443
Hey. I said you're in my way, so get lost.

171
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:35,443
Shit.

172
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,773
J-Jong Hui!

173
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:41,323
Oh, my. Sorry.

174
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:45,023
You should've accepted our invitation.
Why play hard-to-get?

175
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,613
Hey.

176
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:50,623
You can play with this, you halfwits.

177
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,283
Hey. Halfwits? Did you just call us halfwits?

178
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:57,633
Yeah. Want me to say it again?

179
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,493
Half. Wits.

180
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:02,873
- You want to die?
- Hey, you punks!

181
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:10,593
Eat this!

182
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:31,213
- Hey.
- What?

183
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,763
- Run.
- What?

184
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:34,503
I said, run.

185
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:39,633
- Hey, catch them!
- Come back here!

186
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:44,753
 

187
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,823
- Oh, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

188
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,173
Enjoy yourselves.

189
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:52,203
Her dumplings are really good.

190
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,853
It's not like anywhere else.

191
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,183
Let's dig in.

192
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:58,003
Thanks for the food. Let's eat.

193
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,613
I'm sorry I got you into trouble.

194
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:10,913
They would've picked a fight with someone anyway.

195
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:13,403
That's why they were there in the first place.

196
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,333
By the way, you were so cool back there.

197
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,453
You hurled that extinguisher
like it was a grenade.

198
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:25,593
I don't even know how to use that.

199
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:30,143
I did some studying because I wanted
to get certified in fire safety.

200
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:32,883
Fire safety certification?

201
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,033
Why?

202
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:36,643
Just in case.

203
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:42,533
But the test requirements were strict, so I gave up.

204
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,623
You're so unique.

205
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:49,523
You must've been really hungry. Take mine.

206
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,173
It's okay. You can have it.

207
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:55,193
It's fine. I'm not hungry due to the earlier shock.

208
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:57,493
You can have mine, too.

209
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:00,433
Then, I'll take it since we shouldn't waste food.

210
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,733
- Jong Hui!
- Yeah?

211
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,223
I think we're very late.

212
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:24,610
When did it get this late?

213
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:27,660
Sorry. We're leaving first.

214
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:35,443
Today was fun. Honestly.

215
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:38,803
- Hey. W-Wait. Hey!
- Bye.

216
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,933
They just left?

217
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,733
Not even a second date request?
I couldn't even ask for her phone number.

218
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,843
Do you even plan to see her again?

219
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:56,333
I thought you were scared of your partner.

220
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,133
Your partner. Not my partner.

221
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:01,373
You'd better not be interested.
You don't, don't you?

222
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,803
Yeah.

223
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:06,203
Not really.

224
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:11,103
But she is quirky and cute.

225
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,873
Exactly! That's exactly it.

226
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:18,143
My ideal type is a quirky and cute girl.

227
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:24,423
 

228
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,360
It's Ms. Kye's bedtime soon.

229
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,933
Let's go in when the lights go off.

230
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,003
Sure, let's do that.

231
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:53,873
You're holding me too tight.

232
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,883
I know you like it.

233
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,703
Let's see.

234
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:08,193
My Ms. Kwon. Your eyes are so pure.

235
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:11,083
They're like the night ocean reflecting the moon.

236
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,733
Hae Ja, do you know yoon seul?

237
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:16,924
Yoon Seul?

238
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:19,304
Who the hell is that bitch?

239
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,283
You're so cute.

240
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:24,743
Yoon seul.*
(Glittering ripples on water)

241
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,533
The night ocean reflecting the moon.

242
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,033
Hae Ja, your eyes shine like it.

243
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,943
Gosh, come on!

244
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:33,433
Don't ever stop that!

245
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:34,933
What are you saying?

246
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:38,333
Let me see the moonlight one more time.

247
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:51,113
Let's go. Let's go!

248
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:53,783
Just a little more. A little more!

249
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:59,583
Gosh, I don't know if this will work.

250
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,773
It's been so long.

251
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:05,603
Last until the first snowfall, okay?*
(Love will come true if the color lasts until then)

252
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:09,973
I'll get myself a man before then, no matter what.

253
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:12,243
As if!

254
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,513
Anyway, what time is it?

255
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,003
Why aren't the girls back from school?

256
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:18,833
You're right.

257
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,923
Come here. Come join us, too.

258
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,213
- We're staining our fingernails.
- What took you so long?

259
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:27,373
That's not important right now.

260
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:30,143
You'd die from shock if we told
you what we just saw.

261
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:31,843
You'd die from shock.

262
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:36,163
- Why? What is it?
- What did you see?

263
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:38,673
Unni!

264
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:43,483
No! Continue what you were doing.

265
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,173
Keep on reading.

266
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:47,313
Continue.

267
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,953
Hey. What are you waiting for, you punks?

268
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:52,873
Hae Ja must be tired. Lay out her blankets.

269
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:55,393
Hey, youngest.

270
00:20:55,903 --> 00:20:58,703
Ok Hui. I have hands, too.

271
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:01,703
I can lay out my own blankets.

272
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:04,003
Keep doing what you were doing.

273
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:14,073
Staining your nails with balsam
flowers would be so pretty.

274
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,643
Sorry! Continue what you were doing.

275
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,273
Sorry.

276
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,393
What the heck?

277
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,453
- Did she eat something that went bad?
- Hey!

278
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:26,473
I want to stain my nails, too.

279
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:29,013
No, thank you. I'm good.

280
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:37,443
 

281
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,543
 Should I tie them for you? 

282
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,003
 

283
00:22:58,263 --> 00:23:01,953
Damn. That wench, Su Ryeon.

284
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:05,383
Look at that wench hitting on Mr. Kim!

285
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:09,393
Look at that flat-chested girl wearing
a shirt so start to get his attention.

286
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:13,903
Unni. It's "tight," not "start."

287
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:15,813
Whatever!

288
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:19,333
Keep a close eye on her for the time being.

289
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:23,433
Especially if you see her making
a move on Mr. Kim.

290
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,273
Drop everything and let me know right away.

291
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,993
Yeah, I will.

292
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,353
Salt! He's shaking salt for her.

293
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:32,763
Shit!

294
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:35,333
The cook made it too watery today.

295
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,803
What's so good about that sleazy womanizer?

296
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,273
I just don't understand it.

297
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:46,613
Why not? He's still nice-looking.

298
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,733
He's the easiest on the eyes
at Cheongah Transportation.

299
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,863
And honey drips from his tongue.

300
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:57,133
Aigoo. Give me a truckload
of buttery guys like him

301
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:58,483
I wouldn't even look.

302
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:00,953
I don't like butter, either.

303
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,603
What about you, Yeong Rye?

304
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:05,413
Huh?

305
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:14,383
I prefer margarine over butter.

306
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,703
- What are you saying?
- You must still be half asleep.

307
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:23,353
Forget butter. She needs a taste of battering.

308
00:24:29,423 --> 00:24:31,153
Whoa!

309
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,923
Ms. Cha, you're riding in my bus today?

310
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:38,563
I got so lucky.

311
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,013
What do you mean?

312
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,193
You're the cutest girl at Cheongah Transportation.

313
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:46,703
Anyway,

314
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:52,863
your eyes are so pure from up close.

315
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,733
By any chance,

316
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:01,173
do you know yoon seul?

317
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:05,313
What's that?

318
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:08,993
They shine like the night ocean

319
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:11,083
reflecting moonlight.

320
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:18,183
 No! Mr. Kim is Hae Ja's man. 

321
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:25,973
I'm so jealous of the man who gets to date you.

322
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,943
He can look at your eyes all day.

323
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:39,263
 I really shouldn't! Mr. Kim is off limits. 

324
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:41,683
When is our final dispatch?

325
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:44,663
Do you want to watch a late-night movie with me?

326
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:53,713
 

327
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:03,113
Coach!

328
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:14,493
All that to just save on repair costs for the sign.

329
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:16,443
Look at me now.

330
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,833
Looks like my hospital bill will cost more.

331
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,483
Thank goodness. It could've been worse.

332
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:24,543
- What if you had hurt your head? 
- You're right.

333
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:27,513
You should save on things worth saving.

334
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:30,863
Coach, you're not really the type to make money.

335
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:32,953
Your bowl is too small.*
(Doesn't have what it takes)

336
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:35,593
Say what, you punk? Hey!

337
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,953
Darn it.

338
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,933
You think I don't have my reasons?

339
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,023
The number of members keeps
dwindling, and now it looks like

340
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:49,300
I won't even be able to pay the rent this month.

341
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,600
Given my situation, how can I
pay to repair the sign?

342
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,633
What's with those looks of pity?

343
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,343
You don't have to look at me like that.

344
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:03,523
There are ups and downs
when it comes to businesses.

345
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:08,063
As a matter of fact, I ordered
some flyers to advertise.

346
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:13,013
I'll hand them out first and if that doesn't work, either...

347
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,483
Damn! Then, I'll shut down.

348
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:20,923
I'll just take jobs at construction sites
to feed my wife and kids.

349
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:24,713
- Coach!
- What? What? What?

350
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:26,443
Will flyers be enough?

351
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:30,373
Why don't you scale it up while you're at it?

352
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:34,873
I just got a fantastic idea just now.

353
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:36,883
Well, what idea?

354
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:38,923
Hosting an event match.

355
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:42,513
A mini tournament hosted by Giant Gym.

356
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:44,183
We can invite our acquaintances.

357
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,833
We can advertise around our school

358
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,333
to gather an audience and show them a match.

359
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,273
If we show them how fun and rewarding boxing is,

360
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:55,607
people are bound to get hooked.

361
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,853
What do you think?

362
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,033
- Hey.
- Yes?

363
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,283
So?

364
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:22,023
What's your true intention?

365
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:23,903
Intention?

366
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,373
Why would I have something like that?

367
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,733
Of course, there is.

368
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:31,100
I'll invite Yeong Rye to the event.

369
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,653
Let's say you do. Then, what?

370
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:37,053
You and I will fight. I'll win.

371
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:39,600
- I'll lose to you?
- Yeah.

372
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,463
Move.

373
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:45,953
Hey. I'm on another level and
a higher weight class.

374
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:47,613
That's the point.

375
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:49,973
I'm in a lower weight class,
but as soon as the match starts,

376
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:52,733
I'll knock you out in one!

377
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,403
Wouldn't you fall for me if you were a girl?

378
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:56,023
So, why would I do that?

379
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:58,073
Hey! Why ask something obvious?

380
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,343
That's outright match-fixing.

381
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:02,453
That goes against sportsmanship.

382
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:05,013
Man, it's not even an official match.

383
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:07,133
And it's been a while since your buddy...

384
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,813
It's embarrassing, but it's my first time.

385
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:12,953
At any rate! I created this opportunity

386
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:15,953
with my slow brain, so I could try dating.

387
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,873
- But you won't sacrifice this much?
- Yes.

388
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:21,143
Is this all our friendship means to you?

389
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:22,293
- This shallow?
- Yes.

390
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,053
This is all it means. I'm comfortable with this.

391
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,853
And don't even think about begging me.

392
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:31,343
Come on, Hyung!

393
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,173
He's so handsome.

394
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:40,333
Hey.

395
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,913
Oh! Hi.

396
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,953
He's so handsome.

397
00:29:45,463 --> 00:29:46,973
Hi.

398
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,624
There's a handsome guy right here.

399
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,477
Must we go to this extent? I'm leaving.

400
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:57,997
Hey! Hey. Hey.

401
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,467
No matter how shameless I am,

402
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,827
I can't do this alone. At a girls' high, no less.

403
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:03,587
Two can't do this, either.

404
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:05,237
All right! Just 30 more minutes.

405
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,867
- All right. Let go of me. How embarrassing.
- Just 30 minutes.

406
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,907
Did you hear that?

407
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,517
Hi.

408
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:13,387
They go here?

409
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:15,567
With no one here?

410
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:23,189
I've seen those faces somewhere before.

411
00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:26,997
Oh, that's-

412
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:28,927
That's them from yesterday, right?

413
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,157
Why did they come here?

414
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:38,387
L-Let's go.

415
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:40,327
W-Wait!

416
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:42,437
Aren't they all pretty much out?

417
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:43,637
Who knows.

418
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:45,467
Did you forget?

419
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:47,387
They think we attend the day class.

420
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,697
Right.

421
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:49,987
Others are all wearing uniforms.

422
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:53,627
You want us to be the only ones in plain clothes?

423
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:57,557
They must've left already. What do we do?

424
00:30:57,557 --> 00:30:59,837
What do you want me to do?

425
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:15,727
A boxing gym event?

426
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:19,497
Yes. They really want you to come
and said I must invite you.

427
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:21,967
He repeatedly emphasized "must."

428
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,337
They must've fallen head over heels for you guys.

429
00:31:24,337 --> 00:31:25,787
Really?

430
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:28,897
I didn't even talk much with my partner.

431
00:31:28,897 --> 00:31:30,727
Really?

432
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:35,887
Then, it must be Yeong Rye.

433
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:37,087
W-What?

434
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:38,697
The handsome one.

435
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,327
He must've fallen for Yeong Rye.

436
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,727
No wonder. He didn't say a thing,
coming all the way here.

437
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:46,317
His friend did all the talking.

438
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:48,337
You can't be your own barber.

439
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:49,997
Whoa...

440
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:52,277
I-I don't think that's the case.

441
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,007
I don't think so.

442
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,857
Whoa. Nice going, Ko Yeong Rye.

443
00:31:57,857 --> 00:32:00,527
No. It's not like that.

444
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:03,777
We'll be late for class. Let's go. Let's go.

445
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:07,317
Whoo-hoo! Dating!

446
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:10,267
Hey, your face got really red!

447
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:13,717
Today, we'll learn about Jeong Kwan Sa*.
(The definite article, "The.")

448
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,247
Jeong Kwan Sa.

449
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:18,697
The "Kwan" means crown.

450
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:23,790
By putting a crown on the article...

451
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,077
"I have a cat."

452
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,577
"The cat is clever."

453
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:39,800
The "A cat" is the indefinite article
we learned in our previous lesson.

454
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,267
It's one cat out of many cats.

455
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:44,547
But the cat appeared again.

456
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,057
That's why it's "The cat."

457
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:48,097
The cat is clever.

458
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:52,057
In the same sentence or conversation,

459
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:56,457
if the same word is used again,
you add "The" before it.

460
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,557
It will make that noun special...

461
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:01,167
 What are you thinking about? Han Jae Pil? 

462
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,707
Okay. Next sentence.

463
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:06,457
"London is the capital of England."

464
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:08,707
London is what?

465
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:10,287
The capital of England.

466
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:12,157
 Focus on the lesson! 

467
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:16,597
It means, "The capital of England."

468
00:33:16,597 --> 00:33:18,247
Okay. Moving on.

469
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,137
"I have been to the store."

470
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,987
I have...

471
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:25,727
We told you to rest this week.

472
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,537
No one can beat your stubbornness.

473
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:30,017
Aigoo, I'm fine.

474
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:33,087
There's no food for a lazy man.

475
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:35,517
I need to work to feed our family.

476
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:37,347
I'll take it easy.

477
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:40,017
If a customer sees that we're not here,
they'll think we've moved.

478
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,057
But still.

479
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:43,537
Hey, stop nagging her.

480
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:45,627
We finished setting up already.

481
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:48,027
But you need to keep your promise, Mother.

482
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,707
Only three hours, okay?

483
00:33:49,707 --> 00:33:51,947
All right. I won't, even if you ask me to.

484
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,257
Get going. You said you need to study.

485
00:33:54,257 --> 00:33:55,947
Only he needs to study.

486
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:59,047
- And you don't? 
 - I just use basic knowledge.

487
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:01,797
- Yeong Bae, you know how to tell time, right?
- Yes.

488
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:04,487
When the long hand goes around three times,

489
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:06,347
ask Mom to go home.

490
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:09,597
If Mom persists, say you'll tell on her.

491
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:10,847
You know what I mean, right?

492
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,137
Yes. I understand.

493
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,037
Aigoo, I understand. So that's enough.

494
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:16,087
Just help the kids up and leave.

495
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,397
- All right. Yeong Mi, which horse?
- The white one.

496
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:21,867
The white one. All right.

497
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,567
All set?

498
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:31,257
How is there not a single soul because we skipped a few days?

499
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:33,357
Damn it.

500
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:36,677
At this rate, I won't even get
to make my first sale.

501
00:34:43,117 --> 00:34:45,977
Whoa! I want to ride that, Mom.

502
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:48,207
- Ride what?
- That.

503
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:51,587
That does look fun.

504
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:53,047
Doesn't it?

505
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,307
But you shouldn't.

506
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:58,477
What if you ride it and happen to fall off?

507
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:00,657
The horse looks unstable.

508
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:02,887
Gosh, you can't.

509
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:10,137
But that looks so delicious.

510
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:13,007
- Doesn't it?
- I do want to try the bbopki.

511
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:15,127
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

512
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,087
- Eat this.
- Let's share.

513
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:19,757
Oh, but I shouldn't.

514
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:22,197
I already had cake for dessert today.

515
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:25,017
- I've had too much sugar. 
 - It's good.

516
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:27,507
Mr. Son, let's get going.

517
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:29,037
You need to go back to the office later.

518
00:35:29,037 --> 00:35:32,147
- I think she's almost done. I'll go now.
- I want to ride that!

519
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,837
You can't.

520
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,517
- Why not?
- You just can't.

521
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:38,257
But they're riding it.

522
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:40,797
Damn, that lady.

523
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:44,497
Why stare if she's not going
to get out of the car?

524
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:47,217
She got my hopes up. Geez.

525
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:48,757
Oh, my gosh. It's all burnt.

526
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:51,777
Shit. I hope she gets a flat tire.

527
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:00,767
The music ended.

528
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:04,077
What should I do...

529
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,787
Aigoo! You're here!

530
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:09,457
- Yeah. You're here?
- Hi!

531
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:12,547
Oh, my goodness.

532
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:15,437
You look totally wrecked in just a few days.

533
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:17,097
Should you be working like this?

534
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:19,757
Well, what choice do I have?

535
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:23,567
If I want to take care of my baby
chicks who keep asking for food,

536
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:25,447
I need to be okay even if I'm not.

537
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:27,777
But business is slow.

538
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:29,657
I haven't even made my first sale today.

539
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:32,647
Then, can you help me out in two days?

540
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:37,807
A group reservation was suddenly made, so I need help.

541
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:39,587
I came to ask just in case.

542
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:42,447
I'll give you a nice, hefty day's wage.

543
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,497
- Hefty?
- Of course.

544
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:46,167
How much?

545
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:49,447
A hefty amount! Gosh!

546
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:51,477
Join me.

547
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:14,667
Wake up.

548
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,487
 National exercise, start. 

549
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:33,597
 - One, two, three, four, 
- Straight posture.

550
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:36,647
 five, six, seven, eight. 

551
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:39,677
 Two, two, three, four, 

552
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:42,637
 five, six, seven, legs. 

553
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:45,627
 One, two, three, four, 

554
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:48,607
 five, six, seven, eight. 

555
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:51,517
 Two, two, three, four, 

556
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:54,307
 five, six, seven, torso. 

557
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:57,667
 One, two, three, four... 

558
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,267
You're going today, right?

559
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:03,197
 Two, two, three, four, 

560
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,937
The boxing gym.

561
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:07,707
Let's go. I think it'll be fun.

562
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:11,357
 Four, five, six, seven, eight. 

563
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:13,227
Well,

564
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:14,847
I'll see.

565
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,117
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

566
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:21,237
 One, two, three, four... 

567
00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:23,877
You're making a big deal.

568
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:26,397
It's not even a date.

569
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:30,167
Why? You said he invited you.

570
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,287
Then, it's practically a date.

571
00:38:32,287 --> 00:38:34,737
Tilt your head toward me.

572
00:38:34,737 --> 00:38:36,317
We need to finish this before our next dispatch.

573
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:39,267
- Look at me.
- I think pink looks good.

574
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:40,977
Don't you think her lashes are sagging?

575
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:42,567
Let me see.

576
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:44,937
Oh, my! They're sagging.

577
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:49,777
Yeah. Now that you mention it, I think it is.

578
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:51,427
Gosh!

579
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:54,117
What's that?

580
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:55,887
Okay...

581
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,660
Do this with your eyes.

582
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,510
Like this.

583
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:09,027
Huh? Like this.

584
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:14,297
I'm scared. It's like you're branding
me with a hot iron.

585
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:16,867
Come on. Just do this and
you'll look like Sophie Marceau.

586
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,897
If not, I swear on my life.

587
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,428
Ta-da!

588
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,696
Oh, wow!

589
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:25,267
She could enter a Miss Korea
pageant just like this.

590
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:28,335
Goodness. She's right.

591
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:30,437
Gosh, how pretty.

592
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:33,127
So pretty.

593
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:39,317
What is this?

594
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:42,337
I don't think it suits me.

595
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:48,715
Beautiful.

596
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:51,845
 

597
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,273
- Hello.
- Enjoy the match.

598
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,213
- Sure.
- Will do.

599
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,077
Enjoy the match.

600
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,252
This way. It's this way.

601
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:15,249
You look so bright. Okay, okay!

602
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:18,759
- Please enjoy the match. Thank you.
- Thank you.

603
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:21,307
Hey, wait. Wait.

604
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:24,747
I'll throw a jab first

605
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,413
and then an uppercut.

606
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,093
Put a little more soul into being
knocked out. Big actions!

607
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:36,413
You suck at acting.

608
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,573
Hey, they're here. They're here.

609
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,313
Over here!

610
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:46,443
H-Hi.

611
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,683
We meet again.

612
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:49,363
Yeah, hi.

613
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,233
Thanks for coming.

614
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:54,353
I almost didn't recognize you
without the uniforms.

615
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:58,213
I just dressed like I usually do.

616
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:01,943
D-Do I look awkward?

617
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:04,493
Not at all! You look pretty.

618
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:05,833
Prettier than Sophie Marceau.

619
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,623
I guess she won't have to swear on her life.

620
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:13,843
- Hi.
- Hey.

621
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:15,593
Hi.

622
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:19,953
- Should we head in?
- Yeah. Let's go in.

623
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,053
Let's go.

624
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:23,873
It might look a bit run-down,

625
00:41:23,873 --> 00:41:26,513
but it's nice inside.

626
00:41:26,513 --> 00:41:28,583
- Was it hard getting here?
- No.

627
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,053
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.

628
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:32,723
Okay, okay. Enjoy the match.

629
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,503
 

630
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:46,913
These are our seniors.

631
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:48,643
Yeong Rye, come in.

632
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:51,090
This is our gym.

633
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:53,953
This is our coach.

634
00:41:53,953 --> 00:41:55,363
- Hello.
- Hello.

635
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:56,550
What should we do?

636
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,920
Jin Tae can't make it because of an upset stomach.

637
00:41:58,923 --> 00:42:02,243
He went crazy yesterday and kept
eating undercooked meat.

638
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:05,143
I told him not to do that. That punk.

639
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:07,853
Then, what about Jin Tae and Sang Woon's match?

640
00:42:07,853 --> 00:42:09,493
We have no choice.

641
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,873
For now, we have to adjust the weight classes

642
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:14,513
and change the matchup.

643
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:16,537
Yes, we'll have to change the matchup.

644
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,587
Change the matchup?

645
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,593
Without further ado,

646
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:32,093
we'll start our first-ever match hosted by

647
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:35,063
Giant Boxing Gym! Make some noise!

648
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:42,453
All right, let's introduce our boxers!

649
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,833
On the red corner!

650
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:50,213
The pretty boy of Giant Boxing Gym!

651
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:55,123
Ma Sang Cheol!

652
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:04,453
So cool!

653
00:43:04,453 --> 00:43:06,523
Fighting!

654
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:10,663
Next is the blue corner!

655
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:16,313
The face of Giant Boxing Gym!

656
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:21,063
Jang Deok Goo!

657
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:19,943
That was a good punch!

658
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:44,003
Stop!

659
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:55,963
What the hell?

660
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:07,943
Stop.

661
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,193
That's enough.

662
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:27,743
Please stop.

663
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:58,814
 

664
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,043
Oh! Wait! Wait, please!

665
00:48:03,043 --> 00:48:05,203
I need medicine.

666
00:48:05,203 --> 00:48:08,293
The skin above his eye is lacerated.

667
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:12,693
Could I get something to apply to it?

668
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:14,093
Yes, come in.

669
00:48:14,093 --> 00:48:16,853
Thank you. I made it.

670
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:29,673
Are you okay?

671
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,013
Why wouldn't I be okay?

672
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:34,753
As you can see.

673
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:39,263
Why did you do that?

674
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,362
Why did you do that?

675
00:48:47,113 --> 00:48:48,743
Earlier.

676
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,371
I was scared.

677
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,755
That you might die.

678
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,636
I was scared.

679
00:49:34,963 --> 00:49:37,343
Jong Hui.

680
00:49:37,343 --> 00:49:39,943
- Let's go. It's late.
- Huh?

681
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:04,836
I overreacted earlier, didn't I?

682
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:09,273
No. Not even close.

683
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,369
But...

684
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:16,562
why did you do that?

685
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,813
No reason.

686
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:23,953
No reason?

687
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:27,793
Maybe I got riled up because of the blood?

688
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:33,304
I just hate to see blood, you know.

689
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:35,901
Really?

690
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:41,743
Actually, I'm like that, too.

691
00:50:41,743 --> 00:50:43,883
You know things that are thin and long?

692
00:50:43,883 --> 00:50:46,943
Like worms and snakes? I hate them.

693
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,573
- Really?
- Yeah.

694
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:50,553
I find them cute.

695
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:52,033
What?

696
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:59,663
Gosh, even so. I overreacted back there.

697
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:03,813
I made a big scene at someone else's match.
Didn't I?

698
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:08,014
It's okay. Forget it. It happens.

699
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:10,943
Let's go.

700
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:19,793
Whoa.

701
00:51:19,793 --> 00:51:22,413
So beautiful.

702
00:51:23,403 --> 00:51:25,353
Oh, that's so pretty.

703
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:28,103
I think it would suit me.

704
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,903
Unni, your soda.

705
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:36,923
I took too long, right? Sorry.

706
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:39,723
Yeah, you did take long.

707
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:41,393
Did you make it yourself?

708
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:44,673
The vending machine must be nuts.

709
00:51:44,673 --> 00:51:47,743
I put in money, but it didn't dispense anything.

710
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:52,113
I kicked it a couple of times,
went crazy, and barely got it.

711
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:54,513
Drink up.

712
00:51:54,513 --> 00:51:57,773
You bloody drink it, you traitor!

713
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:06,103
Unni, what's wrong?

714
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:08,303
What do you mean, traitor?

715
00:52:11,063 --> 00:52:13,963
Shit. Look at you act innocent.

716
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:20,260
I heard you watched a late-night
movie with Mr. Kim.

717
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:23,543
Jae Sook from next door said she saw you.

718
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:26,073
She said you were over the moon.

719
00:52:26,073 --> 00:52:29,083
You saw Mr. Kim just now, too, right?

720
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:31,253
Am I right?

721
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:32,843
Unni.

722
00:52:36,123 --> 00:52:38,983
Since when? Huh?

723
00:52:38,983 --> 00:52:42,183
Since when did you make a move on Mr. Kim?

724
00:52:42,183 --> 00:52:43,853
Right under my nose.

725
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:46,183
I treated you like a sister, you sly bitch!

726
00:52:46,183 --> 00:52:49,073
Unni! Please let go of me this once and talk.

727
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:51,043
Just this once.

728
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:54,673
Fine.

729
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:57,863
Let's talk this out.

730
00:52:57,863 --> 00:53:02,163
Take your time and explain yourself.

731
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:06,103
Did you think I'd say that, you traitor?

732
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:08,363
How could you do this to me?

733
00:53:08,363 --> 00:53:10,493
Oh, my gosh. Do something.

734
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:12,623
I can't. I can't.

735
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,783
Hey. Today will be the end for both of us.

736
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:18,333
- Today will be your funeral!
- What's going on?

737
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:20,443
Today will be your memorial day!

738
00:53:20,443 --> 00:53:21,593
What's wrong?

739
00:53:21,593 --> 00:53:23,213
What's wrong? Unni, what's going on?

740
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:25,963
Ko Yeong Rye, move. She's not even human.

741
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:28,083
You can't. Unni, calm down.

742
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:31,043
- I said, move! Why are you in my way?
- Take it easy-

743
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:32,543
Hey!

744
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,813
I said, move!

745
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:38,153
- Stop! Stop! What are you doing?
- Shit!

746
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:40,743
Where did you come from? Hey!

747
00:53:40,743 --> 00:53:42,233
Move!

748
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:45,423
 

749
00:53:51,203 --> 00:53:55,353
Want to join me at the pub for a shot of soju?

750
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:58,043
Everyone is working overtime.

751
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:06,803
 ♫ Nililiya, nilili ♫ 

752
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:10,923
 ♫ Nilili mambo ♫ 

753
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:14,773
 ♫ That young lady is a troublemaker ♫ 

754
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:18,553
 ♫ Troublemaker mambo ♫ 

755
00:54:18,553 --> 00:54:22,513
 ♫ That ahjussi is a weasel ♫ 

756
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:26,313
 ♫ Weasel mambo ♫ 

757
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:30,713
 ♫ Overtime is how we make money ♫ 

758
00:54:30,713 --> 00:54:32,323
Excuse me...

759
00:54:33,223 --> 00:54:35,843
You should hurry over to Room 3.

760
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:37,493
Room 3? Why?

761
00:54:37,493 --> 00:54:39,863
- What's the problem?
- Hurry.

762
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,693
What the hell?

763
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,493
Hey, hey, hey!

764
00:54:50,493 --> 00:54:52,333
Everyone, stop moving!

765
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:55,083
Stop!

766
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,673
Set them up properly.

767
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:16,033
You're not here for a picnic.
You're getting punished.

768
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:19,343
I'd better not see a single mouse

769
00:55:19,343 --> 00:55:22,143
or I'll hang you guys on that mousetrap.

770
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:27,933
Why are we suffering because of them?

771
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:29,703
Setting up traps in the middle of the night.

772
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:31,723
That's what I'm saying.

773
00:55:31,723 --> 00:55:34,593
At any rate, I don't understand.

774
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:39,293
When it comes to men, a man like Byeon Gang Soe* is
(A lusty brute)

775
00:55:39,293 --> 00:55:41,303
better than a slick-looking one.

776
00:55:41,303 --> 00:55:45,463
Why do you think the aristocrat ladies fed
the farmhands mountains of rice?

777
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:47,711
Well, that's because they ate a lot.

778
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,550
You're wrong, little girl!

779
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:53,515
A man needs to be strong to go

780
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:57,403
back and forth from the watermill house.*
(A lovers' hideout)

781
00:55:57,403 --> 00:56:00,453
I hear little mice squeaking away!

782
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:02,913
Oh, a mouse! A mouse!

783
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:04,833
Mouse!

784
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:13,573
Where is it?

785
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:15,983
Yeah, you hit it!

786
00:56:15,983 --> 00:56:18,043
You hit it.

787
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:19,903
It's going!

788
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:21,381
- You hit it.
- I'm home.

789
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:23,631
- You're home?
- Oppa!

790
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:29,533
Wait a minute.

791
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:30,873
Wait, wait!

792
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:33,613
Oh, my gosh. What happened to your eye?
Did you get hurt?

793
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:37,023
- Oh, no.
- What do you mean no? Let me see.

794
00:56:37,023 --> 00:56:40,423
What should we do? On your handsome face, too!

795
00:56:40,423 --> 00:56:42,743
Stay right there. We need to
apply the ointment on it.

796
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:44,363
No, I'm-

797
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:47,093
Oppa.

798
00:56:47,093 --> 00:56:49,833
Did Dad punish you again?

799
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:52,243
No, it's not like that.

800
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,213
Let me see.

801
00:56:54,213 --> 00:56:55,983
Come here.

802
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:57,823
Huh?

803
00:56:57,823 --> 00:56:58,983
I'll do it.

804
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,503
Oh, sure. Here.

805
00:57:05,883 --> 00:57:08,623
- Thank you.
- Of course.

806
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:17,653
I squeezed out too much.

807
00:57:22,363 --> 00:57:25,913
Oppa! I'll treat you.

808
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,683
Will you, Doctor?

809
00:57:32,593 --> 00:57:34,163
All right.

810
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,063
Where does it hurt?

811
00:57:40,063 --> 00:57:41,613
Your eye?

812
00:57:41,613 --> 00:57:45,013
Yes. There's a cut here, Doctor.

813
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:46,673
It hurts so much.

814
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:48,763
Give me a moment.

815
00:57:56,513 --> 00:57:58,203
Doctor.

816
00:57:58,203 --> 00:58:00,563
Why are you listening to
my heart when my eye hurts?

817
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:02,643
You're supposed to.

818
00:58:02,643 --> 00:58:04,913
Just stay put, will you?

819
00:58:04,913 --> 00:58:06,913
I'm sorry.

820
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:13,833
 Stop! 

821
00:58:18,763 --> 00:58:21,043
 Please stop. 

822
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:28,383
Oppa.

823
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:31,143
Your heart is beating too fast.

824
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:35,083
 I was scared. 

825
00:58:38,553 --> 00:58:40,693
 That you might die. 

826
00:58:41,763 --> 00:58:43,493
 I was scared. 

827
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:47,293
It's beating faster now.

828
00:58:47,293 --> 00:58:48,953
Faster.

829
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:50,613
Even faster.

830
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:52,203
Even faster!

831
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,673
Goodbye.

832
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:08,683
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

833
00:59:17,343 --> 00:59:18,913
You're not leaving right away?

834
00:59:18,913 --> 00:59:21,343
The engine kept cutting off, so it's in repair.

835
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:23,353
It'll take about two or three hours.

836
00:59:23,353 --> 00:59:25,813
Lucky you. Guess you'll get to rest.

837
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:27,653
Good day.

838
00:59:37,823 --> 00:59:40,413
 

839
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:49,813
Did he get treated?

840
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,833
It might scar if he doesn't treat it.

841
01:00:18,273 --> 01:00:20,843
Yeah. No reason I can't give it to him.

842
01:00:20,843 --> 01:00:24,333
I can just say I bought it when
I passed by the pharmacy.

843
01:00:25,573 --> 01:00:26,883
I'm going to the gym.

844
01:00:26,883 --> 01:00:28,433
You're going boxing?

845
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:30,243
You should rest today.

846
01:00:30,243 --> 01:00:33,823
We also need to go to the Founding
Anniversary Sports Competition later.

847
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:36,443
It's tradition to go with your entire family.

848
01:00:36,443 --> 01:00:38,263
It'll look bad if you don't go.

849
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:40,373
I'll be quick.

850
01:00:40,373 --> 01:00:42,623
Where do you think you're going?
We need to leave in a bit.

851
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,313
Will you die if you skip boxing for a day?

852
01:00:45,313 --> 01:00:47,093
Why don't you study that hard?

853
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:49,503
Until you get blisters on your butt.

854
01:00:49,503 --> 01:00:50,973
You have a good head on your shoulders.

855
01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:52,113
I'm leaving.

856
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:53,943
If you can't make it on time, we'll leave first.

857
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:56,623
And we'll send Mr. Son to you.

858
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:58,793
See you later.

859
01:01:13,263 --> 01:01:14,733
Hey.

860
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:17,603
Your arms will fall off.

861
01:01:17,603 --> 01:01:21,033
Why are you warming up so extremely?

862
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:23,063
Are you mad about something?

863
01:01:23,903 --> 01:01:25,013
Hey.

864
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:26,603
What?

865
01:01:29,893 --> 01:01:31,493
Never mind.

866
01:01:35,503 --> 01:01:37,313
Hey, look.

867
01:01:39,293 --> 01:01:40,833
I mean.

868
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,793
What is it?

869
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:47,493
You really won't tell me?

870
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:49,973
I'll listen to you over a bowl of udon.

871
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:52,143
I have to wash my face and leave right away.

872
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:55,043
I don't even have time to wash my hair.
My father might kill me if I'm late.

873
01:01:55,043 --> 01:01:59,793
I might kill you before
your father does, you punk.

874
01:02:08,403 --> 01:02:10,583
I can't.

875
01:02:19,003 --> 01:02:20,823
Excuse me.

876
01:02:24,183 --> 01:02:27,293
Mom! I'm here.

877
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:29,003
Unni.

878
01:02:29,003 --> 01:02:31,863
Yeong Mi, you were eating?

879
01:02:31,863 --> 01:02:34,033
Yeah. I hate black beans.

880
01:02:34,033 --> 01:02:36,113
But we only have black beans.

881
01:02:36,113 --> 01:02:37,583
You should eat them.

882
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:40,313
They're very nutritious.

883
01:02:41,323 --> 01:02:43,793
Anyway, where's Mom?

884
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,763
It's not time to work yet.

885
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:48,543
Yeah. She's at Mokpo ahjumma's restaurant.

886
01:02:48,543 --> 01:02:50,783
Mokpo ahjumma's?

887
01:02:50,783 --> 01:02:52,653
Why would she go there?

888
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,933
I guess it's raining all day.

889
01:02:57,933 --> 01:03:01,223
At least, it started after all the
customers left. What's the worry?

890
01:03:01,223 --> 01:03:02,363
You'll be rich in no time.

891
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,723
What would I have done without you today?

892
01:03:04,723 --> 01:03:07,353
- I really appreciate it.
- Don't mention it.

893
01:03:22,663 --> 01:03:23,843
Mom!

894
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,673
- What brings you here?
- Mom!

895
01:03:25,673 --> 01:03:27,983
What are you doing here?

896
01:03:27,983 --> 01:03:30,463
You shouldn't be working.
But to work here, no less?

897
01:03:30,463 --> 01:03:32,493
Gosh, lower your voice.

898
01:03:32,493 --> 01:03:34,283
Did you swallow a steam train?

899
01:03:34,283 --> 01:03:35,713
For crying out loud.

900
01:03:35,713 --> 01:03:38,943
Why are you raising your voice
in someone's restaurant?

901
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:40,523
Mom!

902
01:03:40,523 --> 01:03:42,003
Stop making a fuss.

903
01:03:42,003 --> 01:03:43,293
Resting isn't in my destiny.

904
01:03:43,293 --> 01:03:46,673
Staying put at home makes me restless.

905
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:48,893
I don't dream of anything extravagant.

906
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:51,223
A few days of rest were enough.

907
01:03:51,223 --> 01:03:53,583
I'm fine. Go home.

908
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,033
- Go on.
- I'll do that.

909
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:56,783
Forget it-

910
01:03:57,453 --> 01:03:59,743
Mom! What's wrong? Are you okay?

911
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,233
I'm fine.

912
01:04:01,233 --> 01:04:03,843
Why wouldn't I be fine?

913
01:04:04,823 --> 01:04:05,853
Mom! Mom!

914
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:07,523
Mom, are you okay?

915
01:04:07,523 --> 01:04:10,303
Oh, my gosh! What happened?

916
01:04:19,413 --> 01:04:22,033
Taxi! Taxi!

917
01:04:25,813 --> 01:04:28,213
Mom, keep it together.

918
01:04:28,213 --> 01:04:32,093
Mom. Mom, you have to stay awake, okay?

919
01:04:35,293 --> 01:04:38,293
Mom, are you listening to me?

920
01:04:38,973 --> 01:04:40,643
Taxi!

921
01:04:43,653 --> 01:04:46,813
Mom. Mom! Mom!

922
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,083
What's wrong?

923
01:04:54,593 --> 01:04:57,703
Mom... My mom is...

924
01:04:57,703 --> 01:04:59,393
Get in.

925
01:05:31,413 --> 01:05:34,533
Mr. Son, hurry. Please speed up.

926
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:46,183
 

927
01:05:46,183 --> 01:05:51,243
 

928
01:06:21,193 --> 01:06:23,113
Try not to worry.

929
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,203
She'll be all right.

930
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:32,103
Shouldn't you get going?

931
01:06:32,103 --> 01:06:34,973
Can you stay here like this?

932
01:06:41,413 --> 01:06:44,013
Doctor. How...

933
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:47,063
Is my mom okay?

934
01:06:47,063 --> 01:06:48,913
Yes, the surgery went well.

935
01:06:48,913 --> 01:06:52,863
But did she have any falls recently?

936
01:06:52,863 --> 01:06:58,913
She tumbled down a hill recently and hurt herself.

937
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,823
She should've gone to a hospital to get examined.

938
01:07:02,823 --> 01:07:04,933
It seems that the minor bleeding
in the abdominal cavity

939
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,093
progressed to peritonitis.

940
01:07:07,093 --> 01:07:11,803
It's fortunate that it developed into pain,
so she could receive surgery.

941
01:07:11,803 --> 01:07:13,103
Thank you.

942
01:07:13,103 --> 01:07:16,083
Thank you. Thank you!

943
01:07:18,543 --> 01:07:20,363
Thank goodness.

944
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:25,483
Thank goodness...

945
01:07:36,003 --> 01:07:39,043
But why am I crying?

946
01:07:43,203 --> 01:07:44,683
I...

947
01:07:46,623 --> 01:07:48,973
I shouldn't cry.

948
01:07:51,433 --> 01:07:54,613
My siblings will arrive soon.

949
01:07:57,553 --> 01:08:03,163
They'll be scared if I'm crying.

950
01:08:05,023 --> 01:08:06,643
Sorry.

951
01:08:06,643 --> 01:08:16,443
 ♫ The dreams I wanted to reach slip further away ♫ 

952
01:08:16,443 --> 01:08:22,173
 ♫ And the day I can't hold onto,
at the end of my day ♫ 

953
01:08:22,173 --> 01:08:24,103
You can cry now.

954
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:33,533
 ♫ What's making it crumble? ♫ 

955
01:08:33,533 --> 01:08:40,893
 ♫ I don't know anything ♫ 

956
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:48,393
 ♫ Everything feels too hard
since it's the first time ♫ 

957
01:08:48,393 --> 01:08:55,893
 ♫ I can't throw a tantrum like a child ♫ 

958
01:08:55,893 --> 01:09:03,493
 ♫ I'm still a nobody ♫ 

959
01:09:03,493 --> 01:09:10,713
 ♫ I want to do everything well ♫ 

960
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:18,433
 ♫ But even I'm too much for myself ♫ 

961
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:26,013
 ♫ How much of me must I cast away? ♫ 

962
01:09:26,013 --> 01:09:33,223
 ♫ Before I can truly become me ♫ 

963
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:50,373
 ♫ While I go about my day,
which no one cares about ♫ 

964
01:09:54,953 --> 01:09:56,720
 Jong Hui. 

965
01:09:57,323 --> 01:09:59,340
 That was the third time. 

966
01:09:59,993 --> 01:10:03,573
 Not once. Not twice. 

967
01:10:11,143 --> 01:10:15,413
 ♫ Gently, tenderly ♫ 

968
01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:17,533
How's your mother?

969
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:19,143
She's all right.

970
01:10:19,143 --> 01:10:21,863
She woke up for a moment and fell back asleep.

971
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:24,803
Oh, thank goodness.

972
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,893
That's a relief.

973
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:31,993
 Crossing paths with him three times, 

974
01:10:31,993 --> 01:10:35,023
 I suppose I wanted to believe it was fate, 

975
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:40,913
 or perhaps even destiny. 

976
01:10:40,913 --> 01:10:46,103
 Since I always dreamed of a love destined by fate. 

977
01:10:46,103 --> 01:10:48,493
Today...

978
01:10:48,493 --> 01:10:51,533
Thank you so much for today.

979
01:10:51,533 --> 01:10:54,413
I know a drink doesn't even cut it,

980
01:10:54,413 --> 01:10:57,273
but this is all I can give you right now.

981
01:10:57,273 --> 01:10:59,853
This is fine.

982
01:11:12,443 --> 01:11:13,969
Shouldn't you...

983
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,073
really get going now?

984
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:18,943
No, it's fine.

985
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:23,426
There's my father's company's Founding
Anniversary Sports Competition.

986
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:27,533
But I honestly didn't want to go.

987
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:31,443
Oh, I'm so sorry. You couldn't go because of me.

988
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:39,875
You know...

989
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:42,234
Your friend?

990
01:11:42,234 --> 01:11:44,901
- Jong Hui?
- Y-Yeah.

991
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:46,883
Do you live in the same neighborhood?

992
01:11:46,883 --> 01:11:50,663
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

993
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:52,843
Oh, I see.

994
01:11:55,303 --> 01:11:57,433
You two seemed very close.

995
01:11:57,433 --> 01:12:00,623
Yeah. We are.

996
01:12:23,693 --> 01:12:26,183
Okay, then. I'll...

997
01:12:27,163 --> 01:12:28,483
get going.

998
01:12:28,483 --> 01:12:30,333
Thanks for the drink.

999
01:12:32,513 --> 01:12:37,283
 So, for a brief while, I was elated. 

1000
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:43,413
 So, I tried to muster up courage
I didn't even have. 

1001
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,860
- You-
- I-

1002
01:12:52,773 --> 01:12:55,773
- You go ahead.
- It's okay.

1003
01:12:56,443 --> 01:12:58,823
You go first.

1004
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:08,013
 If I hadn't urged him to speak first... 

1005
01:13:10,203 --> 01:13:15,103
 If I had handed him the medicine
that held my feelings... 

1006
01:13:22,636 --> 01:13:24,851
You know...

1007
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:26,371
Yeah.

1008
01:13:29,943 --> 01:13:31,533
Hold on.

1009
01:13:32,913 --> 01:13:35,033
Mr. Son, give me a moment.

1010
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:10,105
Here.

1011
01:14:20,827 --> 01:14:24,710
Can you give this to Seo Jong Hui?

1012
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:33,800


1013
01:14:34,543 --> 01:14:44,046
♫  Why do birds suddenly
appear every time you are near?  ♫

1014
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:51,108
 Would our story have been a bit different? 

1015
01:14:51,108 --> 01:14:54,833
 Do you think so, Jong Hui? 

1016
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:57,632
 My one and only friend? 

1017
01:14:57,632 --> 01:15:07,530
♫  Why do stars fall down from the
sky every time you walk by?  ♫

1018
01:15:08,743 --> 01:15:18,143
♫  Just like me, they long to be close to you  ♫

1019
01:15:19,523 --> 01:15:24,573
 ♫ On the day that you were born,
the angels got together ♫ 

1020
01:15:24,573 --> 01:15:28,362
 ♫ And decided to create a dream come true ♫ 

1021
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:31,231
 Jae Pil, now that I think it's over,
I miss her more. 

1022
01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:32,913
 Then, why don't you visit her at the hospital? 

1023
01:15:32,913 --> 01:15:34,373
 Hi. 

1024
01:15:34,373 --> 01:15:35,673
 H-Hi. 

1025
01:15:35,673 --> 01:15:38,233
 The note I gave you last time. 

1026
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:41,103
 You gave it to her, right? 

1027
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,510
 And you? Weren't you interested in him, too? 

1028
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,247
 No! I thought he was interested in me. 

1029
01:15:47,247 --> 01:15:48,643
 I'm not interested in dating. 

1030
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:51,473
 And he doesn't know anything about me. 

1031
01:15:51,473 --> 01:15:53,103
 Ugly, is something wrong? 

1032
01:15:53,103 --> 01:15:55,383
 I don't like myself. 

1033
01:15:55,383 --> 01:15:56,503
 Why don't you? 

1034
01:15:56,503 --> 01:15:59,963
 Happiness is subjective.
You have to pursue it yourself. 

1035
01:15:59,963 --> 01:16:02,013
 Wait! Wait. 

1036
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:03,403
 Eat with me. 

1037
01:16:03,403 --> 01:16:05,333
 So, what about you? 

1038
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:08,323
 He has been on my mind. Oddly. 

1039
01:16:10,473 --> 01:16:15,213
 

1040
01:16:22,903 --> 01:16:25,173
Mr. Son, please stop the car.

1041
01:16:25,173 --> 01:16:27,133
Chairman Han said to bring you right away.

1042
01:16:27,133 --> 01:16:30,023
- He might get mad.
- I'll take responsibility.

1043
01:16:31,283 --> 01:16:33,313
I'll say I ran away, so you don't get in trouble.

1044
01:16:33,313 --> 01:16:35,323
So please, stop the car.
