1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,440
   

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,430
   

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,330
   

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,740
   

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,540
   

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,010
   

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,730
   

8
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,640
All right!

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,540
   

10
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,210
   

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:04,060

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,810
   

13
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,330
You can get off.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
- Please board slowly. 
 - Don't push me!

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,420
Please board carefully.

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,250
All right!

17
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,200
Kyunghee Bank! We're not responsible 
 if you doze off and miss your stop.

18
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,660
Please get ready in advance.

19
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,150
Watch your steps.

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,030
Hello.

21
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,380
Please board slowly. To the front.

22
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,390
Please go to the front.

23
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,570
Let's go in. I'll push.

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,680
That won't work.

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,490
It won't close.

26
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,290
Please move toward the middle and make room.

27
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,730
Sorry, getting on!

28
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,470
That won't work.

29
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,960
Even the Bionic Woman couldn't make it happen.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,210
Please make some room.

31
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,050
Please make room!

32
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,540
Just a little more.

33
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,120
That's dangerous.

34
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,300
They're getting on.

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,360
- Two, three! 
  - Wow! 

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,300
Oh wow!

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,090
All right, Mr. Driver!

38
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,790
Please help me out.

39
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm dead meat if I'm late again.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,270
 - There's no more room! 
 - Let's go. 

41
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,750
- Listen, are you good at holding your breath? 
 - Pardon?

42
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,210
Okay. Take a deep breath.

43
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,120
- One, two... 
  - There's no room! 

44
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,860
 - Come on! 
 - Stop pushing. 

45
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,070
She said she's dead meat if she's late.

46
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,190
We should help each other.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,880
 Let's go already! 

48
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,320
Mr. Driver! I didn't get on. Stop!

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,740
Mr. Driver!

50
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
Stop!

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,320
I didn't get on. Stop!

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,690
Mr. Driver, the attendant hasn't boarded.

53
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,900
Mr. Driver!

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,920
 Stop! Mr. Driver! 

55
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,720
 This is how our story begins. 

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,460
 Our youth was weary and shabby. 

57
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,560
 But it still shone brightly 
 because we had each other. 

58
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,570
 You and I, during those radiant days... 

59
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,210
 and... 

60
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,040
   

61
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,340
 Please get off carefully. 

62
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,820
Goodbye.

63
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,390
All right!

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
Gosh. That was close.

65
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,810
What kind of bus attendant misses the bus?

66
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,630
The driver would've kept driving 
 if it weren't for that young lady there.

67
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,010
   

68
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,870
 Good work. 

69
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,090
Goodbye. Goodbye.

70
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,050
Your ride is on me.

71
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,630
You even lost your scarf because of me.

72
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,890
And call it even?

73
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,040
It was expensive, though.

74
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,180
Pay me back later, and then some.

75
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,780
Don't read on the bus.

76
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,770
It's the worst for motion sickness.

77
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,570
Geez.

78
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,950
She skipped the honorifics.

79
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,840
She's awesome.

80
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,270
Oh, my gosh!

81
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,700
They flew off.

82
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,730
Sunbaenim, where did my eyes go? Oh, my...

83
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,080
- Oh, no... 
 - Where are they? Give them back!

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,000
- Where did my eyes go? 
 - Right here.

85
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,490
- Oh, gosh. 
 - What just happened?

86
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,510
   

87
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,940
   

88
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,500
   

89
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,900
   

90
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,380
Good work.

91
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,480
   

92
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,460
   

93
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,610
   

94
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,710
   

95
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,240
What are you doing?

96
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
Come on.

97
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,690
Ms. Kye, the gas costs don't add up for February. 
 Please take a look.

98
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,910
Gosh, seriously. Fine.

99
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,300
I told you multiple times to check this.

100
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,350
- Yes. 
 - You'd better not mess up.

101
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,130
No, Ma'am.

102
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,390
Mr. No... Please...

103
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,200
Please let me work.

104
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
It was my first time 
 pocketing the money. Really.

105
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,810
Here we go again. As if I haven't 
 heard that line before.

106
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,180
"It was my first time!" As if.

107
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,490
Hey! Would you believe that if you were me?

108
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,920
Do you think I'm stupid?

109
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,180
I'm telling the truth.

110
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,530
It's already been three days 
 since I've been dispatched.

111
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,850
I need to send money home.

112
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,700
Please let me work.

113
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,250
I'll never do it again. Please?

114
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,100
You won't do.

115
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,460
- Move it! 
 - Please, Mr. No!

116
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,950
Hello.

117
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,530
You are?

118
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,260
The newbie starting today?

119
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,950
Yes. Here you go.

120
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,250
My gosh. You have no attendant experience.

121
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,900
- That's a deal breaker. 
 - No.

122
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,340
Experience is something you can build.

123
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,670
She doesn't look very sturdy.

124
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,400
A bus attendant needs good stamina.

125
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,510
- And your voice must be as loud— 
 - Anybody getting off?

126
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,040
If not, then all right!

127
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,260
Exactly.

128
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,090
You're hired.

129
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,540
   

130
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,506
   

131
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,370
   

132
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,810
Jae Pil, stop dodging 
 and throw some punches. Now!

133
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,700
Hey, stop holding back.

134
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,950
You'll get beaten up like that! So frustrating!

135
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,610
The tournament is coming up, Deok Goo. 
 Pull it together!

136
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,780
That's a foul.

137
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,890
Hey, is your ankle okay?

138
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,590
It looked like you twisted it.

139
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,700
It's fine.

140
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,180
It's fine?

141
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,570
It's fine.

142
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,850
Get him some water.

143
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,270
Hey.

144
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,190
Do you think you're a guru? To take an uppercut?

145
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,980
You should've thrown your punch!

146
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,040
You would've won by K.O.

147
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,430
Jerkface Jae Pil.

148
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,060
What's the point? It's not an official match.

149
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,440
That's my point.

150
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,510
Why won't you compete with such skill?

151
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,500
At least give me a reason.

152
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,140
My goal isn't to compete.

153
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,910
Oh, my goodness.

154
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,250
My goodness.

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,720
Oh, my goodness.

156
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,730
Just look at that chiseled jawline, would you?

157
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,810
Gosh, the female lead might 
 just cut her hand on his jawline.

158
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,770
What's your problem? 
 That was an important scene.

159
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,080
Aigoo, practically drooling 
 like a dog. So pathetic.

160
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,560
Honey, are you being jealous right now?

161
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,250
Do you think I pay for electricity 
 so you can watch dramas?

162
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,730
Oh, my.

163
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,880
Honey, your eyeballs just now.

164
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,700
They were just like back then.

165
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,820
When you saved me from that awful client.

166
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,370
Those lovey-dovey eyeballs.

167
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,760
How can you say "eyeballs"? So crude.

168
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,050
Goodness...

169
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,580
Water.

170
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,060
All right.

171
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,480
He used to be so romantic at one point.

172
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,710
Where has that Han Gi Bok gone?

173
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,270
In his place is a man 
 with a head full of gray hair.

174
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,490
How I miss that man.

175
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,110
Ice.

176
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,490
Geez! You could've told me from the start.

177
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,860
I'm home.

178
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,310
- Oppa! 
 - You're home?

179
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,350
Wait a minute. Stop.

180
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,980
Your hair is awfully wet for someone 
 who was studying all this time.

181
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,680
I ran home as a workout.

182
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,490
Why would a twelfth grader run?

183
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,320
You should spare every breath to study more.

184
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,330
You've already wasted an entire year 
 and caused enough damage.

185
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,320
It's not like you're stupid.

186
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,440
Why can't you bring up 
 your grades with an IQ of 140?

187
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,020
What the heck is this?

188
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,190
Are you policing my underwear now?

189
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,570
Go upstairs and wash up.

190
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,400
Should I wash up, too?

191
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,920
After tucking Se Ri into bed early?

192
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,010
Oppa!

193
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,580
You scared me.

194
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,290
Se Ri. My magical princess.

195
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,860
Se Ri isn't the magical princess.

196
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,100
Minky is the magical princess.

197
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,290
Her name was Se Ri in my days.

198
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,720
So.

199
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,630
- You want me to cut out another doll? 
 - Yes.

200
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,830
Mom didn't want to look away 
 in case a kiss scene was coming up.

201
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,640
Do you even know what a kiss is, little girl?

202
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,320
Come here.

203
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,640
I'll do my best not to cut off 
 the tail like last time.

204
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,550
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

205
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,150
   

206
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,810
 It's a cockroach! 

207
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,890
I caught it.

208
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,210
Rest in peace.

209
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,530
I hope you're reborn as a human next time.

210
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,410
That scared the heck out of me.

211
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,940
Gosh.

212
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,860
That girl is something else.

213
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,530
Hey. Drink some water with that. 
 You'll get sick.

214
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,990
That's already your fourth one.

215
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,200
Anyway, our Yeong Rye is so interesting.

216
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,380
You work as a bus attendant, 
 yet you're always carsick.

217
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,720
For someone who's always sick, 
 you've got one hell of an appetite.

218
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,160
You eat like a pig 
 but are still as skinny as a stick.

219
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,240
Skinny as a stick, but you kill 
 cockroaches like it's nothing.

220
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,030
I couldn't eat lunch because I was carsick.

221
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,110
I need to eat while I can.

222
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,340
Unni, try wearing sunglasses.

223
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,420
Hong Ja from next door says 
 they help with the sickness.

224
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,090
She also gets carsick when it rains.

225
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,630
I thought I took my glasses off.

226
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,520
What's wrong with me?

227
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,770
Hey, having fun?

228
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,040
Your sense of humor is one-of-a-kind.

229
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,080
She's not normal, either.

230
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,650
Damn it! You punks!

231
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,770
Shut your pie holes!

232
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,340
I'm feeling very down and easily triggered today.

233
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,150
Unni is edgy since she's on a diet.

234
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,920
Which is why I was trying to sleep.

235
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,350
But one is stuffing her face with sweet-smelling bread while chattering away.

236
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,870
Is it too much to ask for 
 some peas and quiet? Well?

237
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,680
Unni. It's peace, not peas—

238
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,210
Three musketeers.

239
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,550
Front and center.

240
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,870
Front and center!

241
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,570
Let the singing and dancing begin.

242
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,910
Until my mood improves.

243
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,800
Move on to the next song 
 if it's not to my liking.

244
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,670
"Singing as dancing." Start. 
    

245
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,560
Don't you know what "start" means?

246
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,470
Get moving, you punks.

247
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,630
♪ All the loved ones gather together ♪

248

"Eternal Friends."

Come in.

260
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,790
Listen up.

261
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,980
This is our newbie, Seo Jong Hui.

262
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,310
She has no attendant experience.

263
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,610
Everyone, show her the ropes.

264
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,810
Don't pick up any bad habits.

265
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,540
Go to sleep!

266
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,450
What was your name again?

267
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,810
Seo Jong Hui.

268
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,380
Damn. That was quite informal.

269
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm sure you're four 
 or five years younger than me.

270
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,000
How old are you?

271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,240
Twenty freaking three years old. What now?

272
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,430
So am I.

273
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,800
- We're the same age? 
 - Indeed.

274
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,980
What does age matter? Seniority is what counts.

275
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,400
How dare a newbie smack gum 
 at her sunbae's face?

276
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,070
So polite of you.

277
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,940
On your first day, too. What a sight to unfold.

278
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,100
You mean, "behold," not "unfold."

279
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,370
Unfold means to reveal or open something.

280
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,660
Hey! Are you crazy? How dare a newbie—

281
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,900
Seo, what's your face?

282
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,470
- Jong Hui. 
 - Yes.

283
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,300
Jong Hui. Johnny. Whatever.

284
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,800
You must think you're so smart.

285
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:21,370
You've got a lot of nerve, Smartass. You hear me?

286
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,880
Do you have any idea 
 who you're dealing with here?

287
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,450
   

288
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,380
Buy the time...

289
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,700
Buy the time.

290
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,710
Get paid, get paid.

291
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,410
Formal English Grammar.

292
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,800
   

293
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,160
It's a good book.

294
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,870
But you should also sleep when others do.

295
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,170
By the way...

296
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,220
are you really the same age as Unnie Hae Ja?

297
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,860
What's she saying? Of course, that's a lie.

298
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,630
Are you the year of the tiger?

299
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,420
Or rabbit?

300
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,890
Year of...

301
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,380
the rabbit.

302
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,550
Relax.

303
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,380
You're actually my age.

304
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,150
I put on an amazing performance earlier.

305
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,660
   

306
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,700
Is it morning already?

307
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,580
I-It's time to get up.

308
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,490
Wake up.

309
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,630
   

310
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,510
 National exercise, start. 

311
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,490
 One, two, three, four, 

312
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,660
 five, six, seven, eight. 

313
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,630
 Two, two, three, four, 

314
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,580
 five, six, seven, legs. 

315
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,660
 One, two, three, four, 

316
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,520
 five, six, seven, eight. 

317
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 Two, two, three, four, 

318
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,340
 five, six, seven, torso. 

319
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,280
 One, two, three, four... 

320
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,390
That bitch is something else. Don't you think?

321
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,080
Yes. I get the feeling she's raised some hell.

322
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
She's not your average bitch.

323
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,390
I think that bitch lied about her age too.

324
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,470
I ought to nip her in the bud.

325
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,010
 Four, five, six, seven, breathe. 

326
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,870
Hello, Sir.

327
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,100
Jae Pil, why don't you ride with us?

328
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,220
It's okay. You didn't see me.

329
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,020
I'm taking off.

330
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,240
   

331
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,530
 Bus No. 3. 

332
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,120
 What's taking the attendant for Bus No.3 so long? 

333
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,690
 It's already two minutes behind schedule! 

334
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,500
Hey, Ko Yeong Rye. Hey, come here.

335
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,400
- Take a trainee around today. 
 - Pardon?

336
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,500
Hae Ja would be better than me...

337
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,300
Whatever. She's the most honest 
 and competent worker we have.

338
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,600
I'll leave it to you. I'm leaving.

339
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,920
♪ La-dee-da ♪

340
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,530
I'm in your hands.

341
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,740
Miss Honest-and-competent.

342
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,470
Competent? Me? Hardly.

343
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,020
What could I possibly teach you?

344
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
   

345
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,450
Please take your time getting off.

346
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,230
No matter how many passengers there are,

347
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,600
you must receive each fare individually.

348
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,650
It's confusing if they all get off at once.

349
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,030
Giving correct change is tricky 
 when they pay cash.

350
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,810
You have to be quick and accurate.

351
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,870
With practice, you'll be able to tell 10 won 
 from 100 won even in your pocket.

352
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,560
Impressive drawing skills.

353
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,550
Save your talent and show me your ticket.

354
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,140
Damn it.

355
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,000
Whoa. That looked so real.

356
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,160
How could you tell right away?

357
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,760
The paper texture is different.

358
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,450
The crucial thing is their eyes.

359
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,180
People with fake tickets have trembling eyes.

360
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,230
All aboard!

361
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,850
Let's go.

362
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,150
All right, Mr. Driver!

363
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,650
Please slowly get off one by one.

364
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,020
- He's paying for me. 
 - Behind me.

365
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,570
Behind me.

366
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,850
W-Wait!

367
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,350
That's only one. What about your friends' fare?

368
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,080
Friends?

369
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,600
You're mistaken. I rode alone.

370
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,270
Hey! Ko Yeong Rye, where are you going?

371
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,600
Gosh, there she goes again.

372
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,670
Gosh, seriously.

373
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,140
Three tokens.

374
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,680
Hand them over. Now.

375
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,900
Why do you think we ran?

376
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,380
My mom used to tell me.

377
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,860
Even a beggar has his pride.

378
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,490
It's okay to live without, 
 but don't live without shame.

379
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,890
Hold on! Hold on.

380
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,230
Should we turn in the other direction?

381
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,380
I have severe motion sickness.

382
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,690
What the hell are you saying?

383
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,520
No! You can't leave. Give me the tokens!

384
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,470
Hand over the tokens!

385
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,010
Three tokens. Right now.

386
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,340
I told you to move.

387
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,500
Move it!

388
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,560
This is your final warning.

389
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,090
Move.

390
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:24,260
One, two, three!

391
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,100
Why don't you pay up?

392
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,400
- Your meds will cost more. 
 - What did you say?

393
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,060
Wait! W-Wait!

394
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,440
Damn it. Where's my wallet?

395
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,220
Are you all right?

396
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,550
Yes.

397
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:51,500
♫  Why do birds suddenly 
 appear every time you are near?  ♫

398
00:31:51,500 --> 00:32:01,100
♫  Just like me, they long to be close to you  ♫

399
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:13,300
♫  Why do stars fall down from the sky 
 every time you walk by?  ♫

400
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:24,290
♫  Just like me, they long to be close to you  ♫

401
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:29,360
♫  On the day that you were born, 
 the angels got together  ♫

402
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,450
♫  And decided to create a dream come true  ♫

403
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,650
♫  So they sprinkled moondust in your hair  ♫

404
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,940

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,910
   

406
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,140
You! On all fours! 
    

407
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,550
Hey! You want a piece of me?

408
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,560
Get down!

409
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,050
I told you to be on time!

410
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,840
 Hey. 

411
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,810
 Be on time! 

412
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,240
Who are you? Late again? I'll show you!

413
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,640
Geez, I almost jumped out of my skin.

414
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,240
I thought you were the dean.

415
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,380
What's the occasion?

416
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,260
The school committee 
 chairman's son scaling walls?

417
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,360
Hey!

418
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,750
I heard your nickname is 
 Prince Shitface Charming.

419
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,600
- Good for you. 
 - Hey.

420
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,270
What do you mean, "Prince Shitface"?

421
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,840
I heard he had to repeat a year 
 because he was sick.

422
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,280
You should call him, Prince Hyungnim.

423
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,680
Hyungnim.

424
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,180
How about it? You want a puff before you go?

425
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,460
You can puff all you want.

426
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,310
Quiet!

427
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,280
Sit down.

428
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,120
I don't have any special announcements.

429
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,770
You. Whose seat is that?

430
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,400
Han Jae Pil. He went to take a dump.

431
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,370
Oh, Jae Pil?

432
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,480
Air out the room during break.

433
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,450
The female teachers cry about the smell,

434
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,760
saying it's so hard to teach.

435
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,180
 Okay. 

436
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,740
That's all.

437
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,800
So did you oversleep? Jerkface, Jae Pil.

438
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,230
Get off me. It's too early for this.

439
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,070
No. I'll glue myself to you.

440
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,520
I must really be emotionally needy.

441
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,200
My parents couldn't hold me much 
 since they were busy working.

442
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,140
Oh! Stir-fried octopus.

443
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,300
Your stepmom still hasn't figured 
 out you can't eat spicy food?

444
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,240
Can't? I can eat it quite well now.

445
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,670
Says the guy who rinses kimchi.

446
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,600
That was back in middle school.

447
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,240
Give me that.

448
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,000
You're so cute! So cute! 
 Trying to keep your pride, huh?

449
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,190
Hey. You'll go watch the 
 tournament tomorrow, right?

450
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,580
Of course.

451
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,270
Let's cut the 7th period since it's P.E.

452
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,470
   

453
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,610
Yeong Rye, why are you ironing a hand towel?

454
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,060
That's some devotion.

455
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,400
I'm just bored.

456
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,340
Leave that alone and 
 help me out with mending this.

457
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,190
It's not going so smoothly.

458
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,820
Unnie, you're a certified sewing technician.

459
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,040
Oh, my.

460
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,460
Geez. Being too hardworking is a sickness, too.

461
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,920
Why did you get certified if 
 you weren't going to join a garment factory?

462
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
You never know.

463
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,310
You're a total pro.

464
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,230
Hey, youngest of the musketeers,

465
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,550
come and give me a rub.

466
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,830
Just do it.

467
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,850
Ouch. Do it right, will you?

468
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,160
Level two.

469
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,800
Level three.

470
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,070
It's so cold.

471
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,560
Girls, are you hungry?

472
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,900
I'll treat you to a snack.

473
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,300
Hey, Newbie.

474
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,970
Newbie.

475
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,880
- Me? 
 - Yes, you.

476
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,980
Newbies are responsible for making deliveries.

477
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,060
Listen carefully. I'll only say this once.

478
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,380
Go to Ddo Ddo Bunsik 
 and get 10 jumbo dumplings,

479
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,940
two bags of tteokbokki without green onions,

480
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,340
three servings of soondae with 
 the liver and heart, but without lungs,

481
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,100
and five straight odengs, not the wavy ones, 
 with plenty of broth.

482
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,576
Stop by Hwajeong Super next door and 
 get five crackers, four naegeori candies,

483
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,120
four almond chocolates, and two liters of milk.

484
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,970
You got all that, right?

485
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,020
Then get going.

486
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,080
Say that again. Buy what?

487
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,980
I told you I'll only say it once.

488
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,810
Eating too late will be tough to digest 
 so come back by 10 p.m.

489
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,740
I'll lock the door 
 if you don't come back in time.

490
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,490
You're still here?

491
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,790
You only have 29 minutes left.

492
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,300
Ten jumbo dumplings, two bags 
 of tteokbokki without green onions,

493
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,970
and soondae... soondae...

494
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,420
Without the body? G-Give me a moment.

495
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,780
Three servings with the liver and heart, 
 but without lungs.

496
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,470
And five straight odengs, not the wavy ones, 
 with plenty of broth.

497
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,310
Please ring that up first. Hurry.

498
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,130
H-Hold on. Let me ring them up first.

499
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:37,040
Twenty jumbo dumplings are 350 won.

500
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,830
Three plates of tteokbokki are 270 won.

501
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,560
Soondae is 150 won.

502
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,160
Odeng is 240 won.

503
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,910
Tempura is 220 won.

504
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,540
And three rolls of kimbap...

505
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,670
O-Oh, my. I need to start over.

506
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,390
N-No, wait. Allow me.

507
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,600
350 won, 270 won, 150 won,

508
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,450
240 won, 220 won, and 300 won.

509
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,640
That's a total of 1,530 won.

510
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,100
You're fast.

511
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,280
You sure ate a lot.

512
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,480
You're quite the jack of all trades.

513
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,200
When did you learn the abacus?

514
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,480
I got certified just in case.

515
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,380
By the way, you should tread softly.

516
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,120
Your dorm life will be hell 
 if you get on Unnie Hae Ja's bad side.

517
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,110
Her word is law in our room.

518
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,540
Why?

519
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,300
Well, she's the eldest and has seniority.

520
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,890
- And her temper is— 
 - Shitty, right?

521
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,610
That's what I thought.

522
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,780
I don't like her, either.

523
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,460
- Oh, hey, y-you. 
 - Yes?

524
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,950
Can you carry all this back?

525
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,740
Are you going somewhere?

526
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,580
Yes. I'm going to quickly see 
 my mom while I'm out.

527
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,860
You have to hurry back. You know, right?

528
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,760
Hurry back. Hurry!

529
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,670
Hurry back.

530
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,390
Mom!

531
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,520
Mom.

532
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,790
Hey, why would you run?

533
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,250
When you always feel nauseous after running.

534
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,700
What did you come here for?

535
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,810
I stepped out for a bit and thought 
 you might still be here.

536
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,740
Are you wrapping up?

537
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,910
That's the plan.

538
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,770
For crying out loud.

539
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,900
I even had horse customers today.

540
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,880
But they kept complaining out of their butts,

541
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,720
saying the horse was worn down 
 and that the spring was dead.

542
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,790
Fortunately, I had some evening customers 
 who bought some bbopki.

543
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:04,100
You know. They say the customer 
 leaving always looks prettiest.

544
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,440
Get down, you two.

545
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,100
 - Okay.  
 - Come here.

546
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,620
Oh, my. Aigoo...

547
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,340
There.

548
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,590
Good job, you little troublemakers.

549
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,970
Here.

550
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,840
One for you, too.

551
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,940
Get sugar high and go, or don't.

552
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,530
How sweet.

553
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,600
You've got sleep in your eye, Yeong Mi.

554
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,290
Well, you didn't leave anything out.

555
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,700
Didn't I tell her to buy egg biscuits?

556
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,030
You didn't.

557
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,070
I'm certain of it.

558
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,130
Come and set it up, you punks!

559
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,930
- Do I have to set the table, too? 
 - Coming.

560
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
What?

561
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,470
Hey, Newbie. You're eating, too? 
 You still have a job to do.

562
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,500
What more do I have to do?

563
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,300
We wash the comforters every 10 days.

564
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,480
This is also the newbie's job.

565
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,690
Right?

566
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,210
Without a doubt, Unnie.

567
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,370
Who else if not the newbie?

568
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,060
How immature.

569
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,920
Being petty over food.

570
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,490
Hey!

571
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,020
What did you just say?

572
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,070
Nothing.

573
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,910
Enjoy your snack.

574
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,220
What's the holdup? Set it up.

575
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,920
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Thank you for the food!

576
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,310
Is Oppa always late these days?

577
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,360
Well, with good reason.

578
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,600
They say poverty is a curse.

579
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,330
He barely has time to study,

580
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,010
but he's also working.

581
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,420
I feel heartbroken and pity 
 when I think about your brother.

582
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,950
I'm worried to death.

583
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,120
Mom, you only pity Oppa.

584
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,130
What about his tuition?

585
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,640
I'll pay it. There's still some time.

586
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,690
Mom, why don't you think about

587
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,770
reaching out to Uncle—

588
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,240
You guys don't have an uncle!

589
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,080
I don't even pee in his direction.

590
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,220
Don't even think about him, 
 no matter how desperate you are.

591
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,670
He sold the family's burial ground 
 when your dad died

592
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,820
and ignored us. What do you expect from him?

593
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,460
You'd be better off 
  waiting for a boiled egg to hatch.

594
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:11,300
Y-Yeong Mi. You haven't been pushing, have you?

595
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,100
I know you're only touching the cart.

596
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,190
Start pushing. Harder.

597
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,900
That'll make it easier on Mom. Come on.

598
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,800
- One, two! One, two! 
  - One, two! One, two! 

599
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,760
One, two!

600
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,110
We're almost home. One, two! One, two!

601
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,600
Get out.

602
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,270
Get the hell out!

603
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,700
Come out! Come out!

604
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,570
Hey. Are you nuts?

605
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,390
- You've gone nuts, right? 
 - Let go of me!

606
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,440
I'm already shitting myself.

607
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,980
Sorry. I'm really shitting myself.

608
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,590
Get out!

609
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,370
Wow. What's going on here?

610
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,230
Oh, geez. I'm dying.

611
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,540
I don't know, either.

612
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,930
My stomach started rumbling 
 in the middle of the night.

613
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,290
And then they all started—

614
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,300
What the—

615
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,770
The other rooms are fine.

616
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,790
What on earth did you eat 
 that everyone's got explosive diarrhea?

617
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,330
You two are okay?

618
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,670
Yes, I am.

619
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,440
Yes, me, too.

620
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,800
This is bad. The buses need to leave.

621
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,030
How will we replace this many people?

622
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,250
As you all know,

623
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,370
this is an emergency situation.

624
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,200
It's an emergency situation, so there's 
 no time to think about who's doing what.

625
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,150
Everyone needs to hurry.

626
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,650
We took this since you gave it to us.

627
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,580
But what do you expect us to do?

628
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,770
Someone needs to collect the fare, so for now—

629
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,670
For now, just get on the bus.

630
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,570
Just open and close the doors,

631
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,900
collect the fare, and go on.

632
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,790
No big deal. Give it.

633
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,230
There's no time for this. Hurry and get ready.

634
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,930
Come on. Get on.

635
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,500
Hurry. Go, go.

636
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,490
Ko Yeong Rye! Come out here.

637
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,750
Trainee!

638
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,480
You get on your own bus today!

639
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,900
Hurry!

640
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,350
Hey, Punk.

641
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:46,510
If you were injured, 
 you should've told me!

642
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,200
What will we do? Oh, gosh.

643
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,630
You have a tournament around the corner.

644
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,160
Damn it! I'm going crazy...

645
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,410
We're hopeless if we can't even 
 make the welterweight.

646
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,880
I can compete.

647
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,400
I just need to ice it.

648
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,860
Hey. You think icing it will be enough?

649
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,830
Don't make me the bad guy.

650
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,610
This could end your professional career, man!

651
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,460
What should I do with this guy?

652
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,500
I'm losing it. Damn it!

653
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,700
- Coach! 
 - What?

654
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,340
Coach.

655
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,050
We're here.

656
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,630
We ran at the speed of light.

657
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:34,360
Jae Pil, could you help me out this once?

658
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,380
Me?

659
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,620
I didn't. Why would I do that?

660
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,080
As if you didn't!

661
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,470
Then why does everyone have explosive diarrhea?

662
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,170
You and Yeong Rye are the only 
 two who didn't eat and are fine.

663
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,230
You spiked the food with something.

664
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,000
Well, was it a laxative or something?

665
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,330
Hey. I'm not that petty.

666
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,350
Unlike you.

667
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,970
What? You little...

668
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,720
Hey. How old are you? Well?

669
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,440
- Reveal your true age, Bitch! 
 - Hold on.

670
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,630
Is age a big deal? Well?

671
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:13,380
- Whoa, incredible. Incredible! 
 - Let go! I said, let go!

672
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,900
What if they go bald at this rate?

673
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,650
Damn, that vile girl.

674
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,760
They say to let sleeping dogs lie.

675
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,650
But she grabbed Kwon Hae Ja's hair.

676
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,560
Hey, who do you think will let go first?

677
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,340
I bet it's Kwon Hae Ja.

678
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,980
 - Hit her with this! 
 - You bitch! 

679
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,700
 Isn't this enough? 

680
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,100
I bet it's the newbie.

681
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,070
What about you, Yeong Rye? Who do you bet on?

682
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,040
Hey, I have to go.

683
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,020
Me, too.

684
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,390
 Watch the face! Not the face! 

685
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,930
 Hey! 

686
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:49,240
All right! Let go on three, okay?

687
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,380
One, two, three!

688
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,400
That's right. Still holding on. Marvelous!

689
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,360
- Let go! One, two, three! 
 - Let go. One, two, three!

690
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,600
Seriously. You, pains in the butt.

691
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,100
Kwon Hae Ja! Are you positive?

692
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,720
I'm positive!

693
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,290
She's the culprit.

694
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,470
If not, I'll change my last name.

695
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,640
From Kwon Hae Ja to Lie Hae Ja.

696
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,240
No. I'll quit this job.

697
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,790
Get out of there!

698
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,810
Get out!

699
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,490
That's right!

700
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,250
Throw a punch! Punch his face!

701
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,170
- Relax. 
 - Punch him!

702
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,680
No!

703
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,320
Hey, Jae Pil. Are you okay?

704
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,700
 No! Stop it! Leave me alone! 

705
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,820
I said, no!

706
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,780
Stop it!

707
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,990
My mom said no!

708
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,850
No! No!

709
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,700
No!

710
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,480
 One! 

711
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,380
 Two! 

712
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,120
 Three! 

713
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,090
Four! Five!

714
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,050
You okay?

715
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,490
- Nice! You can do it! 
 - Good job.

716
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,220
Let's do it!

717
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:00,060
One! Two! Three! Four!

718
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,500
Five! Six! Seven!

719
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,060
- Eight! Nine! 
  - Eight! Nine! 

720
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,620
Ten!

721
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,630
This is Aurora TV from Shinhong 
 Electronics, which we're promoting.

722
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,590
It's a whopping 20 inches.

723
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,860
A product equipped with a color-adjustment 
 feature, keeping up with the times.

724
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,590
- That's nice. 
 - Yes.

725
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,500
It looks great.

726
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,800
- Switch to another channel. 
 - Yes, Sir.

727
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,990
 There was an unexpected event 
 at today's youth boxing tournament. 

728
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,700
- That boy looks a lot like my son. 
  - An unknown newcomer took the victory today. 

729
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,930
- He doesn't just look like him. It's Jae Pil. 
 - Really?

730
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:04,800
 The gym erupted with a mix 
 of cheers and gasps of disbelief. 

731
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,950
 With today's victory, the newcomer 
 has stepped into the limelight as a star. 

732
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,660
That damn boy.

733
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,960
 Professionals are shocked by his potential... 

734
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:23,790
Yeong Rye, washing up?

735
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,170
   

736
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,600
This way.

737
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,820
What? What is it?

738
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,890
Listen.

739
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,050
A little earlier...

740
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,610
Is your mouth glued?

741
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,010
What were you doing brawling in that place?

742
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,940
It's not brawling. It's boxing.

743
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,380
What?

744
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,390
How dare you, Punk.

745
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,420
Running around doing stupid stuff,

746
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,040
no wonder your grades are crap 
 despite that good brain of yours!

747
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,180
Aren't you going to college?

748
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,130
Was repeating a year not enough? 
 Will you repeat another year?

749
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:36,030
Is that why I'm wasting a fortune 
 as the school committee chairman?

750
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,030
Stop fooling around and get tutored.

751
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,910
I'll hire the best tutor.

752
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,530
No. That's illegal.

753
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,880
You punk.

754
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,250
Since when did you live a law-abiding life?

755
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,250
Get down!

756
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,720
You have to go to college.

757
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,800
I don't want to.

758
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,240
That's not my dream.

759
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,690
It's your regret and your unfulfilled dream.

760
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,180
What?

761
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,670
You rude little bastard!

762
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:08,910
What will you do if you glare at me?

763
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,500
Get down.

764
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,120
Get down, you punk!

765
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,560
You punk, you take my words for shit?

766
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,920
What? College is my regret?

767
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,800
If you're aware of that, 
 then you should try even harder!

768
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,610
You still won't get tutored?

769
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:43,350
Still?

770
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,550
Still?

771
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,440
It hurts.

772
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,890
   

773
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,129
   

774
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,680
   

775
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,000
What are you two doing here?

776
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,290
Hey!

777
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,800
Why are you ransacking my bag 
 in the middle of the night?

778
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,910
Shit. What the heck?

779
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,200
Why are you making so much noise 
 in the middle of the night?

780
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,300
They're ransacking my bag like little thieves.

781
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,430
What the hell?

782
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,840
You're even stealing now?

783
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,270
Look.

784
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:15,515
   

785
00:59:15,515 --> 00:59:16,560
What is it?

786
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,520
We found it in Sook Ja's bag.

787
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,920
I believe it's a laxative.

788
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,820
Earlier, I also saw her eating 
 cream bread in the bathroom.

789
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,910
How could someone with 
 a stomachache eat cream bread?

790
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,290
I never ate cream bread.

791
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:34,460
Hae Ja, it's not true.

792
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,640
She's just jumping to conclusions.

793
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,970
Then what is this?

794
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,130
This... this...

795
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,860
is cold medicine.

796
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,980
Since yesterday,

797
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,900
I've been having cold symptoms.

798
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,090
Then I'll eat this.

799
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,380
We'll find out whether it's 
 cold medicine or a laxative after I eat it.

800
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,640
Since I never had a stomachache.

801
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,600
Come on. No signal yet?

802
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,360
Maybe it was actually cold medicine.

803
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,910
   

804
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,970
What a relief.

805
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,930
I had to go.

806
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,920
Fine.

807
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,540
I did it!

808
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,730
I'm always on standby 
 so I can't earn any money.

809
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,470
I couldn't stand all of you in high spirits.

810
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:27,960
I wanted you in my shoes, 
 being unable to work and earn money

811
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,490
so I spiked the odeng broth 
 with laxatives. So what!

812
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,720
Hey. You call that an excuse?

813
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,700
You're out of your damn mind!

814
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,450
That's right! I'm out of my mind!

815
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:40,100
You think I would've done that if I were?

816
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:45,230
To be blunt, who here hasn't 
 pocketed money at least once?

817
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:48,400
Why am I the only one being punished?

818
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,320
Why only me?

819
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:16,940
You were so certain.

820
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,380
But it turns out I'm not the one.

821
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,900
- So? 
 - You swore in front of Mr. No and Ms. Kye.

822
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,110
That if I'm innocent,

823
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,900
you'll...

824
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,520
quit this job for good.

825
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,550
So you really expect me 
 to resign over this crap?

826
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,420
How dare you threaten me?

827
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,680
Hey!

828
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,670
One thing I hate the most is violence.

829
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,300
Let's just sweep this incident under the rug.

830
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:58,600
I'll put up with the suspicious looks 
 that I might be the culprit.

831
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,580
In return...

832
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,480
stop telling the girls to massage you.

833
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,320
They're also exhausted at the end of the day.

834
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,720
- Are you all right? 
 - No.

835
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,780
I'm not. This is already my fifth trip.

836
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,520
Hey, you want to go to the hospital? Or—

837
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,710
That's not it.

838
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:45,030
I'm really hungry.

839
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,740
After emptying everything out.

840
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,330
Will you really be all right?

841
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:11,110
Ramen has to be hard on the bowels.

842
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:14,320
I don't know. I just want to eat while I can.

843
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,370
Even if it comes right back out.

844
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:19,020
You're truly an eun-ddo, right?

845
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,290
Eun-ddo? What's that?

846
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,000
A low-key psycho who is scarier 
 than an outright nutcase.

847
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,800
If you didn't know, now you know. 
 You're definitely an eun-ddo.

848
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:34,440
- This is delicious. 
 - Is it?

849
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,690
Look. I'll show you something cool.

850
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,730
I can spin this with my neck. Okay.

851
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:45,270
Look.

852
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:47,690
Whoa!

853
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:50,220
Cool, right?

854
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,350
Want a piece?

855
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:55,870
Yes.

856
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,110
You're not a certified Hula Hoop 
 Instructor, too. Are you?

857
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,370
You seem really hardworking.

858
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:12,710
You have many certifications 
 and even study when you can.

859
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,000
My certifications are more of a backup.

860
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,140
And my real goal is to attend college.

861
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,540
By taking the GED.

862
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,960
College?

863
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,100
Whoa. That's admirable.

864
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:35,100
I want to study Korean Literature 
 and become a teacher or professor.

865
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,930
That'll take some time, though.

866
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:44,270
Once my family's circumstances 
 improve, I'll give it all I've got.

867
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,340
What about you?

868
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,590
Do you have a dream?

869
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:52,000
I do.

870
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,650
I

871
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,400
might try to become Miss Korea.

872
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:01,890
Then I'll get into acting.

873
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:06,680
I'll make people cry and laugh, 
 and touch their hearts.

874
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,420
And become a star brighter 
 than that one right up there.

875
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:17,240
That's really impressive.

876
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,560
I think you'll definitely make it.

877
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,310
I'm not so sure.

878
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:26,260
It looks like I'll be yelling 
 "All right!" day and night.

879
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,390
In the textbook I'm studying these days,

880
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:33,700
there's an example sentence like this.

881
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,780
"Boys, be ambitious."

882
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,840
What does that mean?

883
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,900
"Boys, be ambitious."

884
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,550
"Be ambitious, not for money,"

885
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:49,490
"not for selfish aggrandizement,"

886
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:53,640
"not for the evanescent thing 
 which men call fame."

887
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:59,360
"Be ambitious for the attainment 
 of all that a man can be."

888
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,580
So every morning, I recite a spell.

889
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,560
Girls, be ambitious.

890
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,090
Who says only boys can be ambitious?

891
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,830
Girls should, too.

892
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,190
Life is long.

893
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:23,200
I think I just fell for you.

894
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:31,170
I already fell for you.

895
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:35,480
Back when you blew that huge bubble on the bus.

896
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,520
- Really? 
 - Yes.

897
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,430
I'm glad it's mutual.

898
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:45,130
I don't like one-sided love.

899
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,230
You know that we get a day off 
 after two days of work, right?

900
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,620
What will you do, then?

901
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,820
I'm not sure.

902
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:06,790
Sleeping the day away would be a waste.

903
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:10,010
- Maybe go to the city? 
 - Yes!

904
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,060
- What? 
 - Yes.

905
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,180
L-Let's go to the city together.

906
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,300
- Together? 
 - Yes.

907
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,900
- It'll be so much fun. 
 - Sure!

908
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,000
Show me that, again.

909
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,440
- That was so cool, right? 
 - Yes.

910
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,110
Okay, look. Look.

911
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:30,220
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

912
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,590
I want to try it, too!

913
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,390
- You do? 
 - Yes.

914
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,780
Be careful. Come this way.

915
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,590
So, just bend down and...

916
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:46,270
   

917
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,430
Look.

918
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,550
Say "ah."

919
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:12,040
You eat that one.

920
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,810
This is the place 
 I was saying I stumbled across.

921
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:21,610
They play your song requests 
 and even play live music.

922
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,370
Welcome to Vivaldi.

923
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,680
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

924
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,660
You can sit anywhere.

925
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,090
Here?

926
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,170
   

927
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:47,140
What the heck. Give me a high five.

928
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,160
- Up high. 
 - Yes!

929
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,460
- Have a safe trip. 
 - See you later.

930
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,260
- Did you turn it in? 
 - Yes.

931
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,880
It's "Close To You."

932
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,820
Where should we go today?

933
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:21,810
Vivaldi.

934
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,020
Vivaldi, go!

935
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,760
Again.

936
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:39,720
Again.

937
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,860
Your father is really something.

938
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,810
It's not like you committed a crime.

939
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:55,120
It was just a little boxing, 
 and he even got you a driver 24/7.

940
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,740
Are you being abducted, again? Straight home?

941
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,940
Probably.

942
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,030
Geez.

943
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:04,710
Boxing isn't the same without you at the gym.

944
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,480
That's called separation anxiety, man.

945
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,140
Now is the time to gain some 
 independence away from yours truly.

946
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,730
No, thank you. I don't want to.

947
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,790
We have to visit Ddo Ddo Bunsik again.

948
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:21,770
One of their regulars is this girl 
 I've got my eye on.

949
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:23,280
Hey.

950
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:26,480
You want to try plotting a scheme?

951
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,180
A scheme?

952
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,910
What?

953
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,320
All right. Take one.

954
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,530
Here you go.

955
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:48,100
Good work.

956
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,690
Take this. Here you go.

957
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:52,320
Stop, Ji Hoon.

958
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,680
That was some great acting earlier. Good job.

959
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,790
You were so natural. You can take two.

960
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:59,310
Bravo.

961
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:09,180
I gave away two weeks' worth of 
 bus tickets to eat tteokbokki with you.

962
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,390
You're the one who planned, 
 directed, and acted it.

963
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:12,890
I told you I wasn't interested.

964
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,540
Come on!

965
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,640
The girl at Ddo Ddo Bunsik is a real looker.

966
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,010
To show you that girl, I—

967
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:22,220
- He's so handsome. 
 - Oh, my gosh.

968
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,190
You saw that, right? They were staring at you.

969
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:28,700
I saw.

970
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,360
What should I do with this narcissistic prince?

971
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,670
He's well-off, smart, and even popular.

972
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:37,270
You'd better not study.

973
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,510
If you get good grades 
 on top of all that, you'll be insufferable.

974
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,470
I won't hang out with you.

975
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,730
Watch your steps.

976
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,630
How long has it been since a day off?

977
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:53,600
I know.

978
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:59,250
What nice weather, huh?

979
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,170
Very nice!

980
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,660
   

981
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:10,980
Come on. Hurry.

982
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,620
We'll be late for the movie.

983
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:15,020
Yes. Coming.

984
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,020
What's the title of the movie?

985
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,250
You'll see.

986
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,700
It's a movie that nourishes our very lives.

987
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,470
By the way, shouldn't you visit home?

988
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:27,040
You haven't gone in a while.

989
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,000
No, I don't have to go.

990
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
- Shit! 
 - Stop right there!

991
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,990
- Stop, you punk! 
 - Would you stop if you were me?

992
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,440
Bastard!

993
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:56,340
Come here.

994
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:01,420
I don't know her. I've never seen her before.

995
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,260
Then why did you run?

996
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,580
You bolted because you felt guilty, Punk.

997
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:10,510
I just figured I'd duck out first and see.

998
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,460
Take another look. Okay?

999
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,300
Her name is Seo Jong Yeon.

1000
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:21,740
Someone saw her in your turf, you bastard. 
 You really don't know?

1001
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:26,660
Look, I have a talent for remembering 
 girls' faces after one look.

1002
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:29,420
But I've never seen this face before. Really.

1003
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,150
Shit.

1004
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,350
Hey, what will you do about this?

1005
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,370
I only have a few left.

1006
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,700
Hey, Han Jae Pil!

1007
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,070
It's double the pleasure seeing 
 you outside of school.

1008
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:00,840
Is it? Not for me.

1009
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,710
How scary.

1010
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,210
Why don't you come to the 
 boxing gym these days?

1011
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:20,330
Is it no fun for you after 
 competing in my place once?

1012
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:22,520
Is boxing too boring for you?

1013
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:28,620
From the looks of it, I might be able 
 to compete again, thanks to you.

1014
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,060
What did you just say?

1015
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,540
I would've competed if it weren't for you.

1016
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:35,440
No, I wouldn't have twisted 
 my ankle in the first place.

1017
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,360
It's all because of you. Isn't that right?

1018
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,640
Hey, Deok Goo. What's your problem?

1019
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,400
You stay out of this, you freaking lackey!

1020
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:47,830
Don't.

1021
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,640
Jae Pil!

1022
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,660
- What's going on? Come here! 
 - Shit.

1023
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:25,120
Run!

1024
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,920
Hey, come here!

1025
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,740
- Hey, stop! 
 - Stop right there!

1026
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:33,070
- Hey, stop! 
 - You!

1027
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:37,200
   

1028
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:44,530
This will nourish our lives?

1029
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:48,940
Sure. It'll teach us great things. 
    

1030
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:53,180
We're not underage. 
 There's no reason we can't watch this.

1031
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:56,430
Be confident. Chin up!

1032
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,530
Let's go.

1033
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,250
- Stop right there! 
 - Stop!

1034
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,490
Stop!

1035
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:08,040
- Hey! 
 - Stop!

1036
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,680
Hey, stop!

1037
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,800
- Hey. 
 - Hey!

1038
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,180
- Jong Hui. 
 - Yes?

1039
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,640
I'm just going to the bathroom.

1040
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,690
Sure, go ahead.

1041
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:19,670
I'll be inside. 
    

1042
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:30,460
 Back then, there was a thirst 
 I couldn't satiate without running. 

1043
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,180
 Not even knowing what I wanted, 

1044
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,460
 yet unable to stop. 

1045
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:39,220
 As if my brakes were broken. 

1046
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,400
 It was there, at the very end, that I met you. 

1047
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:12,210
 This is how our story begins. 

1048
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,620
   

1049
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:32,030


1050
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,090
 - Stop! 
 - So did you meet Giant or not? 

1051
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,520
 I'm going to forget about Giant now. 

1052
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,750
 And I'm going to apply for that. 

1053
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:48,770
 A high school diploma is 
 required to become Miss Korea. 

1054
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,700
 Whoa, going to school. 

1055
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,750
 Geez, going to school. 

1056
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,590
 Hey, this hyung is planning 
 something extraordinary. 

1057
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,680
 Let's go on a group blind date. 4 vs. 4. 

1058
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,760
 Who has time for a blind date? Forget it, man. 

1059
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,610
 This is so pretty— 

1060
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:05,400
 Don't touch that! 

1061
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,950
 I started writing my diary. 

1062
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,870
 "I hung out with Yeong Rye." 

1063
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:12,020
 "It was fun. I was happy." 

1064
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,910
 Those words usually had nothing to do with me. 

1065
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:17,390
 But life is fun now, thanks to you. 

1066
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:21,550
 Mr. No, could you please let me just this once? 

1067
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:30,310
