1
00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:02,970


2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,900
 It's Giant. 

3
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,140
Hey.

4
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,840
What's your problem? Are you a pervert?

5
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,750
I ought to...

6
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,600
Thank you for your hard work.

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,410
You eat your mom's warm meals to go around fighting all the time? Huh?

8
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,250
- That's not what-
- Be quiet!

9
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,480
Is the police station your school? Huh?

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,660
Should I go get your attendance
log or something? Huh?

11
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,760
You little punks.

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,870
But what's with this kid?

13
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,590
What's your story? Are you a new face?

14
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,100
- I ought to-
- Stop. Stop!

15
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,500
How dare you lay a hand on him?

16
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,080
The police are the pillar of the people.

17
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,090
Not a baton!

18
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,570
What do you think you're doing?

19
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,120
Why are you smacking my son's head?

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,610
How can you treat the victim like this?

21
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,400
He's not the victim.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,870
For your information, they're
involved in a mutual assault.

23
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,210
Even so! I'm pretty sure someone
else threw the first punch.

24
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,210
My son isn't capable of that.

25
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,680
So, it's probably one of them.

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,540
You think I pay taxes so you can
work thoughtlessly like this?

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,250
Okay. Father, we got it. Please calm down.

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,350
I never had a son like you!

29
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,560
Tell the chief to get out here.
Do you know who I am?

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,970
I'm Han Gi Bok! You got that?

31
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,270
I exchanged business cards with
your chief at a breakfast meeting.

32
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,950
We even went to the sauna together. Got it?

33
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,370
That's who I am. Got that?

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,660
Forget it.

35
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,360
Where's the chief's office? Here?

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,290
- Chief Jang! Chief Jang Joong Pil!
- Please hold on.

37
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,100
Wow.

38
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,080
Hey, Ko Yeong Rye.

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Hey!

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,730
- Huh?
- Get it together.

41
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,790
Wipe off that drool.

42
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,740
 

43
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,400
That was fun.

44
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,750
If it was that fun for us, imagine
how fun it was for the actors.

45
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,200
 What was that? 

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,160
 Just what was his situation? 

47
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,900
They get to live various lives.

48
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,570
The daughter of a wealthy family
or a mountain girl from Gangwon-do.

49
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,850
I bet it's thrilling. Right?

50
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,130
 He seemed to be hurt. Is he okay? 

51
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,350
 Should I have run after him? 

52
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,210
Do you hear me?

53
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,790
Who am I talking to? Hey, Ko Yeong Rye!

54
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,400
- What?
- Why?

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,530
I asked the question, so you should answer. Right?

56
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,800
Well, you know...

57
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,000
- about that guy.
- Guy?

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,400
- The male lead?
- No, not from the movie.

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,100
At the entrance of the theater. That male student.

60
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,850
- I wonder what his situation was.
- Hey. He's no student.

61
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,460
He's obviously a pervert.

62
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,040
There are people like him in theaters sometimes.

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,640
His uniform was probably a disguise, too.

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,280
I don't think that was the case, though.

65
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,940
I want to watch a movie again.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,970
 

67
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,880
The lines are spectacular.

68
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,980
 
"Whenever I swallowed my pride..."

69
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,870
 Pervert? 

70
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,550
 No way. 

71
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,860
"and asked to make love..."

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,310
Oh, my gosh! Make love! Oh, my gosh!

73
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,770
"You coldly rejected me."

74
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,220
"I'm human, too."

75
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,370
"I'm going to do exactly as you did."

76
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,480
- Gosh, my heart is pounding.
- Oh, my gosh...

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,850
I'm getting all riled up.

78
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,490
- Aema is truly a modern woman!
- Hey, Three Musketeers.

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,700
Ok Hui, you rub me today.

80
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,000
Me?

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
Yeah.

82
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,110
All right.

83
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,000
Where was I? Yes.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,300
- "I'll do exactly as you-"
- Hey.

85
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,100
Do you guys know any place with the name Giant?

86
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,020
Like Giant Arcade or Giant Billiards?

87
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,820
Have you seen any around?

88
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,000
Giant?

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why are you looking for it? Is it somewhere nice?

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,280
- I have no idea.
- It's not that...

91
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,660
What are you looking for?

92
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,690
Be more specific, so we can understand.

93
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,160
Nothing. Never mind if you don't know.

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,070
- Right. Tell us more.
- Continue.

95
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,910
Oppa.

96
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,940
What is it, Se Ri? Can't sleep?

97
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,690
Oppa!

98
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,530
What's wrong with your face?

99
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,180
Did Dad hit you again?

100
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,890
No, he didn't.

101
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,490
I slammed into a pole.

102
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,580
Stupid, aren't I?

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,590
Come here.

104
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,750
Aigoo, my goodness...

105
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,010
You can't sleep?

106
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,080
What song should I sing to help
Princess Se Ri fall asleep?

107
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,040
 ♫ Magical Princess Se Ri is here ♫ 

108
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,250
 ♫ She came to the Earth from another star ♫ 

109
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,700
- By the way, Oppa.
- Huh?

110
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,780
What is love?

111
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,960
Mom said she yearns for love.

112
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,780
I'm not sure.

113
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,910
I don't know since I haven't been in love, either.

114
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,040
But it's probably something really great.

115
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,320
If it's so great, why haven't you experienced it?

116
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,460
Because it's great.

117
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,450
I want to save it.

118
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,490
I see.

119
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,320
Go to sleep.

120
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,400
What the heck are you doing?

121
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,030
Why the hell are you feeling up her leg?

122
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,410
Were you dreaming?

123
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,370
- What kind of dream-
- I wasn't!

124
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,110
No, I wasn't. I didn't have a dream.

125
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,270
What dream?

126
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,610
It's already a f-fresh new day!

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,080
Oh, no!

128
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,740
Ow!

129
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,360
Unni!

130
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,040
Unni, are you okay? Is your butt okay?

131
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,300
W-Wait! Wait.

132
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,880
Hey, Ko Yeong Rye. What the hell?
Did you just push me?

133
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,010
No! I didn't. This towel isn't for feet-

134
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,860
So, w-what I'm saying is...

135
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm sorry, Unni.

136
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,980
The girls in our room keep getting weirder.

137
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,120
It's a total kiosk!

138
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,820
Unni, it's chaos. Not kiosk.

139
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,120
Whoa, Unni! It's okay! Hey!

140
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,870
Hey.

141
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,060
Hey!

142
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,860
What's with that Giant towel?

143
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,590
You're hiding something.

144
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,600
H-Hiding what?

145
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,040
My gut feeling tells me there's a man.

146
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,170
What man?

147
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,740
Judging by your face, I'm right.

148
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,870
Hey! Who is it? Huh? Fess up.

149
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,590
Who's Giant?

150
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,030
I said, you're wrong.

151
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,220
Hey.

152
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,240
Are you going to keep a secret from me?

153
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,480
Who is it? Huh? Who is it? Who?

154
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,590
I don't know.

155
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,940
It's a guy I don't know.

156
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,540
A guy she doesn't know?

157
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,440
Damn.

158
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,710
Which guy you don't know?

159
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,080
Get over here!

160
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,010
 Hey, Jae Pil. Have you heard? 

161
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,970
 Deok Goo and his guys were
called to the student office. 

162
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,980
 I heard a disciplinary committee
will be convened soon. 

163
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,610
Hey, hey.

164
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,070
What are you planning to do?

165
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,440
Question why we're not getting punished?

166
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,940
Deok Goo is competing
in the high school championship.

167
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,060
If he gets disciplined, he might
be unable to compete.

168
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,860
There's no use, man.

169
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,880
If you go and say, "Please punish me, too."

170
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,200
Do you think they'll listen and say "Okay"?

171
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,600
You'll just add fuel to the fire. Just stay put.

172
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,250
I guess having an influential dad
isn't always a good thing.

173
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,840
I feel so uncomfortable.

174
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,180
Young man.

175
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,280
Do you guys know where I can find
Jang Deok Goo from this class?

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,880
Are you Deok Goo's grandfather?

177
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,780
No. I'm Deok Goo's dad.

178
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,350
I'm sorry, but can you hand this to him?

179
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,900
I have to get to work.

180
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,410
Maybe he doesn't want to eat it
because I made it, but he leaves it behind.

181
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,900
Please let him know I put in extra care
today, and tell him to eat it.

182
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,420
Yes.

183
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,710
Well, then.

184
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,250
 

185
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,270
Are you here to gawk?

186
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,580
To see me sit here and write a written apology?

187
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,020
Your father asked me to give it to you.

188
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,770
Did you tell

189
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,900
my father what I'm doing here?

190
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,400
Get lost if you're finished.

191
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,680
He said to make sure you finish it.

192
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,830
He said today's is special.

193
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,160
 

194
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,650
 

195
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,670
How many reporters in total?

196
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,300
Hanseok Daily, Daeseong Daily,
Daily Seoul, and Economy Magazine.

197
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,460
There are a total of eight,
including photographers.

198
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,390
Please focus on our management
policy, emphasizing that

199
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,920
our Dongin Department Store plans to expand-

200
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,600
No!

201
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,050
This interview is for winning the
Outstanding Businessperson Award.

202
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,410
I should talk about myself. I'm the main topic.

203
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,920
Wait. It's my department store,
so is that about me as well?

204
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,900
What are you doing here? You should be at school.

205
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,380
Please make sure he doesn't get suspended.

206
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,920
- What?
- Deok Goo and his guys.

207
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,300
If Deok Goo gets suspended,
he can't compete in the championship.

208
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,400
- I'll resolve what's between us, so-
- Enough!

209
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,100
How will you survive in this rough
world while accommodating everyone?

210
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,810
Save the nonsense and step aside.

211
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,890
I have an interview.

212
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,800
Perfect. I have a complaint to report
to the education office.

213
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,730
I guess revealing it to the reporters
first isn't a bad idea.

214
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,400
A department store president, selected
as an outstanding businessperson,

215
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,160
abused his authority by suspending
the other kids in an assault case,

216
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,200
except for his own son.

217
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,470
The reporters will swarm in like moths to a flame.

218
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,920
Are you threatening your own father, you bastard?

219
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,150
Yes, I'm threatening you.

220
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,540
Since I know all too well that
begging won't work with you.

221
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,070
How about it? Should I go in?

222
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,830
Should I open the door?

223
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,850
Fine.

224
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,530
I'll see to it that they avoid suspension.

225
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,260
But instead,

226
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,970
I have one condition.

227
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,140
I was even threatened by my own son.

228
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,440
I should get something out of it, too.

229
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,970
Get tutoring.

230
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,670
At this rate, there's no way you'll
get into a prestigious university.

231
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,180
Deal.

232
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,950
And let me box. Just three times a week.

233
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,290
You arrogant bastard.

234
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,280
- Twice.
- Three.

235
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,250
I can't spare even one day.
It wouldn't be a workout otherwise.

236
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,610
This little prick.

237
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,890
In return, take your tutoring seriously
and improve your grades.

238
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,920
No slacking off. Understood?

239
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,420
All right.

240
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,690
Keep your promise.

241
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:47,140
Who does that punk take after to be so headstrong?

242
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,130
Why? What?

243
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,720
You've got something to say?

244
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
No, Sir.

245
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,100
Giant...

246
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,760
Giant.

247
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,550
Hey! Drive properly, will you?

248
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,180
I almost fell down!

249
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,350
I'm sorry. A car suddenly swerved into the lane.

250
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,610
 I almost got hurt. 

251
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,880
I found it! Giant.

252
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,150
Are you all right?

253
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

254
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,490
 

255
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,890
Ko Yeong Rye, where are you going?

256
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,370
- You're not going to eat?
- I'm not.

257
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,720
Hey, where are you going?

258
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,590
Enjoy your food.

259
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,670
Yeah, you, too.

260
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,160
Why are you alone? Where's Yeong Rye?

261
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,380
I don't know. She said she's not eating.

262
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,740
She rushed off somewhere.

263
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,410
How unlike our usual food fighter.

264
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,710
She wouldn't skip food unless she's carsick.

265
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,470
She's picky, but she never skips a meal.

266
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,070
I guess pigs do fly.

267
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,670
Geez. Whatever happened to kids these days?

268
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,620
A senior is sitting right here,

269
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,140
but neither newbie nor youngest
makes a move to fetch me water.

270
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,630
We used to be fast on our feet
back in my days. Right?

271
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,870
Hey, you brats. Are you deaf?

272
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,210
Unni said she's thirsty.

273
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,940
I'll be back in a jiffy.

274
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,750
It's fine.

275
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,410
I'll get it.

276
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,860
Please have some water, Senior.

277
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,730
Mr. Kim.

278
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,980
Ms. Kim, you got a perm?

279
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,710
You look pretty.

280
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,530
Enjoy your meal.

281
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,270
Ms. Choi is here, too. Ho Suk...

282
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,640
You got so pretty, Ho Suk.

283
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,380
- Did you get a boyfriend?
- Oh, gosh.

284
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,610
I have nothing of the sort.

285
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,670
You look like you'd have two or three.

286
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,760
I can't put my finger on what's changed.

287
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,970
Mr. Kim, there's a seat here.

288
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,280
Ms. Kwon, it's been a while. That seat's for me?

289
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,530
- Yes.
- Thank you.

290
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,040
Are you a newbie?

291
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,050
She is.

292
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,030
Please wait a moment.
I'll be back with your water.

293
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,310
Thank you, Ms. Kwon.

294
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,990
Ok Hui, please sit down.

295
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,820
Ok Hui, your perm was always like that. Right...

296
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,790
Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

297
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm usually not the clumsy type.

298
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,050
It's okay. That's cold.

299
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,020
What should I do? I'm so sorry, Mr. Kim.

300
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,310
I like warm water. But I see you got cold water.

301
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,360
- Your clothes are all wet.
- It's fine.

302
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,590
Don't worry. It's fine.

303
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,840
 

304
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,470
 

305
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,650
He didn't seem like the type
to come to a place like this.

306
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,910
Go ahead.

307
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,100
 Police crackdown! The police are here! 

308
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,610
 Get moving! 

309
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,040
Grab everyone!

310
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,210
I'm not!

311
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,280
- I'm not a minor.
- Come here.

312
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Grab them!

313
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,060
 

314
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,430
Why would you run away
when you're not even a minor?

315
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,640
Well, I was very scared.

316
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,380
I instinctively ran away since you chased me.

317
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,750
Gosh, what in the world...

318
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,210
Here.

319
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,120
Thank you.

320
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,450
 Hey, stand up straight, will you? 

321
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,090
 You guys are still too young... 

322
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,880
 Hurry up. 

323
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,050
Ko Yeong Rye?

324
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,280
Hey, Ko Yeong Rye.

325
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,460
Where have you been all this time?

326
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,790
Do you know what time it is?

327
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,500
Hey. Were you looking for that Giant guy-

328
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,310
Seo Jong Hui.

329
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,420
Give me a good slap.

330
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,580
What?

331
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,270
I need to get it together.

332
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,260
Go on and hit me. Hard.

333
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,050
For real?

334
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,160
Yes, for real.

335
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,710
I won't hold it against you.

336
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,250
Hit me.

337
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,450
W-Wait! Wait.

338
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,880
Don't hit me.

339
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,740
Just pinch me. That'd be better.

340
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,390
Where have you been?

341
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,570
So, did you get to meet Giant or not?

342
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,090
I'm going to forget about Giant now.

343
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,800
And...

344
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,210
I'm going to apply for that.

345
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:11,020
 

346
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,400
Attending school will definitely
give us a day off, right?

347
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,920
Yeah. I confirmed it. It's definite.

348
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,380
Man, studying really isn't my thing.

349
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,440
And there's another important fact.

350
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,930
A high school diploma is required
to become Miss Korea.

351
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,670
Everyone's so pretty.

352
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,980
We're pretty, too.

353
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,140
You mean, you are.

354
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,250
You're pretty, too.

355
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,530
Of course, I'm a smidge prettier.

356
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,560
So, you've decided to forget about Giant for good-

357
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,310
Why are you bringing that up again?
Don't talk about Giant from now on.

358
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,240
It's forbidden.

359
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,570
Giant-

360
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,400
Geez. We're stuck with having
to attend school now.

361
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,980
Would it hurt them to give us
a night school uniform, too?

362
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,940
Aren't they too discriminatory
between day and night classes?

363
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,730
Uniforms cost money.

364
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,140
We're basically attending for free.

365
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,690
That makes me sad.

366
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,760
Being sad is making me hungry.

367
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,990
Let's go eat.

368
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,490
Eat?

369
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,490
I know a great spot for soybean paste stew.

370
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,870
Want to go?

371
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,200
Let's go.

372
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,490
- Let's go.
- Go!

373
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,750
Here.

374
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,160
Ko Yeong Bae. Ko Yeong Mi.

375
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,310
- Noona!
- Unni!

376
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,440
Have you been well?

377
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,950
Say hi. She's my friend.

378
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,370
Hello.

379
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,360
You, too.

380
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,440
Hello.

381
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,560
Hi there, cuties.

382
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,390
I'm your sister's friend. Seo Jong Hui.

383
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,820
Here's a gift.

384
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,430
It's bread.

385
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,410
Whoa, it's bread!

386
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,190
Bread!

387
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,370
Drink this.

388
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,820
You, too, Yeong Bae.

389
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,890
Ko Yeong Mi. Do you know what four divided by four is?

390
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,260
No. What is it?

391
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,960
It's one. There are four people and four bread.

392
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,120
That means it's one bread per person.

393
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,270
I guess being good at math runs in the family.

394
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,730
But there's also something called a discount.

395
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,770
Here.

396
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,570
Consider yourself lucky today.

397
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,470
Sure.

398
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,530
Thank you.

399
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,330
Eat slowly.

400
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,390
Yeong Bae, do you want one, too?

401
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,800
- Mom.
- Geez, you're coming by too often.

402
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,340
I said sleep on your days off.
Why do you keep coming?

403
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,000
You're so stubborn.

404
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,700
My mom has a potty mouth.
She's actually happy to see me.

405
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,880
Happy, my ass.

406
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,990
That's one extra mouth to feed.

407
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,870
Who is this?

408
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:01,830
Hello, I'm Seo Jong Hui.
I share a room with Yeong Rye.

409
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,410
Is that so?

410
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,800
Your mom must make pretty songpyeon*.
(Half moon rice cake)

411
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,340
You're so pretty.*
(Making pretty songpyeon gives you pretty children)

412
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,650
Why don't you grab a bite while you're here?

413
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,270
You don't look like you'll eat much. That's good.

414
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,720
Let go.

415
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,610
It means she's happy to see you.

416
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,060
That's how my mom talks.

417
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,870
I understood perfectly fine.

418
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,470
Mom, will Oppa be late today?

419
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,550
It's been a while since I saw Oppa.

420
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,210
Hey, Bro.

421
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,210
Jeong Hyeon, hi.

422
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,350
Hey.

423
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,570
Being popular looks tiring.

424
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,210
Not for me.

425
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,460
If my smile can make someone happy.

426
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,760
Based on Article 2, Section 10
of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.

427
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,610
"All citizens shall have the
right to pursue happiness."

428
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,170
That's a stretch.

429
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,200
You just got here? I didn't see you in class.

430
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,270
No, I'm leaving. I skipped the lecture.

431
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,240
The weather was too nice,
so I photosynthesized on the lawn.

432
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,250
But why are you leaving already?

433
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,050
Oh, is today the day?

434
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,560
Your secret tutoring job.

435
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,130
Thanks for hooking me up.

436
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,490
I'll treat you when I get my first pay.

437
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,970
Forget it. Your mom already feeds
me too much for free.

438
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,390
You know it's my neighborhood, right?

439
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,540
I'll be waiting, so call me when you're done.

440
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,110
Why?

441
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,290
Again?

442
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,880
Section 17 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Korea.

443
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,530
"All citizens shall have their privacy
and freedom from intrusion protected."

444
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,660
Call me. I'll wait without having dinner.

445
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Please help yourself. You can relax.

446
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,150
All right.

447
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,620
The lady of Hwashin Electronics told me

448
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,790
you're an outstanding student even
at Minguk University.

449
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,050
So, I expected you to look nerdy.

450
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,880
But you're quite handsome.

451
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,140
Have you ever heard that you resemble Clark Gable?

452
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,340
You know, the actor from "Gone With the Wind."

453
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,450
Your eyes and jawline resemble his.

454
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,620
Oh, really?

455
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,330
Well, anyhow.

456
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,050
Our Jae Pil is pretty smart, too.

457
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,450
But he's having trouble coming out on top.

458
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,440
My husband worries since he's our only son.

459
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,550
By the way, do you have any siblings?

460
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,560
I have two younger sisters
and one younger brother.

461
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,230
I think she's around my brother's age. Hi.

462
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,290
Jae Pil should be done getting changed.

463
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,980
Shall we head up now, Mr. Ko?

464
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,200
S-Shall we? Where...

465
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,770
- The second floor. 
- The second floor. Okay.

466
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,120
A law major from a prestigious
university is tutoring illegally?

467
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,800
Wow.

468
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,180
Looks like one's grades and
character are inversely proportional.

469
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,120
Well, I don't know about that,

470
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,190
but poverty and conscience usually are.

471
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,920
Although you may never find out in your life.

472
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,460
For now, we'll mainly focus on
English and math. Today we'll do math.

473
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,250
Let's start by working on these.

474
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,640
I'm going to set a time limit, so use it wisely.

475
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,640
If grades and character are
inversely related, like you said,

476
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,950
your character must be outstanding.

477
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,500
You should study hard with
that outstanding character

478
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,030
and raise your grades, right?

479
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,610
Number one is usually hard to get wrong.

480
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,990
Having pulled off something this hard,
you'll easily overcome future challenges.

481
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,530
Since you're smart, apparently.

482
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,420
Shall we get started?

483
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,100
Okay.

484
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,470
Oh, my. Look at those dirty feet.

485
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,960
Were you rolling around in charcoal?

486
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,440
I bet crows would want to be friends with you.

487
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,870
- Yeong Rye.
- Yes?

488
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,370
Wash their feet.

489
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,490
Ko Yeong Bae. Ko Yeong Mi. Get up after two.

490
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,610
- One, two!
- One, two!

491
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,600
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

492
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,690
Let's go.

493
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,150
Put on your shoes.

494
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,530
Is that Yeong Rye's room?

495
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,890
Gross...

496
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,960
 

497
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,750
 

498
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,420
I have no idea what it says.

499
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,440
Who are you?

500
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,910
I'm Seo Jong Hui. I work with Yeong Rye.

501
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,360
I'm sorry for entering without permission.

502
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,940
No, it's fine.

503
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,100
Seo Jong Hui is a pretty name. Nice to meet you.

504
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,520
Who's that?

505
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,370
Oh, she's Yeong Rye's coworker. Seo Jong Hui.

506
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,290
- Do you know her?
- No.

507
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,400
I just met her.

508
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,540
Jong Hui, this is-

509
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,650
Oppa, when did you get home?

510
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,410
Jeong Hyeon is here again.

511
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,970
Hi, ugly.

512
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,880
It's been a while, and you got uglier.

513
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,600
He wasn't your brother?

514
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,280
No wonder.

515
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,310
Hello, Yeong Rye's oppa.

516
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,690
I'm Seo Jong Hui.

517
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,190
Okay.

518
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,670
What's going on?

519
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,850
Let's go outside.

520
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,720
- What a strange feeling.
- Go.

521
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,550
- Mom.
- Yeah?

522
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,700
Butternut squash in soybean
paste stew is a bit weird.

523
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,710
What's the problem?

524
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,790
It's still squash.

525
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,610
I snatched it up when the woman at the
market threw it out for being squished.

526
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,270
Gosh, Mother, that was a wise choice.

527
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,480
That was the secret ingredient
to this delicious flavor.

528
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,570
I don't need your flattery.

529
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,670
How is it? Is it edible?

530
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,640
I'll use fresher squash next time.

531
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,560
No, Mother. It tastes way
better than using zucchini.

532
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,250
Stop picking at your food and eat up.

533
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,010
Your eyes don't just look tired.

534
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,640
They're completely sunken in.

535
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,580
Are you a human or a skeleton?

536
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,280
Here. Eat up.

537
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,850
Okay.

538
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,360
What's wrong?

539
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,250
Hey, you-

540
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,030
No?

541
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,930
Geez.

542
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,410
Geez...

543
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,790
- Me? 
 - Yeah. Eat it.

544
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,410
Here. You two eat it.

545
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,940
Look at her!

546
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,060
Don't use your hands.

547
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,990
Take your time.

548
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,320
Goodness.

549
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,420
Don't fight.

550
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,210
That's right! Mom.

551
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:22,190
I applied for night school with Jong Hui.

552
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,880
What? You're better off
harvesting fur from a turtle.

553
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,520
Studying? Damn.

554
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,470
How will you pay for the tuition?

555
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,400
I don't need to pay tuition.

556
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,360
Our company will cover it.

557
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,440
The government pays them subsidies.

558
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,780
Even so, a lot of money will be needed overall.

559
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,750
You think bookbags and school supplies are free?

560
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,050
Don't worry, Mother.

561
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,070
The subsidies from the government
will cover pretty much everything.

562
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,460
Anyway, ugly.

563
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,180
A high school girl has got
to be pretty. You're in big trouble.

564
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,270
You'll get kicked out if you're ugly.

565
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,360
Seo Jong Hui! Don't laugh.

566
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,370
Don't react to what he says. Just eat.

567
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,340
Why?

568
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,950
Hey. You'll get kicked out.

569
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,110
You can probably set a record.

570
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,970
Jeong Sik, your sister is really ugly.

571
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,630
- Just eat.
- So, you're her brother?

572
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,950
- I'm her father. Just eat.
- Eat.

573
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,690
Really?

574
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,150
Why does that Oppa always eat at our house?

575
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,200
Are you sure his family is rich?

576
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,980
He likes our mom's cooking better
than his housekeeper's.

577
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,640
What is this?

578
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,430
You said you're attending school.

579
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,940
Use my old books as a reference.

580
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,600
Bye.

581
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,370
 

582
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,260
He acts like he doesn't care.

583
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,960
Let's go.

584
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,020
I mean, how can someone who's
so smart look so clean-cut, too?

585
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,810
Do they pick students based on looks?

586
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,520
I told you to interview the tutor.

587
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,340
Not hold an audition for an actor.

588
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,800
You're obsessed with looks.

589
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,700
If we're hiring one anyway,
he might as well be handsome.

590
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,640
In any case, I think he'll send
our Jae Pil to a top university.

591
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,720
I'm certain of it.

592
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,700
My intuition tells me this person is trustworthy.

593
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,570
Time will tell.

594
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,080
Water.

595
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,400
Jae Pil, where are you going at this hour?

596
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,760
The boxing gym.

597
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,970
Oh, my gosh. You must be crazy.

598
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,590
Your father will kill you. What's wrong with you?

599
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,950
Be back early.

600
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,100
Don't stay out too late.

601
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,910
That's a first.

602
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,850
He normally would've been furious.

603
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,240
That's unexpected of Mr. Han Gi Bok.

604
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,450
They say when someone suddenly
changes, it means their death is near.

605
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,290
Do you have something to say to me?

606
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,800
No.

607
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,780
Get going, then.

608
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,630
I find him more difficult than Han Gi Bok.

609
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,080
Here. Hit first.

610
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,550
One, two. One, two.

611
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,690
- One, upper.
- Wait, hold on.

612
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,340
Hey, so you're saying you're
free to come here now?

613
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,650
Yes. Yes, Sang Cheol. Yes.

614
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,540
It'll be the tenth time if you ask
one more time. Here.

615
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,390
Well, I just can't believe it, man.

616
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,920
What's gotten into your father?

617
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,980
He revoked the suspensions and even let you box.

618
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,000
They say when someone suddenly changes...

619
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,730
Anyway! That's unusual.

620
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,520
Come on.

621
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,890
Punch properly. Come here.

622
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,880
Hey. In celebration of your newfound freedom,

623
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,290
I'm planning something extraordinary.

624
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,800
- Are you done?
- You must join along.

625
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,300
- Can't refuse. Got it?
- Planning to cause trouble again?

626
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,810
It's not even close to trouble, man.

627
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,790
You know how our exam is coming up?

628
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,820
On the day it's over...

629
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,230
let's have a meeting. 4 vs. 4.

630
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:45,220
This Christmas, I want to have a merry Christmas with my girlfriend.

631
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,350
What about the girl from Ddo Ddo Bunsik?

632
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,880
Oh, her?

633
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,500
She's already in a relationship.

634
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,310
That's why I plan to have a meeting*.
(A group blind date)

635
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,860
Let's do this. How about it, Jae Pil?

636
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,250
Who has time for a meeting? Forget it, man.

637
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,520
Geez, why won't you?

638
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,660
You always say no to my plans.

639
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,030
Do you know the three most
important things in life?

640
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,420
Faith, hope, and love!

641
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,900
And the most important one is love. You know?

642
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,060
Don't regret it later.

643
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,900
Gratefully accept my invitation
while I'm offering it to you.

644
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,930
Who knows? You could meet an eternal love.

645
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,210
Okay. Cut the nonsense and come here.

646
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,960
Hey, you just said okay.

647
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,720
- Come on.
- You're going, okay?

648
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,890
Let's do this.

649
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,260
- Are you going or not?
- Throw a punch.

650
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,850
- Going or not? You're going, right?
- Do it right.

651
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,390
- You're going. You're going. 
 - Good.

652
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,620
You said you're going. You are.

653
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,760
 

654
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,390
Good day.

655
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,110
Gosh, I'm so tired...

656
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,420
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

657
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,990
Are you happy you're going to school?

658
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,570
Do they teach you anything good there?

659
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,550
Exactly.

660
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,940
This is so pretty-

661
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,730
Don't touch that!

662
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,020
Oh, my.

663
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,600
W-What do you think?

664
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,970
My furious acting was awesome, right?

665
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,540
I scared you, huh? Awesome, right?

666
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,080
You scared the heck out of me.

667
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,740
You scared me. You almost made
my non-existent baby pop out.

668
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,440
I almost cursed you out.

669
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,180
Anyway, you have the talent.

670
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,580
You could really become an actress.

671
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,840
- Yeah?
- Yes.

672
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,360
I agree after what we just saw.

673
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,490
Hey, Yeong Rye. We'll be late
for school. Let's hurry.

674
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,990
- Thanks for the compliment.
- Sure.

675
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,470
Watch out for cars.

676
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:58,490
 

677
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:04,450
Whoa, I'm at school.

678
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,040
Geez, I'm at school.

679
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,620
I never dreamed this could happen.

680
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,560
I can't believe I'm attending school.

681
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,690
You think I saw this coming?

682
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,850
Wow, studying?

683
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,690
How did I end up here? Gosh.

684
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,940
Here.

685
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,730
- What is this? 
 - I bought one for you.

686
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,170
A gift to commemorate our first day of school.

687
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,510
You're telling me to study hard
with this, aren't you?

688
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,890
Wow.

689
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:43,380
Wow, this is exactly what I wanted. Wow!

690
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:50,890
I just wish we could write
a new chapter in our lives together.

691
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:55,360
Thanks for attending school with me, Seo Jong Hui.

692
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,920
Hey. I won't be able to doze off
in class if you say that.

693
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,430
Geez. I totally got sucked into it
by Ko Yeong Rye.

694
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,870
That's right. I'm going to attack
the moment you doze off.

695
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,930
You're one terrifying bitch.

696
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:15,150
You're a fox disguised as a bear.

697
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,380
Okay. I'll always carry this with me

698
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,670
as a sign of my appreciation for your gift.

699
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,260
I don't know if I'll actually study
with this, though.

700
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,370
- Let's go.
- All right.

701
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,040
- What's that?
- Look at this.

702
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,720
 

703
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,890
That's adorable.

704
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,580
They're really adorable.

705
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,670
I should write a reply.

706
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,320
Excuse me. I left a mymy* in the desk.
(A portable media player)

707
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,200
Oh, here it is. Thank goodness.

708
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,670
Unni, you're the attendant for bus No.100, right?

709
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,840
You got me on that bus when I was almost tardy.

710
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,410
Oh! You're that girl from then.

711
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,760
That's right. We meet again, here.

712
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,950
- I'm so glad to see you!
- Me, too.

713
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,250
This is crazy. How is this possible?

714
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,830
Excuse me.

715
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,820
I was there, too.

716
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,610
You come here, too.

717
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,480
This is so neat!

718
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,560
- Mom.
- Yeah?

719
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,540
Why are we going home so early today?

720
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,400
We need days like this, too.

721
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,020
We used up all the sugar for today.

722
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,260
And we even had a full house of horse customers.

723
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,170
If every day were like today,
we'd be rich in no time.

724
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,920
Really? Are we rich, Mom?

725
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,360
Sure. This much would be enough to make us rich.

726
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,220
Yeong Bae. Yeong Mi. Stand in front of me.

727
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,720
Okay!

728
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,420
Here.

729
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,740
Go buy a popsicle.

730
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,100
Wow, a popsicle!

731
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,080
Let's go, Yeong Mi.

732
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:26,810
Oh, gosh. How can they be so happy?

733
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,420
Oh, my gosh!

734
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,380
My gosh!

735
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,530
Oh, gosh.

736
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,900
Ouch...

737
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,880
 Ko Yeong Rye, hurry home! 

738
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,880
 Your mom got hurt in an accident. 

739
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,160
Mom!

740
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:18,070
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

741
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,370
Goodness. What's wrong?

742
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,070
I'm still alive.

743
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,720
Don't make such a big deal.

744
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,810
What happened?

745
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,260
How did... How did this...

746
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,020
She fell back going uphill with the cart.

747
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,140
Her knees and arms are scratched up.

748
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,030
I said let's go to the hospital
to check for internal injury.

749
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,500
But she's being stubborn.

750
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,040
Why are you being like that, Mom?
You're killing me.

751
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,740
We should go to a hospital.

752
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,210
Forget the hospital.

753
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,190
Stop talking rubbish.

754
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,950
The hospital isn't important right now.

755
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,670
That cart over there. What should we do with that?

756
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,570
I begged and begged the kitty party leader

757
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,370
to give me number 1, and barely managed to buy it.

758
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,200
I still have a year left on the payment.

759
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,560
What will we do now that it's broken?

760
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,990
- Mom.
- Mom!

761
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,470
You can't escape fate.

762
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,910
I had to jinx it by saying
business was great today.

763
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:22,020
That fed our family of five.
What are we going to do?

764
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,650
- My poor children. What am I going to do...
- Mom...

765
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,070
Mom.

766
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,580
Mom...

767
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,970
 

768
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,460
Please get in one at a time.

769
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,340
Please hurry.

770
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,530
All right!

771
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,120
 Mr. No. 

772
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,120
Could you please help me this once?

773
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,640
Just once, Mr. No.

774
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,680
My situation is truly urgent.

775
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,630
Yeong Rye, is it that urgent?

776
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,740
Yes.

777
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,190
Mine is more urgent.

778
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:19,730
Do you know how much HQ
pressures me about our earnings?

779
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:23,230
It's going to kill me. But I want to live long.

780
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:24,430
Mr. No...

781
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,730
That's enough. Everyone's got their stories.

782
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,450
Someone's parent is on their deathbed.

783
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,510
Someone's family goes bankrupt because of a flood.

784
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:35,770
If we listen to everyone's situation, how will the company be sustained?

785
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,950
Is the company your moneybag?

786
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,460
You think we've got money to burn?

787
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,360
Does money grow on trees?

788
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:45,050
If two months' worth is too much,
then just one month's-

789
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,890
Hey. What if you run with the advance?

790
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,620
How will I manage that?

791
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,390
I'm so frustrated. Seriously.

792
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:54,550
You know I'm not that kind of person.

793
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,420
Mr. No, I won't run away.

794
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,100
I swear to God. Truly.

795
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,320
Swear?

796
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,300
 I'm the last person to trust swears. 

797
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,800
 To trust people, no less! 

798
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,060
 No way! Get out. 

799
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,060
 Mr. No, please. I have nowhere to turn to. 

800
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,000
 Be quiet! Get out. Get to work. 

801
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,780
 Get out. Get out! 

802
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,080
What brings you here?

803
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,180
I'm sure you didn't come to visit with us.

804
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:44,540
Uncle, the money you borrowed from Father.

805
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,490
Could you return that?

806
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,150
What?

807
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:53,930
People in this family are always
whining about borrowed money.

808
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,740
Your mom also caused a scene here
when your brother got into college.

809
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:02,090
How many times must I tell you
I already repaid that money?

810
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,260
But you didn't.

811
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,580
We know everything.

812
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,000
Then, please lend us some.

813
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,190
I'll pay you back.

814
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:23,350
Mom got into an accident and broke the handcart.

815
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,310
Mom also got injured,
but she won't go to the hospital.

816
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:28,960
I-I'll pay you back.

817
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,130
I'll do whatever it takes to pay you back-

818
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,560
Business is slow for us, too.

819
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,810
We don't have any money. Nothing.

820
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:45,190
And quite frankly, your mom is the one who basically cut all ties.

821
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:48,240
She never called us on holidays and ignored us.

822
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,480
Only when she needs money... Gosh, seriously.

823
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,440
Take this for your ride back.

824
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:39,900
 ♫ Carrying the weight of a weary day ♫ 

825
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:47,310
 ♫ I wonder what's being achieved ♫ 

826
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:54,700
 ♫ Nothing goes the way I hoped ♫ 

827
00:55:54,700 --> 00:56:02,500
 ♫ Yet I can't bring myself to stop ♫ 

828
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:15,280
 ♫ The dreams I wanted to reach slip further away ♫ 

829
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:24,870
 ♫ And the day I can't hold onto,
at the end of my day ♫ 

830
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:32,380
 ♫ What's making it crumble? ♫ 

831
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:39,740
 ♫ I don't know anything ♫ 

832
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:47,280
 ♫ Everything feels too hard
since it's the first time ♫ 

833
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:54,820
 ♫ I can't throw a tantrum like a child ♫ 

834
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:01,690
 ♫ I'm still a nobody ♫ 

835
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:31,420
 ♫ Someday, will I be able
to rescue myself, as I am? ♫ 

836
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:39,840
 ♫ I don't know anything ♫ 

837
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:47,280
 ♫ Everything feels too hard
since it's the first time ♫ 

838
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:54,760
 ♫ I can't throw a tantrum like a child ♫ 

839
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:02,520
 ♫ I'm still a nobody ♫ 

840
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:09,730
 ♫ I want to do everything well ♫ 

841
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:17,390
 ♫ But even I'm too much for myself ♫ 

842
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:24,950
 ♫ How much of me must I cast away? ♫ 

843
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:32,010
 ♫ Before I can truly become me ♫ 

844
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:49,740
 ♫ While I go about my day,
which no one cares about ♫ 

845
00:58:51,600 --> 00:59:05,500
 ♫ May all the tears shine like
stars in the night someday ♫ 

846
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:20,090
 ♫ Gently, tenderly, and beautifully ♫ 

847
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,090
Geez, what's going on?

848
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,050
I'm fine.

849
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,910
Seriously. You crazy bitch.

850
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:31,490
You should've at least bought a cheap umbrella.

851
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:34,220
Why would you walk around in the rain?

852
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,500
What if you catch a cold?

853
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,780
Gosh. What the hell happened to your nails?

854
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,850
What happened?

855
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:47,270
I'm a real shitshow, huh?

856
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,990
Gosh, stay put. I'll look for a Band-Aid.

857
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:55,020
You're really something, Ko Yeong Rye.

858
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,050
Ms. Kye is making a fuss that our room
is the only one short on deposits.

859
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,250
Don't you dare skip work because you get sick.

860
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,850
I'll kill you.

861
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,080
The rest of you go to sleep!

862
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,410
You'd better listen to Unni, you brats.

863
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,290
How did you hurt yourself?

864
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,190
I'm all right.

865
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,730
If those were all money,

866
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:49,650
even if I'd have to stay up all night,

867
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,170
I'd pick them...

868
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,080
again and again.

869
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,320
What are you doing?

870
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,440
You can come in.

871
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,110
What are you doing, Ms. Ko?

872
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,430
Cleaning under the moonlit sky
instead of exercising?

873
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,620
I won't want to in the morning,
so I'm doing it now.

874
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,380
That's true.

875
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,600
Cleaning at 4 a.m. isn't easy.

876
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,770
But I'd still rather do it tomorrow.

877
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,880
You're feeling troubled
by your mom's accident, right?

878
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,550
Don't you know I have superpowers?

879
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:25,450
I'm actually an alien from the star, Andromeda.

880
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:30,790
So, I can read the minds of humans.

881
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,980
- "Really?"
- Yes.

882
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,870
That's what I want to say.

883
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,680
But I don't have the energy today.

884
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,710
How did you find out?

885
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,840
I just happened to.

886
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,660
Here.

887
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,440
W-Why are you...

888
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,560
A gift.

889
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,050
You gave me a gift, too.

890
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:18,960
He has quite a full stomach despite his looks.

891
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,530
W-What is all this?

892
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,570
Buy your mom a new handcart and horses.

893
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,420
I'm not giving it to you. I'm lending it to you.

894
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,300
You can pay me back later
when you get your teacher's salary.

895
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,760
I won't charge interest.

896
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,580
No! I can't take this. How could I
accept such a huge amount?

897
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,350
Take it.

898
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,640
This money is meant to be used like this.

899
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,220
End of discussion.

900
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,890
Jong Hui, this isn't right.

901
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,110
Just take it, will you?

902
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:11,800
In return, I'll save a wish
for you to grant as a bonus.

903
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,760
You need to grant my wish, okay?

904
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,680
But how could I accept this?

905
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,010
Just take it.

906
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:24,770
I'll be hurt if you don't.

907
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,030
If you insist,

908
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,000
you can pay me back every month.

909
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,680
Hey.

910
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,660
What the?

911
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,700
Ko Yeong Rye, are you crying?

912
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,360
I'm not. It's the rain.

913
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,960
It stopped raining a while ago.

914
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:01,220
Wow, Ko Yeong Rye.

915
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:04,210
You're quite easy. All it took was money.

916
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:10,210
Yes, money makes me move. I love money.

917
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,090
So what?

918
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:30,700
Anyhow...

919
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:37,300
after going through this situation,

920
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,290
I felt that money is essential.

921
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,000
It made me come to my senses.

922
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,200
If Mom had seriously gotten hurt...

923
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,650
Money is scary.

924
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:07,630
Did you just realize that?

925
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:25,860
I started writing in my diary.

926
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,610
With the pen you gave me.

927
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:33,350
But do you know what I write the most?

928
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:36,490
"I hung out with Yeong Rye.

929
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,140
It was fun.

930
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,580
I laughed a lot. I was happy."

931
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,460
Those words usually had nothing to do with me.

932
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,230
But life is fun now, thanks to you.

933
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,140
So...

934
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:59,140
that's nothing.

935
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,960
You're giving me something much more valuable.

936
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,640
What you just said...

937
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,030
was a bit cheesy, Seo Jong Hui.

938
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,840
I know.

939
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,200
I regretted it the moment I said it.

940
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,590
 ♫ Disappears... ♫ 

941
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:00,760
Oh? It's my favorite song.

942
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:06,500
 ♫ It disappears ♫ 

943
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:13,410
 ♫ You and I, so dearly bound as one ♫ 

944
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:17,040
 ♫ Where will we meet again? ♫ 

945
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,440
 ♫ And what will have become of us? ♫ 

946
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,330
 ♫ When I think of you ♫ 

947
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:29,200
 ♫ A flower comes to mind ♫ 

948
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:36,950
 ♫ I'll hide among its petals and wait ♫ 

949
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,300
 ♫ You and I, so dearly bound as one ♫ 

950
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,190
 

951
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,970
The horses are shining.

952
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:52,070
They look way more handsome
than our previous ones.

953
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:54,660
They look expensive.

954
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,430
You really bought them with an advance from work?

955
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,070
What's gotten into that shitty Mr. No?

956
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:04,370
Yeong Rye is exceptionally good at her job.

957
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:07,540
It'd be his loss if she leaves,
so he's sucking up to her.

958
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:10,310
He has an eye for people.

959
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,830
I can open for business tomorrow.

960
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:16,400
Mom!

961
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,870
No, no. You can't work yet.

962
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:21,200
Take the week off and start next week.

963
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,790
Forget that. I feel sore from
resting the past few days.

964
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:26,910
I'm perfectly fine.

965
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,630
Perfectly fine, my foot.

966
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:31,150
You still look like a patient.

967
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,390
Go inside and rest. I'll set up the blankets.

968
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,750
- I'm fine!
- Go inside.

969
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,160
Go inside.

970
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,770
When did you get so strong?

971
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,880
Gosh. I'm okay.

972
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,530
Go inside.

973
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,710
Yeong Rye told me.

974
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:56,060
Thank you. We'll pay you back.

975
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,610
Pay me back?

976
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,960
You really are siblings.

977
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,020
I don't need the money any time soon.

978
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:11,930
If you want to pay me back, play rock-paper-scissors with Yeong Rye.

979
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,380
I'm one step behind.

980
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,340
Stop.

981
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,860
Hands above your head.

982
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,570
Pass them up from the back.

983
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,410
Here.

984
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:49,030
I always get a herniated disc during exam period.

985
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,480
Maybe from sleeping on my stomach.

986
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,830
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.

987
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,140
Way to go, man.

988
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,220
Shit! You'll mess up my hair, man!

989
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,580
I spent the entire morning fixing my hair.

990
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:00,610
Damn, it's so sticky.

991
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:02,400
What the hell? Is that mousse?

992
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,600
- Of course, it is.
- Why?

993
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,840
As I announced beforehand,

994
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,680
today is the last meeting of our 12th grade.

995
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,850
You're going, right?

996
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,390
I made it clear I'm not going. You can go.

997
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:17,980
Damn it. Hey! Can't you grant your friend a wish?

998
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:21,020
I already matched the headcount.

999
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,370
Handsome, cool, and loyal Jae Pil.

1000
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,610
Hyung!

1001
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,760
Hyung? You bastard. You only
call me that when you need me.

1002
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,290
- Hyung, please.
- No.

1003
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:31,430
- Please. Just one hour.
- I'm not going.

1004
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:35,810
Just one hour. Just one hour! Please.

1005
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:38,100
I'll be good to you. Just one hour-

1006
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,490
Hyung!

1007
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:42,350
Please.

1008
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:44,340
So Yeong and Jeong Yi had agreed,

1009
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,370
but they got tickets to Top 10 Songs and took off.

1010
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,410
Please help me out this once.

1011
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,210
It's a 4 vs. 4 meeting.
It can't be just the two of us.

1012
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:54,190
No. I don't like meetings.

1013
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:56,370
Yeah. We always end up with losers.

1014
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,220
There are good catches this time.

1015
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,720
For real.

1016
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,420
- Forget it.
- You go.

1017
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,240
I'll... I'll give you my mymy.

1018
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,500
You two can listen to music.

1019
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,880
Please.

1020
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:15,750
Deals like this among friends aren't appropriate.

1021
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,010
How many do you need for the meeting?

1022
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,200
Two?

1023
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,260
Okay.

1024
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,670
We'll go instead.

1025
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:26,990
Hey, Seo Jong Hui. What are you saying?

1026
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:29,620
We need to attend class.

1027
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:44,210
We can't go to a meeting.

1028
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,930
We can't. That's absurd.

1029
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:48,740
Why is that absurd?

1030
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,970
I've always wanted to join a meeting.

1031
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,530
Let's try it out.

1032
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:55,260
What about class?

1033
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:00,960
And I don't feel comfortable
acting like a day student.

1034
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,790
Why? I think it'll be fun.

1035
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:06,560
Joo Kyeong can lend us uniforms, too.

1036
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,180
Let's try this, Ko Yeong Rye.

1037
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,210
No. No, I can't.

1038
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:16,980
You can tell right away when I'm lying. I can't.

1039
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,570
Hey. Lying improves with practice.

1040
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,810
Let's go.

1041
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,180
Okay. Then...

1042
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,920
I'll use my wish right now.

1043
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,700
You know the wish I saved?
The one you have to grant.

1044
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,600
- You didn't forget, did you?
- Wait, that's...

1045
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,000
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1046
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,440
I'll give you one hour.

1047
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,040
I'm going boxing in an hour.

1048
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,170
Yes, yes. Do whatever, Hyung.

1049
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,160
Just leave after sitting there for a bit.

1050
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,950
Mr. Han Jae Pil, you're only for display
to raise our standards anyway.

1051
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,310
They're here.

1052
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:39,790


1053
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:52,940
 ♫ When darkness falls in my quiet heart ♫ 

1054
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:59,610
 ♫ Outside is filled with so many stars ♫ 

1055
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:06,400
 ♫ You, who loved purple ♫ 

1056
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:13,480
 ♫ You are my little garden ♫ 

1057
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,540
 ♫ My sky, which has forgotten words ♫ 

1058
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,400
 - Today was fun-
- Bye! 

1059
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,930
 Hey, wait. You're leaving like this? 

1060
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,560
 Do you even plan to see her again? 

1061
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,180
 I've devised an exceptional plan. 

1062
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,210
 What are you scheming? 

1063
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:28,840
 A boxing gym event? 

1064
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,560
 The handsome one said he
really wants you to come. 

1065
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,730
 He must've fallen for Yeong Rye. 

1066
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,010
 

1067
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,320
 It's probably not like that. 

1068
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,090
 You're going today, right? 

1069
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:41,460
 - Hi.
- Hi. 

1070
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,280
 Let's go. I think it'll be fun. 

1071
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:54,440
 Stop! 

1072
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,010
 That's enough.
