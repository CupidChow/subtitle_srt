1
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,040
Mr. No.

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,230
Please help me this time.

3
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,970
I beg of you. Please.

4
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,970
My mom went through surgery.

5
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,220
If you can adjust my dispatch schedule this week,

6
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,750
I'll work without any days off.

7
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,500
I'll tally the deposits, too.

8
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,900
- I'm good at math and abacus-
- Geez, forget it!

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,600
I don't need any of that.

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,200
We're short on attendants as it is.

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,660
- Manager No, please-
- Manager or not, I said no!

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,950
Think about it.

13
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,890
If I listen to everyone's situation,

14
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,710
do you think I can run the company or not?

15
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,500
If you insist on making a hole* on the schedule,
(Not showing up for work)

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,710
just quit. Clean and simple.

17
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,070
The only hole around here is in your sock.

18
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,430
Who'll stitch up that hole in your sock, Mr. No?

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,480
Your elderly mother will, right?

20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,370
Since you couldn't get married all this time.

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,250
Be quiet if you're not going
to stitch it up for me.

22
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,500
They opened up her mother's stomach
and performed surgery on her.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,510
How could you deny her without hesitation?
You're too cruel.

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,100
We'll cover Yeong Rye's dispatch.

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,640
That works, right?

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,360
Girls...

27
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,840
You girls are being ridiculous.

28
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,090
What a loyal lot of friends you are!

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,930
But that's too bad.

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,740
You two aren't enough to cover her.

31
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,920
Do you think I'd accept your request or not? Huh?

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,390
Ms. Ko, you think I'd accept it or not?

33
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,880
Then, I'll cover her, too.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,260
I think the three of us will be
enough to cover her dispatches.

35
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,200
Jong Hui.

36
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,780
Aren't you guys all pushing it
too hard because of me?

37
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,780
It's going to be tough without any days off.

38
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,350
What? Among us? What are friends for?

39
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,850
I'm about to feel hurt.

40
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,740
She's right. To put it bluntly,

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,750
wouldn't you help us out
if we were in your situation?

42
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,070
Yeah. We all have to help each other out.

43
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,630
Right?

44
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,520
Anyway, how long will they be like that?

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,050
They're making us uncomfortable, too.

46
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,770
All over a gigolo.

47
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,220
A friendship thinner than
tissue paper just ripped apart.

48
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,550
Exactly.

49
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,520
They used to be glued together. Really.

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,400
I don't get it, either.

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,800
There's a sea of men out there.
Must they be like that?

52
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,780
 Here. 

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,420
 Can you give this to Seo Jong Hui? 

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:32,150
 

55
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,500
 

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,050
Stupid. Idiot. Dumbass.

57
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,800
Loser. Fool-

58
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,900
That won't do it. You have to slam it harder.

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,830
Hey. If I find a time machine,

60
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,400
I'd go back to the event match without hesitation.

61
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,820
I'd block Deok Goo's moves in advance
and knock him out with an uppercut.

62
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,450
Then, Yeong Rye would say,

63
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,790
"Oh, Sang Cheol. You're so manly and cool.

64
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,950
I've fallen head over heels for you."

65
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,470
Right?

66
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,970
Crazy bastard.

67
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,230
Right. I look crazy to you, too, right?

68
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,250
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

69
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,370
Now that I think it's over,

70
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,690
I feel more regretful and miss her more.

71
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,260
Then, why don't you visit her at the hospital?

72
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,140
Hospital? Visit who?

73
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,210
Aigoo, what a nuisance.

74
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,150
I told you to go.

75
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,880
Aigoo, you're so stubborn.

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,770
I haven't seen anyone more stubborn than you.

77
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,530
It's fine.

78
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,520
My coworkers said they'll cover me at work.

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,600
Hey. Then, at least stop by home.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,530
See what the kids are up to,

81
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,530
do the laundry, and make a few side dishes.

82
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,490
Yeong Sik can't handle it on his own.

83
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,300
He already has his plate full
with studying and tutoring.

84
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,240
You're only worried about Oppa
even in this situation?

85
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,360
Of course. He's the pillar of our family.

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,150
Then, what am I?

87
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,900
You're...

88
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,730
my daughter. My eldest daughter.

89
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,820
Right.

90
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,170
I'm the eldest daughter.

91
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,840
One who must earn money and
look after her younger siblings.

92
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,870
Even my mom treats me like this.

93
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,290
Who would consider me precious and like me, right?

94
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,290
Look at this girl.

95
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,570
Did you swallow a pickaxe today?

96
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,530
Why are your words so spikey?

97
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,710
I don't know.

98
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,240
I can't help how my words are coming out today.

99
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,210
The pillar is here.

100
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,430
I'll go to take care of the kids, do laundry,
and make side dishes.

101
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,750
You look after Mom, Mr. Pillar.

102
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,110
Don't eat the entire can of peaches.

103
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,160
Feed Mom, too.

104
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,170
- What's up with her?
- I don't know.

105
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,270
I wonder if something's going on at work.

106
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,040
Stomp, stomp, stomp!

107
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,740
 Get clean. Get clean. 

108
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,000
- Jong Hui, I'm good at this, right?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,890
- I'm good too, right?
- The best! Work harder!

110
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,700
Jong Hui.

111
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,440
- Unni!
- Noona!

112
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,260
You're here.

113
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,630
What brings you here without a word?

114
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,010
When did you get here?

115
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,650
A little bit ago.

116
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,270
Over there.

117
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,500
You couldn't attend class last night.

118
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,230
You know I don't usually take notes, right?

119
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,660
I wrote away with the pen you gifted me.

120
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,270
Don't complain if you see
a few worms here and there.

121
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,870
I did my best to stay awake.

122
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,440
Stomp! Stomp!

123
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,320
What are you doing? We have to feed the kids.

124
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,810
Right? They're probably really
hungry after all this labor.

125
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,110
- Right? You're hungry, right?
 - Yes! 

126
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,940
All right. I'll whip something up.

127
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,750
I love your flower bed.

128
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,150
The flowers are pretty

129
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,690
and the vegetable garden is nice, too.

130
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,320
Your mother is feeling all better, right?

131
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,860
Yeah.

132
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,690
But I'm not letting her get discharged
until she's fully recovered.

133
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,970
She might insist on working right away.

134
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,150
Yeah. I think your mother is more
than willing to do that.

135
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,800
You don't know how shocked I was
when I heard she underwent surgery.

136
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,790
The sky turned yellow.

137
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,170
That should never happen again.

138
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,540
Here.

139
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,440
J-Jong Hui.

140
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,810
Yeah?

141
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,000
Here.

142
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,510
What's that?

143
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,020
On the day Mom collapsed,

144
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,080
I ran into Han Jae Pil on the street.

145
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,740
Han Jae Pil?

146
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,060
 

147
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,620
Oh, yeah.

148
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,710
I was frantically trying to catch a taxi

149
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,500
when he showed up and gave us
a ride to the hospital.

150
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,430
- With his family's car.
- Really?

151
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,380
How grateful.

152
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,020
He asked me to give that to you.

153
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,300
- Me?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,660
You know how they invited us to the boxing gym?

155
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,190
It must've been because of you.

156
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,700
I didn't even realize that

157
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,840
and counted my chickens before they hatched.

158
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,950
Really?

159
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,020
What a funny guy.

160
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,650
I don't know about funny.

161
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,340
Anyway, I gave it to you.

162
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,010
Mission complete.

163
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,140
And you?

164
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,650
Weren't you interested in him, too?

165
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,670
Me?

166
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,700
No. I thought he was interested in me.

167
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,610
So I considered giving him a chance. That's all.

168
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,400
I don't like him.

169
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,140
He's not even my type.

170
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,650
Really?

171
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,190
Why?

172
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,400
You don't like him?

173
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,030
Like or not.

174
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm not interested in dating.

175
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,590
Nor can I afford to.

176
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,340
And...

177
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,250
he doesn't know anything about me.

178
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,960
I'll go get more chips.

179
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,760
You want some, too, right?

180
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,340
Really?

181
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,860
You met her on the street? Randomly?

182
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,800
Yeah.

183
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
That should've been me!

184
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,140
I should've given her a ride even if
I had to borrow the rice store's truck.

185
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,960
Should I pay a visit?

186
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,390
Go ahead.

187
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,200
I don't know if she'll welcome you, though.

188
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,370
Hey, let's go together.

189
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,330
At least, you have a reason
since you gave her a ride.

190
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,760
I have a reason,

191
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,820
but I don't need to go out of my way-

192
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,380
Out of your... What?

193
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,780
Let's go.

194
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,630
Let's go. I'll go with you.

195
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,860
Really? Really? Really?

196
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,240
My heart is racing.

197
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,170
Should we buy something? Flowers? Fruits?

198
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,470
Hey. I'm hiccoughing. Look! Hey, hey.

199
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,970
Hi.

200
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,290
H-Hi.

201
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,880
Hi.

202
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,590
Well, I heard from Jae Pil.

203
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,120
It's one thing if I didn't know.
But now that I know,

204
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,500
I felt it was my duty as your friend.

205
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,690
Of course, we can't say we're friends
or we're not friends.

206
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,850
Our relationship is difficult to label.

207
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,790
What, Jae Pil?

208
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,510
He thought you might be sick of hospital food.

209
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,510
Yeah.

210
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,480
Sang Cheol's parents run a store at the market.

211
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,640
Yeah. A small restaurant.

212
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,990
But it's somewhat big for a market stall.

213
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,390
They sell salted and pickled foods.

214
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,870
It's surprisingly lucrative.

215
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,430
I'm not bragging,

216
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,580
but the neighbors all say we're the real deal.

217
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,530
They love it.

218
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,850
O-Oh! H-Here you go.

219
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,540
- Thanks. We'll enjoy it.
- Sure.

220
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,260
How's your mother feeling? Is she better?

221
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,470
Yes, thanks to you.

222
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,610
As a matter of fact, she asked who gave us a ride

223
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,490
- and said she's grateful.
- Oh, no.

224
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,430
Of course, a ride is given.

225
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,170
Hey.

226
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,700
Can I talk to you?

227
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,690
Huh?

228
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,030
Hey.

229
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,280
Yeah?

230
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,440
The note I gave you last time.

231
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,450
Yeah.

232
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,250
You gave it to her, right? What did she say?

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,130
Well...

234
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,710
I don't think Jong Hui wants to date
anyone at the moment.

235
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,250
Oh, really?

236
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,720
Then, why did she join the meeting?

237
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,610
Was it just for fun?

238
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,180
Well, that's understandable.

239
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,220
Understandable.

240
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,070
Sorry for the trouble.

241
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,980
You've got your hands full with
your mother being sick. I feel bad.

242
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,650
No. No, it's fine. It's okay...

243
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,410
You made all that fuss,
saying you weren't interested.

244
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,700
Acting stone-faced.

245
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,870
That's enough.

246
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,750
A total wolf in sheep's clothing, huh?

247
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,430
Awoo!

248
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,330
I said, enough. Say one more word.

249
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,930
When did you fall for her?

250
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,290
When Jong Hui took off her
jacket at the skating rink?

251
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,370
Or when she yelled out "Stop"?

252
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,000
Was it love at first sight?

253
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,060
Wow, you were giving me crap
when I was thinking about Yeong Rye.

254
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,330
But you stayed up all night
thinking about Jong Hui.

255
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,780
That's what happened!

256
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,580
- All right! I'll stop!
- I said that was enough.

257
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,520
Hyung! Hyung! I'll stop.

258
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,280
I'll stop. All right, I'll stop.

259
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,520
What's wrong with you?

260
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,430
Hey, Jae Pil. Tell me anything you want to eat.

261
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,230
I'll treat you in consolation
for being completely rejected!

262
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,930
I'll treat you! It's my treat!

263
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,100
I said I'll treat you!
What's the problem? My treat!

264
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,760
Oh, when did you get here?

265
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,960
You must not be the sensitive type.
Sleeping anywhere like that.

266
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm sensitive.

267
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,270
I've simply adapted since I sleep outside a lot.

268
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,100
Kids, your brother is home.

269
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,620
Oh, Hyung.

270
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,070
Oppa.

271
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,430
Did you guys get along?

272
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,370
- Yes.
- Yeah.

273
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,710
Oppa. Look at this.

274
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,580
Jong Hui drew this for me.

275
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,860
She's good, right?

276
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,620
Wow. What terrible drawing skills.

277
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,990
Agreed.

278
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,410
I don't need to be good at everything.

279
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,180
Let's play inside.

280
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,820
Oh, you haven't eaten yet, right?

281
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,600
Yeong Rye made kimchi stew and
some side dishes. Should I set up the table?

282
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,860
No, it's fine. You should go.
You need to rest, too.

283
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,400
You'll be tired if you don't rest on your day off.

284
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,020
You'll leave the kids by themselves
while you tutor later?

285
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,120
Yeong Mi said it's scary at night.

286
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,860
Leave that to me.

287
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,040
- Thanks for everything.
- Geez.

288
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,730
Why do I feel like I'm getting kicked
out when I did a good deed?

289
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,100
You smiled.

290
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,000
So, you know how to smile?

291
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,500
Wow, I thought you had a disease
that prevented you from smiling.

292
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,810
Aren't you leaving?

293
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,370
I'm leaving.

294
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
- How about this?
- That's nice, too.

295
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,700
Exactly. But this suits me better.

296
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,310
You're right.

297
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,830
It's boring by myself.

298
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,690
I miss Ko Yeong Rye.

299
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,420
 

300
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,820
Huh?

301
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,500
Isn't that her? Seo Jong Hui?

302
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,380
 

303
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,490
 

304
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,810
Isn't this good?

305
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,600
- Hyung!
- Is it good?

306
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,530
Okay, tell me one more time.

307
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,620
You'll do what until I finish tutoring?

308
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,450
Sit here quietly.

309
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,450
Don't move a single step.

310
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,080
That's right.

311
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,050
- Yeong Bae, look after Yeong Mi.
- Yeah.

312
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,100
If she needs the bathroom,
let the Supermarket ahjumma know.

313
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,720
- I spoke to her already.
- Okay.

314
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,900
I'll buy you something even better after I'm done.

315
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,420
Something better? What? Like jjajangmyeon?

316
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,160
That sounds good.

317
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,070
- Oh, Mr. Ko.
- Hello.

318
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,680
Who are they?

319
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,630
Your siblings?

320
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,340
- Hello.
- Hi.

321
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,160
What are they doing here?

322
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,270
Are you making them wait here?

323
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,630
Yes. We have no choice since
my mother is in the hospital.

324
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,840
Oh, I see.

325
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,440
Gosh, that's absurd.

326
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
You can't leave two kids unattended
in this day and age.

327
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,990
One looks to be about Se Ri's age

328
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,200
and the other one looks even younger.

329
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,710
Stop that.

330
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,900
What is it?

331
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,620
You didn't have dinner yet, right?

332
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,190
Here.

333
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,530
I'm not sure if you'll like omurice.

334
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,460
Se Ri likes it.

335
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,600
Do you like it?

336
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,920
Yes.

337
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,150
Okay, that's good.

338
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,120
Dig in then.

339
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,650
Eat up.

340
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,990
Whoa.

341
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,010
Her name is Juju.

342
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,380
My dad bought it for me
on his business trip to France,

343
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,800
so I named her Juju.

344
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,050
She's five years old.

345
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,340
Dad bought this on his business trip to Finland.

346
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,840
The country where Santa and Rudolph live. You know, right?

347
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,410
Huh? Yeah.

348
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,210
Whoa.

349
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,400
That's called a music box.

350
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,610
- You like it?
- Yeah.

351
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,390
You can have that. I'll give it to you as a gift.

352
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,540
- Really?
- Yeah.

353
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,640
 She said to keep it. 

354
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,770
 I hide every last candy
in case Yeong Mi asks for it. 

355
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,930
 She gave Yeong Mi something so expensive 

356
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,020
 with a pretty smile like a princess. 

357
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,520
Solve these until our next lesson

358
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,000
and mark the ones you can't.

359
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,190
Okay.

360
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,590
Don't mark them without
trying to solve them first.

361
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,790
I can tell.

362
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,270
Oh.

363
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,100
Okay.

364
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,350
Is something wrong?

365
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,130
Why are you so listless?

366
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,190
You're not focused, either.

367
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,220
Was I ever motivated to study?

368
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,240
Excuse me.

369
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,950
Have you ever been kicked to the curb?

370
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,830
If that's what you call being rejected
after confessing your feelings,

371
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,340
then I haven't. Not at all.

372
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,640
Do you know how full of yourself
you sound right now?

373
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,500
I do.

374
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,260
What in the world do girls look for in a guy?

375
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,250
Do they have to be smart like you?

376
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,320
A bit intelligent and wears shirts like that?

377
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,190
Who is it?

378
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,620
It's not about me.

379
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,540
I'm just asking out of curiosity.
Please leave if we're done.

380
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,980
Your siblings are waiting.
I-I need to go to the gym, too.

381
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,660
 

382
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,120
Hey, Han Jae Pil!

383
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
You're here.

384
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,380
Sunbaenim, hello.

385
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,440
- You're here?
- Yes.

386
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,140
I have information that will catch your attention.

387
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,550
Guess who I saw on the way to my mom's market?

388
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,110
Who did you see?

389
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,380
Should I tell him or not? Should I or not?

390
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,860
Tell him or not? Tell him or not?

391
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,720
Don't. I'm not curious. Don't.

392
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,910
Hey, you'll regret it.

393
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,650
I saw Seo Jong Hui, you punk.

394
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,570
Who's that?

395
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,630
Do I know her? I've never heard that name before.

396
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,220
Is that manly pride or something?

397
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,490
She went into Vivaldi Music Cafe,
where we had our meeting.

398
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,990
Since she was alone,
it seemed like she was a regular.

399
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,910
Hey, shouldn't you at least give it
another shot before you give up?

400
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,780
No? You give up? Completely give up?

401
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,440
Pogi kimchi?*
(Sounds like give up)

402
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,960
This looks dusty. Hey, hold this.

403
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,710
I'll go change.

404
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,030
Give up? Completely give up? Give up?

405
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,060
Give- All right!

406
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,580
 

407
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,720
 

408
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:17,390
 

409
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,820
Geez...

410
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,430
It held on for so long, but in the end...

411
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,440
Geez, what do I do?

412
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,620
What the hell?

413
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,170
What about you?

414
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,050
I'll just...

415
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,450
walk like this.

416
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,890
Then, just give me that.

417
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,070
My slipper is the one that ripped.

418
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,750
Just wear it.

419
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,830
You came out to go to the supermarket.

420
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,220
I just have to go inside like this.

421
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,460
Oh, forget it! You'll look bad.

422
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,730
You have to save face.

423
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,540
Shit. Crazy bitch.

424
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,250
I'm sorry, Unni.

425
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,580
I must've lost my mind for a second.

426
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,750
No. I'm... I'm sorrier.

427
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,290
I even yanked your hair when you barely have any.

428
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,710
Without you, I have no one to play with or talk to.

429
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,210
You can have Mr. Kim.

430
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,020
No! You can have him. You suit him better.

431
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,420
No, I'll back off. You have him.

432
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,110
No! You can have him.

433
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,370
No, I'll back off. You can have Mr. Kim.

434
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,760
Unni!

435
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,190
- You can have him.
- You have him.

436
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,880
 Unni, you look better with him. 

437
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,840
Covering for someone is not easy.

438
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,460
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

439
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,710
Two bodies aren't enough for this.

440
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,560
Whoa.

441
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,190
Are you covering for Ms. Ko today, Ms. Choi?

442
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,660
- Yes.
- No wonder.

443
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,020
I had a good dream last night.

444
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,140
By the way, Ms. Choi.

445
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,620
Looking closely, your eyes look so pure.

446
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,300
They glisten like the night ocean
reflecting moonlight.

447
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,780
Ms. Choi, do you know yoon seul?

448
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,340
He's giving a damn speech.

449
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,140
Why the hell are you buttering up your voice?

450
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,800
Let's hurry up and get going.

451
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm really busy today.

452
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,350
All right.

453
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,840
Yeah. We should get going.

454
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,680
Get in.

455
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,010
What's with the car? Didn't you ride a motorcycle?

456
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,050
My mom's car. Her trash. My treasure.

457
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,510
By the way, how's your mother?

458
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,970
I should pay her a visit.

459
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,620
Forget it. It's a 6-person room,
so there's barely any space.

460
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,070
The hospital bill is covered?

461
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,080
I told my student's family my situation

462
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,040
and they gave me a three-month advance.

463
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,170
That's good.

464
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,000
Are you going to the hospital then?

465
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,040
No. I slept at the hospital last night,
so it's Yeong Rye's turn today.

466
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,300
I need to go home to look after the kids.

467
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,040
Is that so?

468
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,850
- Get off.
- Huh?

469
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,870
Take the bus home. I have somewhere to be.

470
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,570
Get off.

471
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,590
That's right.

472
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,290
What the hell? Telling me to get in and get off.

473
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,960
He's such a character.

474
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,810
Catch.

475
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,290
Hey, don't jump on me. Run, run, run.

476
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,010
- Get him!
- What will you do with me?

477
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,490
Aigoo. Looking at all those little ones

478
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,970
reminds me of the little ones back home.

479
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,940
I miss my younger siblings.

480
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,870
Who's the best kicker?

481
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,460
 - Him! 
- Give it a shot.

482
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,450
That won't do. Look.

483
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,650
It's going to stay up in the air.

484
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,070
One more time.

485
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,970
- Show us one more time.
- One more time?

486
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,840
- One more time.
- Please.

487
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,190
Play amongst yourselves.

488
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,620
You're good. Joon Wu's good, too.

489
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,630
They remind me of my siblings back home.

490
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,020
They're about their age.

491
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,180
You're also a big brother? The firstborn son?

492
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,980
Yeah.

493
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,090
I'm also the firstborn daughter.

494
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,940
You, too?

495
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,440
Whoa, it's the fogging truck*!
(Pest control vehicle)

496
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:01,910
Oh. T-Thanks a bunch.

497
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,300
What is this? Did you get hurt while working?

498
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,410
No, I didn't.

499
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,960
Stay put!

500
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,900
Why waste good medicine?

501
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,820
Are you going to-

502
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,420
Hey.

503
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,230
Why does a young girl's hand look like the
hand of a housewife of several years?

504
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,780
Give me your hand. Here.

505
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,920
- Why would you...
- Oh, my.

506
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,430
Since when did you care about my hands?

507
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,120
W-Wait...

508
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,050
- Hey, Ugly.
- You came.

509
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,350
Mom's over there.

510
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,240
Mother, I'm here.

511
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,500
Hello. Hello. Hello...

512
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,250
My goodness.

513
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,510
- How are you feeling?
- I'm hanging in there.

514
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,320
But I don't know what's gotten into her these days.

515
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,030
Is she hitting adolescence late?

516
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,770
Ugly! Aren't you cold?

517
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,970
What are you doing here?

518
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,940
Is something wrong?

519
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,650
No.

520
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,200
I'm just here.

521
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,270
I...

522
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,550
don't like myself.

523
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,470
Why don't you?

524
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,620
You're nice and good at your job.

525
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,370
You take good care of your siblings
and treat your mother well.

526
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,100
There's not a single thing to dislike
about you from what I see.

527
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,880
Except your face.

528
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,350
Ugly.

529
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,340
If you read the Statutes of the Republic of Korea,

530
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,960
there's an article in the first chapter.

531
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,360
"All citizens shall have the
right to pursue happiness."

532
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:15,530
But that article isn't a promise made by the
nation to ensure the citizen's happiness.

533
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,270
Then?

534
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,180
Happiness is subjective.

535
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,980
However we define happiness,

536
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,320
they'll help us in our pursuit of happiness.

537
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,700
And that's why it's not "Happiness,"
but "The pursuit of happiness."

538
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,610
What I'm saying is

539
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:42,690
that happiness is something you
have to pursue yourself.

540
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,090
If there's something you want to do, do it.

541
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:50,900
If there's something you want,
then do your best to attain it.

542
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,710
With courage.

543
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,210
 

544
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,120
I don't know what's making you dislike yourself.

545
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,430
But what are you pursuing-

546
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,810
- Oppa.
- Yeah.

547
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,020
I...

548
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,400
I have to go somewhere.

549
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,350
Thanks for the talk.

550
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,050
Hey, wait. Ugly. Ko Yeong Rye!

551
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,020
Gosh. The genre sounds like a romance.

552
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,590
Did I give unnecessary advice?

553
00:38:49,100 --> 00:39:01,500
♫  Why do birds suddenly
appear every time you are near?  ♫

554
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:11,000
♫  Just like me, they long to be close to you  ♫

555
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:23,260
♫  Why do stars fall down from the
sky every time you walk by?  ♫

556
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,590
♫  Just like me, they long to be close to you  ♫

557
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,780
 ♫ close to you ♫ 

558
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:39,380
 ♫ On the day that you were born,
the angels got together ♫ 

559
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,280
 ♫ And decided to create a dream come true ♫ 

560
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,570
 ♫ So they sprinkled moondust in your hair ♫ 

561
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:53,240
 ♫ Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue ♫ 

562
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,960
 ♫ That is why all the girls in town ♫ 

563
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,020
 Hello? 

564
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,970
 Hello? 

565
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,800
By...

566
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,440
By any chance, is Han Jae Pil there?

567
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,330
 Jae Pil? He hasn't come home from school yet. 

568
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,150
 He has seventh period today. 

569
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,200
 But who are- 

570
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,570
All right.

571
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,320
What is Ijo Jeollang?

572
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,960
The faction supporting Sim Ui Gyeom

573
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,290
in the dispute over the Ijo Jeollang
position was classified as the Seoin.

574
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,960
Let's continue with the factional
politics of Joseon next time.

575
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,700
End of class!

576
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,910
Thank you!

577
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,260
Hey, isn't history a drag?

578
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,830
I was so sleepy-

579
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,300
Hey, wait. Jae Pil, where are you going?

580
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,140
We haven't been dismissed yet.

581
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,650
 

582
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,220
Sir.

583
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,790
Your Vienna coffee is ready.

584
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,710
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

585
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,440
Ko Yeong Rye?

586
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,000
Hey, what are you doing here?

587
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,930
Oh, a-are you by yourself?

588
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,080
Where's Han Jae Pil?

589
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,590
Oh, Jae Pil?

590
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,080
He ran like the wind as soon as our class ended.

591
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Maybe something urgent came up.

592
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,210
What brings you here?

593
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,630
Are you here to see me?

594
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,210
No...

595
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,350
- Be careful.
- Y-Yeah.

596
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,220
T-Thanks.

597
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,210
You're my lifesaver.

598
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,430
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

599
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,880
Hey.

600
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,500
What are you doing here?

601
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,790
I'm a regular here.

602
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,140
A-After the meeting.

603
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,880
I come to clear my head sometimes.

604
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,950
Really? How unexpected.

605
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,150
All right. This is on the house.

606
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,730
I hope you become a regular.

607
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,060
Since we're not strangers,
we can sit together, right?

608
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,560
Sure.

609
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,110
By all means.

610
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,950
 

611
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,840
 ♫ I accidentally ran into you ♫ 

612
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,770
 ♫ I lost my heart to you ♫ 

613
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,770
 ♫ When we made eye contact ♫ 

614
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,440
 ♫ You captured my heart ♫ 

615
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,840
 ♫ I have something to tell you ♫ 

616
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,910
 ♫ But why do I lack the courage? ♫ 

617
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,970
You like this song, huh?

618
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,370
I like it, too.

619
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,080
Yeah.

620
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,950
Yeong Rye likes it, so I listened to it.
And it grew on me.

621
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,760
This song is popular these days.

622
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,400
You're right.

623
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,360
Those brothers are truly amazing.

624
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,480
They passed the preliminary round
of the University Song Festival

625
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,050
but were disqualified because they were graduates.

626
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,100
But eventually, they became this famous.

627
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,200
That's Sanulrim. This group is Songgolmae.

628
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,650
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

629
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,570
I got confused.

630
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,640
But the vocalist is amazing. Bae Cheol Soo. Right?

631
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,390
The vocalist is Koo Chang Mo.

632
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,710
Bae Cheol Soo is the guitarist.

633
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,200
You don't listen to a lot of pop music, do you?

634
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,520
- It's not your taste, is it?
- N-No.

635
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,390
I-I do like it.

636
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,750
I keep getting confused today.

637
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,310
Yeah?

638
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,110
Then, enjoy the music.

639
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,100
I have things to do.

640
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,440
Oh, you're leaving?

641
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,730
Yeah.

642
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,880
You handle the check.

643
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,210
The check-

644
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,040
Wait! Wait.

645
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,870
Eat with me.

646
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,220
Eat?

647
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,340
Well...

648
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,270
today's my birthday.

649
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,560
I don't want to eat alone.

650
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,550
Please eat with me.

651
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,030
Oh, dig in, my lifesaver.

652
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,770
Since you saved me,

653
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,350
you have to take care of me
for the rest of my life.

654
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,300
Hey, hey. That was a joke.

655
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,580
Why are you so shocked?

656
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,190
Thanks.

657
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:50,410
You must come here often with Jae Pil.

658
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,210
Oh, this place?

659
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:58,030
Sure. You could say this place pretty
much takes care of our meals.

660
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,620
Does Jae Pil like bunsik?

661
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,640
Yeah, he loves it.

662
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,640
But he can't handle spicy food.

663
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,880
One dip of this and he'll probably
drink three cups of water.

664
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,010
Quite unexpected, right?

665
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,720
And? What else does he like?

666
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,120
- Who? Me?
- No. Jae Pil.

667
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,860
Oh, Jae Pil?

668
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,340
Oh, Jae Pil...

669
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,700
Jae Pil...

670
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,580
He mainly listens to rock music.

671
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,420
And he's also good at basketball.

672
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,010
You could say he was born with athletic talent.

673
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,390
And I heard his IQ is quite high,

674
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,070
but I haven't personally confirmed that.

675
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,620
But...

676
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,240
aren't you curious about me?

677
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,050
Oh, you?

678
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,900
Do you have siblings?

679
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,230
- You were curious about that?
- Yeah.

680
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,350
I'm an only son,

681
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,460
but my father is the youngest of four siblings.

682
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,640
So, we don't have to worry about
ancestral rites or anything like that.

683
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,440
And in our household,
the woman doesn't lift a finger.

684
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,080
The men do everything.

685
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,280
Whoa, that looks good.

686
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,390
I should come here with Yeong Rye.

687
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,840
You two must be very close.

688
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
You keep talking about her.

689
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,270
What about me? Well...

690
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:27,300
Is there anything you want to know?

691
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,700
About you?

692
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,770
Not sure.

693
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,830
Are you a regular here?

694
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:38,080
Oh, I guess.

695
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,930
This? Try the corn.

696
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,740
I used to come often with my mom.

697
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,510
But it's been a while. Let's eat.

698
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,410
Sure, let's eat.

699
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,590
Eat.

700
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,700
How come you haven't been here in a while?

701
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,840
Is your mom sick of this place?

702
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,480
No.

703
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,580
She passed away.

704
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,870
- Are you all right?
- Oh, sorry.

705
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,570
No. It's fine.

706
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,940
- I got it.
- Hey, your clothes.

707
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,480
Are you all right?

708
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,890
Yeah.

709
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,400
All good.

710
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,520
Let's finish and go.

711
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,980
Huh? Where?

712
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,040
We need to go somewhere together.

713
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,760
 

714
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,010
 

715
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,430
Why are we here?

716
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:47,730
You said it's your birthday.

717
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,410
You even bought me donkatsu.
I have a conscience, you know.

718
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,330
Pick something. I'll buy you a present.

719
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,690
It's fine. I don't need a present.

720
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,790
I refuse your refusal.

721
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,130
I have money.

722
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,770
Come here.

723
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,570
What should we get?

724
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,870
Jacket? How about a jacket?

725
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,390
I like it.

726
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,000
Whoa, looks good on you.

727
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,340
Not your style?

728
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,500
No.

729
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,980
Something else?

730
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,410
How about a knit? This is nice.

731
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,720
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

732
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,200
What's with that lukewarm reaction?

733
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,420
Be considerate to the person buying you a gift.

734
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,640
Well, both of those look really nice.

735
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,390
Either will do. Quickly...

736
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,650
- Which one...
- Hey!

737
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,220
What is it?

738
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,580
What?

739
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,070
Why is the showroom display so tacky?

740
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,420
Don't you know that the display
is the lifeblood of a department store?

741
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,830
But this doesn't catch the eye.

742
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,830
Do you think I pay your salaries for this?

743
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,230
We'll rectify it, Sir.

744
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,250
Damn.

745
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:32,600
So, your dad is the department
store chairman from earlier?

746
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,810
And today isn't your birthday.

747
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,850
Had I known sooner, I should've
received a gift instead of buying you one.

748
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,690
One thing is for certain.

749
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,580
Among the people I know, you're...

750
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,250
the son of the richest family.

751
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,300
Rich... Yeah.

752
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,620
Rich is right,

753
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,270
but my father's the rich one. Not me.

754
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,810
Won't you inherit it all in the end?

755
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:29,400
But why did you try so hard to hide?

756
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,200
Does your father beat the hell out
of you if you run into him?

757
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,170
Wow.

758
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:44,820
A department store chairman beats his son up, too?

759
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,870
Well, that's news.

760
00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:00,850
He was always hot-headed,
but never to the point of being violent.

761
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,360
But ever since my mom passed away,

762
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,850
his ability to control his emotions...

763
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,350
Well, you know. It's a cliché
kind of story. Predictable.

764
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,870
I'm used to it now, so I'm okay.

765
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:25,760
But I was with you earlier.

766
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,950
That's why I was a bit...

767
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,310
You're not okay, though.

768
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,050
No need to act tough.

769
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,730
If you keep pretending to be okay,
you'll collapse all at once later.

770
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,330
When you're hurting, it's better to say so.

771
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,920
How do you know so well?

772
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,860
I was like that, too.

773
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:13,420
I acted tough and fell apart all at once.

774
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,230
Keep in touch.

775
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,370
Let's go to the library or
something on the weekend.

776
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,640
You already gave me your number and got rejected.

777
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,150
I know.

778
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:06,460
I got rejected once, so the second
time will be less shocking.

779
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,650
I...

780
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,800
I...

781
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,830
want to see you.

782
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,150
 

783
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,810
Gosh, thank you.

784
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,460
I hope the money wasn't short.

785
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,030
It's fine.

786
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,460
- Thank you.
- Good night.

787
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,970
Thank you.

788
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,600
- Geez!
- Oh, my gosh!

789
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,260
Are your eyes for show? Don't you see this?

790
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,180
You scared me. You weren't asleep?

791
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,330
T-That...

792
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,560
Apply the damn thing to your hands
after washing them.

793
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,250
Kids these days call it hand cream or whatever.

794
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:16,390
You bought this for me, Mom?

795
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:20,150
Of course, I bought it. Damn.
You think it fell from the sky?

796
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,600
Now is better than gold.

797
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,400
You have to apply it while you're still young.

798
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,490
Otherwise, your hands will
become wrinkly like mine.

799
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,730
You never buy me these things.

800
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,630
It smells nice.

801
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,960
Aigoo. Just slather it on.

802
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,040
- I'll buy you more if you run out.
- It's a waste!

803
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,720
It's not a waste. I'll buy you more.

804
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,330
It's soft.

805
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,300
- You happy?
- Yeah.

806
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,820
- Put some on your hands, too.
- Forget it!

807
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,610
- Come here.
- I'm old, anyway.

808
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,570
Yeong Mi.

809
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,650
Yeah?

810
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:16,760
Do you think my face looks paler?

811
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,030
No, it looks the same. Like a sweet potato.

812
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,250
- Oppa.
- Yeah?

813
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,690
That omurice was delicious, right?

814
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,200
It was yellow and really soft.

815
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,450
It was delicious.

816
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,000
There was meat in it, too.

817
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,020
There was.

818
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,540
Don't you want to eat it again?

819
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,230
I do.

820
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,180
Se Ri said we could come over again.

821
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,950
Oh, my! What brings you two here again?

822
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

823
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,760
Se Ri said to come over again.

824
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,490
I see.

825
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,040
And that is...

826
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:05,580
Mom said we shouldn't go to
people's houses empty-handed.

827
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,490
- Here you go.
- Oh, sure.

828
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,930
Gosh.

829
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,840
Take your shoes off and go in.

830
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,260
Yeong Bae! Yeong Mi!

831
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,770
Unni!

832
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,100
Hi.

833
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:23,400
Whoa. It's the pumpkin from Cinderella!

834
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,810
You said you saw her, you bastard.

835
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,640
When and where did you see her?

836
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,930
I saw her at Yeonpung Intersection,

837
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,300
but I was so wasted, too.

838
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,020
- I couldn't see the bus number.
- You bastard.

839
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,940
I was unsure because of the attendant's uniform,

840
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:50,030
but it was your sister for sure!

841
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,190
Attendant uniform?

842
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,730
That bitch is a bus attendant?

843
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,500
Try to run all you want.

844
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,070
- Hey!
- Unni!

845
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,340
Hey!

846
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,660
It feels like it's been ages
when it's only been a few days.

847
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,110
I almost forgot your face!

848
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,710
Have you been well?

849
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,400
I gave you all a tough time, didn't I?

850
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,400
Hey, Ko Yeong Rye.

851
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,420
It's been a while.

852
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,090
Cheers!

853
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,700
Wait, I got you.

854
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:58,330
Here. Go ahead.

855
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,280
One would think you're the patient.

856
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,340
You lost even more weight.

857
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,390
I did try to eat properly.

858
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,120
Have more after you're done. I'll make more.

859
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,530
Here. This is for dessert.

860
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,170
Thank you.

861
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,170
I met that guy yesterday. Han Jae Pil.

862
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,910
He must've found out I'm a regular at Vivaldi.

863
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,990
He was waiting there.

864
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,040
He said it was his birthday, so we ate together

865
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,610
and we went to the department
store to get him a gift.

866
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,860
You know Dongin Department Store?

867
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,090
He's the son of that family.

868
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,790
He saw his father and hid.

869
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,970
His father must be a bit violent.

870
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,080
And his mom passed away.

871
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,350
I realized being rich doesn't make you happy.

872
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,800
He gave me his number again.

873
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,400
To go to the library together this weekend.

874
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,360
And?

875
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,480
How do you feel?

876
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,180
Huh?

877
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:27,700
You're still not interested in him?

878
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,280
At all?

879
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,500
I'm not sure.

880
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,500
It's strange.

881
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,110
He seems very well off.

882
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:45,280
But at the same time, he seems
deprived and lonely, too.

883
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,790
He has been on my mind. Oddly.

884
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,060
Then, why don't you try seeing him?

885
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,820
A guy who asked me out to the library?

886
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,070
No, I don't want to.

887
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:15,160
He doesn't know me that well

888
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,510
and I can't be honest with him.

889
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,680
I don't like those two facts.

890
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:33,330
Don't you think it's because
you developed feelings for him?

891
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:36,500
Or you wouldn't even be upset.

892
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,290
Is that it?

893
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,890
I don't know my own feelings, either.

894
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:53,700
But one thing for sure

895
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,060
is that we should meet again.

896
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:00,030
I should be honest with him for starters.

897
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:03,480
That I'm an attendant and not a day student.

898
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,730
I'll think about what happens after that later.

899
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:11,410
In the end, it's either we date
or we don't, right?

900
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,290
But I have a full bus schedule that day.

901
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:23,170
I guess I didn't have time anyway.

902
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,190
I'll cover you.

903
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:42,220
You filled in for me, too.

904
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

905
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,580
You'd do that for me?

906
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:48,960
Yeah.

907
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,420
Okay.

908
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,120
Then...

909
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,560
I'll give him a call right now.

910
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,830
- Finish up and start cleaning.
- Okay.

911
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,200
 Yes, hello? 

912
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,960
 Hello? 

913
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,230
Hello?

914
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,730
You should speak if you called.

915
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:00,760
Who are you? Who are you, you punk?

916
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,670
You little brat. How dare you prank call me?

917
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,360
Who the hell are you?

918
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,920
That little...

919
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,800
Kids like that should be picked up
and thrown into jail.

920
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,230
Our nation's legal system is too weak.

921
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,530
Hello?

922
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,780
Hey.

923
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:41,460
It's me, Seo Jong Hui.

924
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,540
Yeah. Huh?

925
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:47,500
I'm using a public phone,
and I only have 10 won left.

926
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,490
I'll get straight to the point, so listen up.

927
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,520
Okay.

928
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,170
 Meet me in front of Vivaldi on Sunday at 1 p.m. 

929
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:56,850
I need to tell you something first.

930
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,940
Not over the phone.

931
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,470
 Yes. 

932
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:09,210
 It was bound to end up this way anyway. 

933
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,370
 Your one encounter was
a stronger and more powerful fate 

934
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:18,330
 than my three fateful meetings. 

935
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:27,940
 That's why I think I'll retract my right
to pursue happiness. 

936
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,660
 Because... 

937
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:42,430
 you have the right to pursue
your happiness as well. 

938
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:44,620
 And... 

939
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:49,510
 the person I wish happiness for after myself, 

940
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,970
 is you. 

941
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,220
Here.

942
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,050
Oh, that's good.

943
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,750
Why the pumpkin porridge?

944
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,890
The tutor's younger siblings brought it.

945
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,160
- Siblings?
- Yeah.

946
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,960
His brother is around Se Ri's age

947
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,420
and the girl is a year or two younger.

948
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,590
Mr. Ko must be the eldest son.

949
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:50,480
His father passed away early-

950
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,300
There you go again.

951
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,930
Why are you so interested in
other people's family matters?

952
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:57,730
Not exactly that... Se Ri, come here.

953
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,980
- Se Ri, sit down.
- Sit.

954
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:02,030
- Have some porridge.
- Good girl.

955
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,360
It's hot, so make sure to cool it down.

956
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,740
Okay!

957
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,810
Is it good?

958
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,920
- By the way, Mom.
- Yeah.

959
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,390
Where's my Cinderella pumpkin?

960
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:21,600
I left it there, but it disappeared.

961
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,110
I want to leave it in my room.

962
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:26,680
That? I made porridge with it.

963
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,330
You just had a spoonful.

964
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,860
- Give me one more bowl.
- Okay.

965
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,590
Give me my Cinderella pumpkin! Why did you eat it?

966
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,040
- I'm leaving.
- I have to turn it into a carriage!

967
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,460
Have some porridge!

968
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,700
It's Saturday, so there's no lunch.

969
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,990
- It's fine. I'm off.
- My Cinderella pumpkin!

970
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,380
You're done already?

971
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,820
That was fast.

972
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:05,170
Yeah. Maybe because it's Saturday.
It's a bit quiet.

973
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,580
What?

974
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,850
No reason. You're just pretty.

975
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,980
Right, I'm the beauty at Cheongah Transportation.

976
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,290
You really are pretty. Even now.

977
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:37,260
So, you'll tell him tomorrow, right?

978
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,990
I should.

979
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,960
I'm off!

980
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:54,610
Jong Hui! Jong Hui!

981
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:58,850
Seo Jong Hui! She left her beret behind.

982
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,800
If an inspector from HQ catches her,

983
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,060
she'll get in trouble for improper uniform.

984
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,210
- Give it to me. I'll run after her.
- What?

985
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:10,930
How are you going to catch
a bus that's already left?

986
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,760
Are you all right? Is anyone hurt?

987
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,010
Aigoo. I'm sorry.

988
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:49,180
The tire suddenly got a flat.

989
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:53,110
I think you'll have to get off
and take the next bus.

990
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:55,200
Sorry!

991
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,320
Please get off.

992
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,540
We're sorry.

993
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,010
Please get off. Sorry.

994
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:01,080
Geez.

995
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,420
That was a close one.

996
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,770
We're sorry.

997
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,550
Sorry.

998
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:09,490
Sorry.

999
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,150
Gosh. It's cleaning duty again if I'm late.

1000
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:38,540
Will it be faster to get on the next one

1001
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,920
and make a transfer?

1002
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:34,150
 ♫ When darkness falls in my quiet heart ♫ 

1003
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:40,750
 ♫ Outside is filled with so many stars ♫ 

1004
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,200
 ♫ You, who loved purple ♫ 

1005
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,130
 Weren't you going to meet and tell him, anyway? 

1006
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:51,340
 Yeah. But telling him myself and getting
caught are two different things. 

1007
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,550
 It doesn't matter to me. 

1008
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,040
 It matters to me. Don't come back here. 

1009
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,430
 Let me ask you something. 

1010
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,620
 Is there an attendant
by the name of Seo Jong Yeon? 

1011
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:02,380
 Some strange guy was looking for Seo Jong Yeon. 

1012
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:03,970
 What's going on, Jong Hui? 

1013
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:07,140
 - I have to run away. As soon as possible!
- Stop! 

1014
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,080
 Can't you just leave me alone? 

1015
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,280
 I'm utterly humiliated because
my lowest has been exposed. 

1016
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,350
 Let go. Let go! 

1017
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:15,850
 Let me stay by your side even as a friend. 

1018
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:20,280
♫  Searching for my love  ♫
