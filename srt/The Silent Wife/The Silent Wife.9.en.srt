(What Secretary Lives with the Boss?)

3
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,280
Why did you ask me out three years ago

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
before the car accident happened?

5
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,359
(Sir.)

6
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,960
(I want a big bouquet of baby's breath.)

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,159
(Here are two whistles.)

8
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,280
(The one with Y is yours.)

9
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,600
(The one with Q is mine.)

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,200
(Here, let me put it on you.)

11
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,560
(See you later.)

12
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
(I have something important
to tell you.)

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,719
(No.)

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,959
(No way.)

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
(Chiyan.)

16
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:10,680
(I won't let you remember
anything about Song Qinian.)

17
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,480
(So Shen Chiyan comes here
every day to see her.)

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,920
(Is this for me?)

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
No matter where I am,

20
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,719
as long as you blow this whistle,

21
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,599
I'll show up by your side.

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,280
(Chiyan.)

23
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,799
(You shall not remember anything.)

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Chiyan.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,000
Are you okay?

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm fine.

27
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,159
Qiutong.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,799
You just woke up.

29
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,359
You need to rest plenty.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,519
Let's talk once you're better, okay?

31
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,879
Chiyan.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,719
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,240
I meant to give you my blessing.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,719
But I couldn't do it.

35
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,560
If I knew you had married Song Qinian,

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
I would rather stay in a coma forever.

37
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,280
Because I was the one who saved you.

38
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,400
Of course, I know that.

39
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,280
She may be my wife,

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,199
but I only see her

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,039
as a secretary.

42
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,879
Actually, Song Qinian

43
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,520
has helped us a lot over the years.

44
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,800
Song Guanliang also paid for his sin.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,719
Besides,

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,560
only Song Qinian has a blood type
that matches yours.

47
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,360
That's why I kept her by my side.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
I kept her around

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
just to give blood to you.

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,599
Since she's just a secretary,

51
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,879
can I ask her to take care of me

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,240
during my recovery?

53
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,680
Of course.

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
As long as you want,

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have no objections.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Chiyan.

57
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,000
You are so sweet.

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Mr. Shen, please talk to Mrs. Shen.

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,120
She insists on leaving.

60
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,400
Leave us alone.

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,639
Why are you leaving?

62
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,959
(Lin Qiutong has woken up.)

63
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,720
(You no longer need me.)

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,639
You're so eager to sever ties with me?

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
(What tie?)

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,399
(What kind of tie is there?)

67
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Don't forget.

68
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,000
You are still my secretary.

69
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,560
(What secretary lives with the boss?)

70
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,759
Come here.

71
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,399
(What do you want?)

72
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,360
(What makes you think you can leave me?)

73
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,000
(Stay still.)

74
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,000
(Even if I can't control myself,)

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,519
(I can control you.)

76
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,879
(Shen Chiyan, be rational.)

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
(Song Qinian.)

78
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,079
(You made me lose control.)

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,879
(You're lying to yourself.)

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,399
(Clearly, you have feelings for me.)

81
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,800
(Why won't you admit it?)

82
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,199
(This time,)

83
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,800
(let me completely lose my sanity)

84
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,319
(for you.)

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,279
(Song Qinian.)

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,360
(You are my wife.)

87
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,439
(I've never)

88
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,879
(ever thought of leaving you.)

89
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,399
Good morning, Mr. Shen.

90
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,600
Make an extra breakfast

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,639
and take it to Qiutong.

92
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,720
Qiu...?

93
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
Miss Qiutong?

94
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,399
Okay, I'll make another breakfast.

95
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,439
Okay.

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
(I'll do it.)

97
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,879
(I'll make breakfast and take it there.)

98
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,759
(This is an opportunity.)

99
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,160
(I can ask Lin Qiutong)

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,399
(and figure out
if my dad really kidnapped her.)

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,240
Qiutong, come on.

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,519
Qiutong.

103
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,639
I've been applying

104
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,680
face masks and essences
for you every day.

105
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,199
To maintain your fair skin,

106
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,439
I have really tried my best

107
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,480
and exhausted myself in devotion.

108
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,000
Fine, I know you love me the most.

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,360
Song Qinian?

110
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,639
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,680
Lanxing.

112
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,879
Chiyan sent Miss Song here
to bring me breakfast.

113
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,759
Song Qinian, I'm warning you.

114
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,079
We're in a hospital.

115
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,879
You'd better watch it.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,199
Otherwise, Chiyan and I
won't let you off.

117
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,000
I told Chiyan that

118
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,560
Lanxing could take care of me,

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,160
but he couldn't feel at ease.

120
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,560
It's one thing
to send flowers every day.

121
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,639
But why does he ask you
to bring food in person?

122
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,600
Qiutong.

123
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,639
That's because Chiyan loves you.

124
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,839
But Qiutong.

125
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,199
Don't you feel disgusted to eat

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,240
what she brings you?

127
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,160
Miss Song.

128
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,439
Sit with me a bit.

129
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,199
(If she has been in a coma)

130
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,199
(because my dad kidnapped her,)

131
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,000
(shouldn't she hate me to her guts?)

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,399
Actually, I've been thinking a lot.

133
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,360
Your dad did this to me.

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,839
But you are innocent.

135
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,399
I can't transfer my hatred for your dad

136
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,959
onto you.

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,639
(So what if you're married to Chiyan?)

138
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,839
(You're just a mute.
I'm the one who's going to win.)

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,399
Right.

140
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,040
I heard that
you made this meal in person.

141
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,879
So I must try it.

142
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,559
Lanxing.

143
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,080
It looks really good.

144
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,639
I'm actually hungry.

145
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,200
It's just a little bland.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
It's missing something.

147
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,120
Mmm.

148
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,759
