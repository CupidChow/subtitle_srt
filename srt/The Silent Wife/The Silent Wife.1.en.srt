(You Don't Deserve to Bear My Child)

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,359
(Chiyan.)

4
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,640
(That accident cost your memory.)

5
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,079
(You forgot our past.)

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,159
(Qiutong tried to save you.)

7
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,000
Chiyan, be careful.

8
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,960
(And fell into a coma.)

9
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,879
(As long as you need it,)

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,439
(I can sustain her with my blood)

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
(until she wakes up.)

12
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,319
(For three years,)

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,879
(you've been taking me around)

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,519
(as your secretary,
hiding the fact that we're married.)

15
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,599
(I don't blame you.)

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,799
(You've lost your memory.)

17
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,159
(It's okay.)

18
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,719
(I will make you remember me.)

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,439
Trying to seduce me
when I'm drunk again?

20
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,040
Three years ago,

21
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,480
you and your mom forced me to marry you

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,879
with such despicable means.

23
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,359
You're playing the same tricks again?

24
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,640
Speak.

25
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,640
Oh.

26
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,159
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,280
I forgot

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
you are mute.

29
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,840
(No, Chiyan.)

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,879
(Let me explain.)

31
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,960
(I made hangover soup for you.)

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
Song Qinian.

33
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,000
I've told you long ago

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,879
that I will never fall in love
with a wicked woman like you.

35
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120
(If none of that had happened,)

36
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,639
(we wouldn't have ended up like this.)

37
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,400
Look at the willow catkin.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,520
It's barging lustfully

39
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,960
into the room just like you.

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,879
You wait for me
to come home every night,

41
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,159
dressed like this.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
Isn't it just for that?

43
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,120
Since you've been plotting it,

44
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,479
I'll give you what you want.

45
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,479
Untie it.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,879
Untie it.

47
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,960
(Why can't I say "no")

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,520
(when I see his face?)

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
(It's been three years,)

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,800
(and we still haven't resolved
the misunderstanding between us.)

51
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,719
(But I am willing to wait)

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,199
(for another chance.)

56

Hello.

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,959
Yeah, it's me.

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,879
What's wrong with Qiutong?

59
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,160
Okay.

60
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,600
Be right there.

61
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,560
Qiutong needs a blood transfusion.

62
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,759
Come with me.

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,959
(My dad fell ill.)

64
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,279
(He needs medical parole.)

65
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,480
(Please help me.)

66
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,000
Medical parole?

67
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,800
If Song Guanliang
hadn't kidnapped Qiutong

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,519
for money,

69
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,319
she wouldn't be bedridden
for three years.

70
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,240
Your family is in debt to her.

71
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,519
(He is wrongly accused.)

72
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,360
If you don't want your dad
to die in prison,

73
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,360
just do as I say.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,160
If anything happens to Qiutong today,

75
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll make your whole family pay.

76
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,399
It's not up to you
whether to come with me.

77
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,000
Mr. Shen.

78
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,279
This mute really has no shame.

79
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,879
(She climbed onto Mr. Shen's bed)

80
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,040
(when he was drunk.)

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
(Exactly.)

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,079
(If Miss Lin hadn't fallen into a coma,)

83
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,920
(trying to save him,)

84
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,199
(how would this woman be allowed here?)

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,519
(Just watch.)

86
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,399
(The day Miss Lin wakes up,)

87
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,120
(this woman will be ousted.)

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,079
(Chiyan, have you forgotten)

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
(all your promises to me?)

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
(No matter where I am,)

91
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,319
(as long as you blow this whistle,)

92
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,160
(I'll show up by your side.)

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,480
(I will be your voice.)

94
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,800
(How can we go back
to how things were before?)

95
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,079
Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen left her phone
in the kitchen.

96
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,720
It's been ringing. It seems urgent.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,720
Song Qinian.

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,680
What is going on right now?

99
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
It's been three years

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,480
and you still have no kids?

101
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,759
Think of something.

102
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,680
Or you might be kicked out
of the Shen family.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Remember.

104
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,680
Your only advantage is your good looks.

105
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,800
Try to conceive Shen Chiyan's child

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,160
so that he doesn't divorce you.

107
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,879
You want to have my child?

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You and your family
should give up on that.

109
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,079
To the hospital.

110
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:08,800
Hurry.

111
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,079
Mr. Shen.

112
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,199
You brought Ms. Song
for another blood transfusion?

113
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:28,920
Yeah.

114
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Miss Song.

115
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,959
Can you handle

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,839
a 300cc of blood transfusion?

117
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
It's fine.

118
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
It's not the first time.

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,959
Miss Lin is so lucky.

120
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,480
She has such a rare blood type

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,279
and Miss Song happens to have it too.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
(She is indeed lucky.)

123
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,160
(But what about me?)

124
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,639
Please go ahead.

125
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,399
Okay.

126
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,720
Miss Song.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,759
Miss Song.

128
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,120
Miss Song.

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,199
It's an emergency.

130
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,920
Only you can save Miss Lin now.

131
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,399
Qiutong.

132
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,160
How are you doing?

133
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,639
Mr. Shen.

134
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
What's wrong?

135
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,960
A message came from the prison.

136
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,000
Mrs. Shen's dad

137
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,080
developed an acute illness.

138
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,919
Dr. Chen wants to know...

139
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,480
Hush.

140
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,879
Qiutong is not doing so well.

141
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
Song Guanliang can wait.

142
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,519
I know you have concerns.

143
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,679
But the Lin family...

144
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,039
Mrs. Shen.

145
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,159
Song Qinian.

146
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,519
Calm down.

147
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,799
Don't get worked up.

148
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,399
Let's talk it out.

149
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,559
Okay, I'll stay here.

150
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
(Save my dad.)

151
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
Are you threatening me?

152
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,519
Song Qinian.

153
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,759
Take a good look at Qiutong.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,159
She could have had

155
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,879
a completely different life.

156
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,039
But your father ruined that chance.

157
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,440
Now you're threatening me
with her safety?

158
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't you have any sense of guilt?

159
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,759
Mrs. Shen.

160
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,039
Calm down.

161
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,519
(You won't believe whatever I say.)

162
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,279
(Then take my life)

163
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,279
(to compensate her.)

164
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,960
(Just let my dad live.)

165
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,320
Mrs. Shen.

166
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Song Qinian.

167
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,559
Let's talk this over.

168
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,399
(Dad, I'm exhausted.)

169
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,120
(No one in this world loves me.)

170
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,360
