(You Still Owe Me a Wedding!)

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,479
Hurry.

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,320
Chiyan, you'll be fine.

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,960
Hang in there. We're almost there.

6
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,600
Qinian.

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,799
Hurry.

8
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,920
Sorry.

9
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,400
I

10
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,560
love...

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,200
Chiyan, you still owe me a wedding.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,640
Chiyan, I forbid you to die.

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,719
Hurry, please step aside.

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,040
Chiyan.

15
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,261
(Operation)

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Qinian, rest assured.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He loves you so much.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
He will make it.

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
Mrs. Shen, please have some water.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680
The surgery will take a while.

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,959
Sit down and rest.

22
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,000
Or you may collapse

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
before Mr. Shen comes out.

24
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,599
Li Nanxun.

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
Think twice before you talk.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,359
Sorry.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,760
Qinian.

28
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,480
Qinian.

29
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,879
Grandma.

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,519
T-This is...

31
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,840
It's all my fault.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
I got Chiyan into this.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't talk nonsense.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,840
Shen Qiwen is the guilty one.

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,240
And that girl from the Lin family.

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,800
They're utterly possessed.

37
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,960
Qinian, don't cry.

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,439
Now is not the time to cry.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
At such a moment,

40
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,879
we must stay strong for our family.

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
He will be fine.

42
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,599
That little rascal

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,080
has done so many bad things to you.

44
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,960
He has to wake up

45
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,840
and repay his debts.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,039
Grandma is right.

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,280
Chiyan is definitely blessed.

48
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,800
He will be alright.

49
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,879
We brought you some porridge.

50
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,560
Have a bite.

51
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,439
It will give you some strength.

52
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,719
No need.

53
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
I have no appetite.

54
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,039
Keqin.

55
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,560
Grandma.

56
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,960
I'll go to the restroom.

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,719
These two kids have suffered too much.

58
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
(I know that no matter what I say or do)

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
(can't make up for the past.)

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,960
But please.

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,560
Give me one more chance.

62
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,879
One last chance.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,039
Let me love you once more.

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,039
(From this moment on,)

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,479
I'll be a good husband
and a good father.

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,560
Can you trust me once again?

67
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,879
(I'm sorry.)

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
I didn't make it that day

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,279
because I was in a car accident

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,759
and forgot everything about us.

71
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,879
(I even forgot you.)

72
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,439
(And I invited you)

73
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,879
(to the lighthouse)

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,240
(to confess my feelings to you.)

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,240
I like you.

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
(I have Lin Qiutong here.)

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,040
(Bring one million in cash
to this address.)

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
(Or she dies.)

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,528
(I'll kill her if you call the cops.
You have 20 minutes.)

80
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,040
Qinian. Wait for me.

81
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,040
I'll be right there.

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,920
Lin Qiutong.

83
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,000
Qiutong.

84
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,639
What's taking Qiwen so long?

85
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,439
And where is Song Guanliang?

86
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,040
He hasn't woken up, right?

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,759
No way.

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,879
I need to take a look.

89
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,000
Lin Qiutong.

90
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,959
Hello?

91
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm here.

92
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,000
Qiutong.

93
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,279
I won't let Shen Chiyan hurt you again.

94
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,279
Chiyan, look out.

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Chiyan.

96
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,560
Qiutong.

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Qiutong.

98
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,959
It's an emergency.

99
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,439
No. 798, Zhaoyun Road.

100
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
I've hit someone.

101
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,879
Come quickly.

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,480
Hurry.

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,560
What's going on?

104
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,040
Don't speak.

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,879
Don't speak.

106
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,920
Did I hit someone?

107
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Don't hurt Qinian.

108
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:35,960
Listen.

109
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,480
As long as you behave,

110
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,679
I promise she'll be fine.

111
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Get it?

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,120
Come sit here.

113
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,039
Drive.

114
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,919
Remember.

115
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,399
You hit someone with your car.

116
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,559
Make the confession

117
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,879
and your daughter will be fine.

118
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,679
Got it?

119
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,639
Got it?

120
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,480
Yeah.
