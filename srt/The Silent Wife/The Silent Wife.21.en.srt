=The Silent Wife=

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,468
=Episode 21=
(Lin Qiutong, You Are Also a Pet)

3
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,799
Mr. Shen.

4
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,840
You don't mind me
bringing my wife, do you?

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,039
Not at all.

6
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,840
Mr. Shen, glad to meet you.

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,159
I'm Song Qinian.

8
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,920
Have we met before?

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,879
Qinian.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,640
Mr. Shen just got back from abroad.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,799
How could you have met?

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
Mr. Shen, please don't mind her.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,719
It's fine.

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,400
Mr. Guan, I should congratulate you

15
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,079
for having such a beautiful wife.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,640
Waiter.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,879
Here.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,920
Is it good?

19
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,079
Mr. Guan, do you have any other concerns

20
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,200
about our cooperation?

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Not at all.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm ready to sign.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,000
I have a question.

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,719
Why me?

25
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,000
Once we sign the contract,

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,319
you'll secure your position

27
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,959
and we'll stay as partners.

28
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,599
I believe you won't

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,959
let me down on the serious matters.

30
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,480
(You're using me)

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,359
(to suppress Shen Chiyan,)

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,719
(so that he has no chance
of getting Song Qinian back.)

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,719
(Guan Mingxu.)

34
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,840
(You turn out to be quite ruthless.)

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,560
Of course.

36
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,240
Looking forward to working with you.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,560
And I wish you a happy marriage.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,639
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

39
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,479
Mr. Shen.

40
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,639
Is there something on my face?

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,759
No.

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,319
I'm just a bit jealous

43
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,000
about how sweet you two are.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,759
(Shen Chiyan.)

45
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,000
(You forgot Song Qinian
three years ago.)

46
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,479
(Now she has forgotten you)

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,719
(and ended up with Guan Mingxu.)

48
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,400
(I hope you get to see
what they're like now.)

49
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,639
Chiyan.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
You said you missed me. Did you mean it?

51
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,360
Don't you believe me?

52
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,840
I've realized that
Song Qinian doesn't love me at all.

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,879
She's been deceiving me all along.

54
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,759
Chiyan, you've finally seen the truth.

55
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,879
I'm the only one who loves you.

56
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,439
You love me so much.

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Then why are you helping Shen Qiwen?

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,039
You told your family to help Shen Qiwen

59
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,680
secure the deal, didn't you?

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,919
If I hadn't done this,

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,039
would you have come here?

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,039
I risked the entire Lin Corporation

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,960
to get Shen Qiwen to the top.

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,719
Why do you think I did that?

65
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,240
Chiyan.

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,080
I did it to win you over.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
How about this?

68
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,280
Let's have a baby.

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,759
Then I'll make Shen Qiwen
give you the company back.

70
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,439
Qiutong.

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,839
You've really lost it.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Chiyan.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,120
You're right.

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
I lost it three years ago.

75
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,240
I lost it

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,480
and risked my life to save you.

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,439
I lost it

78
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,920
and let you marry
the daughter of Song Guanliang.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,199
I lost it so that I could have you.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,040
I've loved you for 15 years.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,839
Shen Chiyan.

82
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,800
Fifteen years.

83
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm sorry, Qiutong.

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,839
Fifteen years.

86
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,600
Why have you never told me?

87
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,360
Chiyan.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,839
I could do anything for you.

89
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,079
No one in this world
could love you more than I do.

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,399
I love you too.

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
Qiutong.

92
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,600
I remember now, Mr. Shen.

93
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,120
We have met before.

94
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,040
I was out shopping with Mingxu.

95
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,519
You were with Lin Qiutong.

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,639
Do you remember?

97
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,959
You know Lin Qiutong?

98
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,040
She's my schoolmate.

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,079
She came to my house just last week

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,879
and said some weird stuff.

101
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,519
Forget it.

102
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,560
Mr. Shen, do you like Qiutong?

103
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,639
I don't think

104
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,839
we're close enough
to discuss our personal lives.

105
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,720
Mr. Shen.

106
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
Please don't be shy.

107
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,720
Mingxu told me

108
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,279
that Qiutong also likes you.

109
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,839
Since you both like each other,

110
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,680
I'll be waiting for your good news.

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,720
Thank you.

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,360
What's wrong?

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,240
Nothing.

114
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,000
Something came up.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,079
Please explain to Mr. Guan for me.

116
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,399
Sorry.

117
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
I'm late.

118
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,600
He didn't hurt you, right?

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,920
Why didn't you
give me a call beforehand?

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,040
What do you want?

121
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,639
Did you sleep with him?

122
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,000
That's none of your business.

123
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,879
Tell me. Did you sleep with him?

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,759
Shen Qiwen, you're hurting me.

125
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,519
Let me go.

126
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,519
She's hurting. Didn't you hear that?

127
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,160
Shen Qiwen.

128
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,240
I'm telling you.

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,360
Qiutong and I

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,279
are in love.

131
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,800
Whatever we decide

132
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,920
to do,

133
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,800
it's none of your business.

134
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,639
Right now, you really

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
look like a dog wagging its tail.

136
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
Qiwen.

137
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,840
Go home first.

138
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
I'll explain to you tomorrow.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,879
Explain to me?

140
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,639
You've got it wrong.

141
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
Does a master need to explain to a dog?

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
A dog only follows orders.

143
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,399
Qiwen.

144
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,440
Be good.

145
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,480
Stop making a fuss and go home.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,799
Shen Chiyan.

147
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,600
You say you are in love with Qiutong.

148
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,039
What about Song Qinian?

149
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,799
Why should I explain to you?

150
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,279
Once the divorce is finalized,

151
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,720
I will propose to Qiutong

152
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,480
and give her
what I've owed her for years.

153
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,360
Chiyan.

154
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
What's so funny?

155
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
You poor thing.

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I thought I was the most pitiful one.

157
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,679
Turns out, it's you.

158
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,919
What are you trying to say?

159
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,320
We are like characters in a fairy tale,

160
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,519
doing things based on
a predefined persona.

161
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,200
You're

162
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,799
playing your role as a noble prince.

163
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,960
And I

164
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,200
am the ludicrous knight.

165
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,639
But Qiutong.

166
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm tired.

167
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,159
I'm so tired.

168
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
I also want to be a prince.

169
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,039
I also want to be with my princess.

170
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,600
Chiyan, he's drunk.

171
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,919
I'll take him back right away.

172
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,720
Lin Qiutong.

173
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,320
You take my love for granted.

174
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,519
For so many years,

175
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,759
I've loved you without holding back.

176
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,919
I was even willing to become

177
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,159
a demon for you.

178
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
But what did you do?

179
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,840
Please think about it.

180
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,440
What have you become now?

181
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,559
You used to be so happy and smiley.

182
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,480
But ever since you fell for Shen Chiyan,

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,080
you've never smiled again.

184
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,519
Chiyan.

185
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,480
It's not like that.

186
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,840
Don't listen to him.

187
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,360
Shen Qiwen, shut up.

188
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,679
I am not the only pet in this room.

189
