(Qiutong, I Miss You So Much)

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,560
Qinian.

4
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,200
You've come back?

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,840
Yeah.

6
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:00,960
Take a seat.

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,600
Where's your grandma?

8
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,959
You've become even prettier.

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,400
Thank you.

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,079
Alright, alright.

11
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,879
Drink some water.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,799
Grandma just went out.

13
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,359
Please sit for a while.

14
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,280
Have some tea.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,159
Qinian,

16
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,000
you really can speak now?

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,319
That's great.

18
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,879
Qinian,

19
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,120
I heard you brought your husband
back too.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,439
Let's take a look.

21
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,079
Exactly.

22
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,400
Which of you two is Qinian's husband?

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,040
Me.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
He's my husband,

25
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,159
Guan Mingxu.

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,159
Hello.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,159
We watched Qinian grow up.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,840
We can't stand to see her suffer
even a bit.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,159
You got married years ago

30
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,159
but you never came back.

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,400
How could you do that?

32
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,280
You're right.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,920
I used

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,079
to be such a scoundrel.

35
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,159
I was totally a blind fool.

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,040
I didn't see how good she is.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,879
I was a scoundrel.

38
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,079
Actually, he's very good to me.

39
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,359
He always does the chores.

40
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,400
We never had a fight.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,200
That's good.

42
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,079
Qinian,

43
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,719
I'll treat you even better.

44
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,079
If anyone makes you suffer,

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
I'll make them suffer more.

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,319
That's good.

47
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,719
Hearing Mingxu say this,

48
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,599
we feel assured.

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,079
We missed your wedding.

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
Now we must make up for the gifts.

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,560
Come on.

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,960
How can we accept this?

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,159
Take it.

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,319
No need for that.

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
There are also local specialties.

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
And the gift.

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
Chiyan,

58
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,280
hurry and take them.

59
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,000
Come on, take it.

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,520
When do you plan to have children?

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
Qinian, you are truly blessed.

62
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,479
Your husband is tall and handsome

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,879
and is good to you.

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,240
Guys, let's eat.

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,360
Okay.

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,039
Come on, eat some more.

67
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,000
Stay a few more days this time.

68
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,960
After living in the city,

69
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,319
not used to the countryside, huh?

70
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,080
What's up?

71
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,039
Come visit us when you have time.

72
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Spend more time here.

73
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,400
Really nice.

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240
Okay.

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,479
I'll come back now.

76
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,560
You go ahead and chat.

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay, okay.

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,879
There's a situation.

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
I have to go back.

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,719
I can't wait for you to leave.

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,919
Take good care of Qinian.

82
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,439
I'll be back once I'm done.

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,599
Just go.

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,840
Just live your life.

85
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,639
Hey,

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
call me if there's anything.

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,599
That's great.

88
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,080
We're leaving.

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,919
I got things to do.

90
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,800
Come over another day.

91
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,400
Take care.

92
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,240
We're leaving.

93
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,520
No need to see us out.

94
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,240
See you.

95
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,400
Well,

96
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,759
where is he?

97
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,719
He said something happened

98
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,800
and left in a hurry.

99
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,840
It seemed to be

100
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
something serious.

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,240
Morning,

102
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,519
Chiyan.

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
Shen Qiwen.

104
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,000
Get out of here now.

105
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,519
This is not your seat.

106
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,600
The board oversees the group.

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
Who should be the real leader

108
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,959
is up to them.

109
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,639
During the time you were away,

110
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,160
the company fell into chaos.

111
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
I was the one
who secured three major deals.

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,879
The proposal to dismiss the president
has been passed.

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
I

114
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,360
am the new president.

115
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,279
Now, even with your shares,

116
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,319
you still can't surpass me.

117
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,600
You've lost.

118
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,720
Shen Qiwen.

119
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,720
Stop there.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,600
Don't move

121
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
You're mad now?

122
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,519
I'll give you ten minutes

123
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,800
to get out of here.

124
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,759
By the way,

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,879
you can ask Grandma

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,639
to see if she'll help you this time.

127
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,680
Be careful on the road.

128
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,879
Call me when you get home.

129
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,879
Got it, Grandma.

130
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,279
Don't worry.

131
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,839
Then I'm leaving.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Grandma,

133
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,480
I'll miss you.

134
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
Take care of yourself.

135
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,680
Wait for my return.

136
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
I'll be back on the weekend.

137
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
Well then, we're leaving.

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,360
I can handle this on my own.

139
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,319
If you want to stay here longer,

140
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,519
you can stay.

141
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,639
No.

142
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,920
I have an appointment

143
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
with someone.

144
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,000
Miss Song.

145
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,439
Over here.

146
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,199
You are?

147
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
Zhou Luote.

148
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,879
Do you need me for anything?

149
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,639
Miss Song,

150
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,920
what do you mean?

151
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
Didn't you ask me

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,839
to find Qiwen's photos
before his surgery?

153
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,079
Take a look.

154
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,199
How could I possibly ask you to do this?

155
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,040
You asked me to do it.

156
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,720
Mr. Shen looked so terrible before.

157
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,800
But why did you

158
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,000
show me this?

159
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,160
Miss Song, have you forgotten?

160
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,600
It's about a kidnapping case.

161
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
About the kidnapping three years ago,

162
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480
he was an accomplice

163
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
and the mastermind was Lin Qiutong.

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,360
Lin Qiutong?

165
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,959
The heiress of the Lin family?

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,639
How could she possibly kidnap someone?

167
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,079
And there was no kidnapping at all
three years ago.

168
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,560
Miss Song,

169
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,839
do you still remember
the cause of your dad's death?

170
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
My dad?

171
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,839
My dad had a heart condition.

172
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,399
He was always in the hospital.

173
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,600
He passed away
from a sudden heart attack.

174
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,560
Just stop the investigation.

175
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,959
Miss Song.

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Miss Song.

177
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,000
Who are you?

178
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,920
About the kidnapping
three years ago and my dad's death,

179
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,959
what do you know?

180
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,399
Tell me everything.

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm warning you one last time.

182
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,600
If you dare mess with Qinian again,

183
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,879
I can't guarantee
what will happen to your family.

184
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,080
(I don't ever want to see you again.)

185
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:32,960
Qiutong.

186
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,759
Chiyan.

187
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,639
How did you get so drunk?

188
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,159
I'm fine.

189
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,159
It was all my fault before.

190
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,679
I miss you so much.
