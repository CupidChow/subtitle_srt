00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:42,908
=The Silent Wife=

2
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:45,436
=Episode 8=
(Didn't He Confess to Song Qinian?)

3
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,560
Miss Lin, it's great
that you've woken up.

4
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,320
Mr. Shen has often visited you
over these three years.

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
He will be thrilled

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,119
to know that you're awake.

7
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,599
He often comes to see me?

8
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,519
Yeah.

9
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,120
Everyone here knows
how much he loves you.

10
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,040
So faithful and devoted.

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,519
We're all so envious.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,159
Let me tell Mr. Shen the good news.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,359
Thank you.

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,480
Can you do me a favor?

15
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,519
Don't tell Chiyan yet.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,200
I want to surprise him.

17
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,480
You're really thoughtful.

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,560
Mr. Shen will surely be thrilled.

19
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,640
Qiutong.

20
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,640
Lanxing.

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,359
Qiutong.

22
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,680
You've finally woken up.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,640
You have no idea
what we've gotten through

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,640
while you were in a coma.

25
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,040
I never thought that

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,159
I'd be in a coma for three years.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,519
And Chiyan.

28
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,199
He loves you so much.

29
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,199
How could you bear to
keep him waiting for so long?

30
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,199
Lanxing.

31
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,319
Qiutong.

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,360
What's wrong?

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,000
Qiutong.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,759
I only remember
that I had a car accident.

35
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,479
Qiutong.

36
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,879
And then I was kidnapped.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
What happened after that?

38
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,719
Qiutong.

39
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,400
Do you remember
Chiyan's confession to you?

40
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,120
(Confession to me?)

41
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,919
(Didn't he confess to Song Qinian?)

42
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,355
(Three years ago)

43
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,759
Chiyan.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,879
Lin Qiutong.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,159
Tomorrow is my birthday.

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,439
You must come.

47
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,479
Tomorrow?

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,319
I'm afraid I can't.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,039
Rest assured.

50
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,719
I'll send you a gift.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,000
You can't even make it
to my birthday party?

52
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,120
You have something important to do?

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,039
Well.

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,319
Tomorrow,

55
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,479
I'm going to
confess my feelings to Qinian.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,479
I've waited for too long.

57
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,719
Three years ago,

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Song Qinian's father
kidnapped you for ransom.

59
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,280
Then you were in a car accident
with Chiyan.

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,039
But you protected Chiyan

61
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,360
so he wasn't as badly injured as you.

62
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,479
It's just that

63
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,080
he lost part of his memory.

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,639
But rest assured.

65
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,919
He hasn't forgotten that he loves you.

66
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,800
So you're saying that

67
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,599
Chiyan has been waiting for me

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
to wake up all these years?

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,000
He hasn't been with anyone else?

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,639
He married Song Qinian.

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,199
Qiutong.

72
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,080
Don't get worked up.

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,319
He didn't want to marry her.

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
You know

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
how terrifying Madam Shen could be.

76
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,319
Chiyan didn't dare
to go against her will.

77
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,680
Besides,

78
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,719
Chiyan never considered
Song Qinian as his wife.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I've heard that

80
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,160
they've been sleeping in separate rooms.

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,279
Also,

82
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,720
Chiyan has never

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,839
acknowledged her as his wife.

84
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,839
He's only acknowledged her
as his secretary.

85
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,199
(Now that)

86
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,560
(Chiyan and everyone else believe)

87
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,480
(that I am his true love,)

88
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,000
(I might as well make the best of it.)

89
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,959
Oh, I forgot.

90
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
Chiyan told me

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,040
to notify him as soon as you woke up.

92
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,879
Lanxing.

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,399
Don't tell him yet.

94
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,639
Why not?

95
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,800
Qiutong.

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,399
Don't you want to see him sooner?

97
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,480
Are you mad

98
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,319
because he married

99
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,720
Song Qinian

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
and you don't want to see him?

101
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,040
How could I blame him?

102
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,560
I just don't want him

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,399
to see me like this.

104
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,360
Qiutong.

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,600
Chiyan loves you so much.

106
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,959
You're always the prettiest

107
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,519
in his mind no matter what.

108
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,360
Let's wait until
I've recovered a bit more.

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,720
Right, Qiutong.

110
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,720
Dad's birthday is in three days.

111
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,839
Will you come home?

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,720
Of course.

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,480
Okay, you're...

114
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,519
You're the best, Qiutong.

115
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Mom and Dad would be overjoyed.

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,199
I'll send the invitation

117
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,199
to Chiyan right now.

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait.

119
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,839
Lanxing.

120
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,920
Add Song Qinian

121
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,839
to the invitation.

122
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,639
Song Qinian?

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,360
Are you still dazed

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,759
out of the coma?

125
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,519
Why invite her?

126
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,759
What a jinx.

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,279
We should show respect to Madam Shen.

128
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,279
After all, she's married to Chiyan.

129
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,519
For now.

130
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,920
Okay.

131
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,920
Let her come.

132
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,000
I will make sure she gets humiliated

133
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
and loses face in front of everyone.

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,279
How dare she bully my sister?

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Right, Lanxing.

136
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,800
Change the white roses

137
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,240
into baby's breath.

138
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,399
Qiutong.

139
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,560
Don't you hate baby's breath?

140
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,120
It's been three years.

141
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,360
People change.

142
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,639
I've started to take an interest
in baby's breath.

143
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,199
(Inpatient Department)

144
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,839
Qiutong.

145
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,720
As long as I'm here,

146
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,160
nothing will happen to you.

147
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,160
Qiutong.

148
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,079
Is this how you treat
your so-called wife?

149
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,279
Are you a man or not?

150
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,360
Shen Chiyan.

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
I swear I'd punch you.

152
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,480
Lie here for a second.

153
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,319
Mr. Shen.

154
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,079
Miss Lin is fine now.

155
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:49,920
Okay.

156
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,600
Dr. Pei.

157
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,480
Thank you.

158
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
We'll leave you to talk.

159
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Thank you.

160
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,279
Qiutong.

161
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Chiyan.

162
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,079
I miss you so much.

163
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,720
All right, Qiutong.

164
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:11,920
Come on.

165
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,399
(Is this how you treat
your so-called wife?)

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,199
Are you a man or not?

167
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,319
(I wonder how she's doing.)

168
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,279
Chiyan.

169
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,584
Why are you looking at me like that?

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,720
Aren't you happy that I woke up?

171
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,000
Of course, I am.

172
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
We've all been
waiting for you to wake up.

173
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,480
I didn't expect that

174
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,679
I would sleep for three years.

175
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,039
Qiutong.

176
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,919
Chiyan.

178
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,759
I don't mean to blame you.

179
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,799
Right.

180
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,919
Why did you ask me out three years ago

181
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,279
before the car accident happened?

182
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,679
(Sir, I want a big bouquet
of baby's breath.)

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
(Here are two whistles.)

184
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,080
(The one with Y is yours.)

185
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
(The one engraved with Q is mine.)

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,960
(Here, let me put it on you.)

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,480
(See you later.)

188
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,919
(I have something important
to tell you.)

189
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,480
(No.)

190
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,600
