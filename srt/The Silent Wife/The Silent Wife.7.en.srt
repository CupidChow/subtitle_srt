=The Silent Wife=

2
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:45,532
=Episode 7=
(You Are My Knight)

3
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,640
You brought your wife
to be humiliated by the Lin family.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,439
Only you could do something like this.

5
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,560
Stop meddling

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,039
in the adults' affairs.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,799
You can't even protect your wife.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,159
What kind of adult are you?

9
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,840
She is only my wife in name.

10
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,519
Thankfully, Grandma knew

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,239
you'd bring my sister-in-law here.

12
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,760
So she sent me here
to protect my sister-in-law

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,599
from the Lin family.

14
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,920
Otherwise,

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,640
who knows how badly
Qinian would have been bullied?

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,519
(How come you are here?)

17
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,239
I'll go wherever you are.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,000
(What did you say?)

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,680
I'll go wherever it's fun.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,040
It was Shen Keqin.

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
She said you were here so I came over.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,120
So?

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,040
Is the party fun?

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,680
Since you're not having fun,

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,200
let me take you somewhere.

26
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,439
(I came with Shen Chiyan.)

27
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,040
(I am his...)

28
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,879
You are his wife.

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,959
I know.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,200
What about it?

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,719
I still like you.

32
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,319
I mean,

33
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,280
I like to take you to have fun.

34
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,759
When I just came in,

35
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,159
Shen Chiyan announced to everyone

36
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,759
that you were only his secretary.

37
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,400
What kind of marriage is that?

38
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,120
(She's seducing someone again.)

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,240
(She just doesn't stop.)

40
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,039
Song Qinian.

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,439
Come here.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,120
Attention, please.

43
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,879
It's my dad's birthday.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,000
On this grand occasion,

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,280
I have

46
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,840
a huge surprise for him as his daughter.

47
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,560
Dad.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,599
Let's head to the pool in the garden.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,879
Let's go.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,840
Will there be fireworks?

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,639
I have no idea.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Here's the surprise.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,719
My older sister.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Lin Qiutong.

55
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,319
Isn't she...

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,639
That's Miss Qiutong.

57
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,439
Miss Qiutong.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
She has woken up.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,879
Miss Qiutong has woken up!

60
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,120
It's been three years.

61
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,280
She's still so beautiful.

62
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,800
What a miracle.

63
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,719
Qiutong.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,719
Qiutong.

65
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,960
Qiutong.

66
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,199
It's been three years.
You've finally woken up.

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
Qiutong, you've woken up.

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,599
It's been three years.

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,319
My Qiutong.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,599
Qiutong.

71
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,800
Qiutong.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,120
When did you wake up?

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,639
Why didn't you tell me?

74
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,360
My sister wants to see you
in her best state.

75
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,600
You don't know what she looked like...

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,199
Lanxing.

77
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,360
Qiutong.

78
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,360
Chiyan.

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,240
I know you've been

80
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,319
taking care of me for three years

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,319
without giving up.

82
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,079
Chiyan, you know?

83
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,800
The only thing that helped me wake up

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,879
was you.

85
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,639
Qiutong.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,959
Chiyan.

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,319
You've kept this tie.

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,199
I knew it.

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,879
I knew you'd still remember me.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,959
Of course.

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,600
Qiutong.

92
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,439
You've just recovered.

93
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,959
You need to rest.

94
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,600
Let's head back to the hospital.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,319
Chiyan.

96
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
I heard that you married Song Qinian.

97
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,759
You must be very happy now.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,079
Congratulations.

99
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,639
I hope I didn't disturb you
by showing up like this.

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,199
Qiutong.

101
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,199
It's not what you think.

102
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
I can explain.

103
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,360
Rest assured.

104
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,879
Chiyan.

105
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,360
Qiutong.

106
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,600
Mr. Guan.

107
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,680
Qiutong.

108
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
Qiutong, are you alright?

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,639
To the hospital.

110
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,360
Be careful.

111
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,672
- Qiutong.
- Qiutong.

112
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,240
Qiutong.

113
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,560
To the hospital.

114
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,560
To the hospital, hurry.

115
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,720
My brother.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,040
Long time no see.

117
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,689
(Three days ago)

118
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,680
They didn't take good care of you.

119
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
You cherish your hands the most

120
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,519
and hate long nails.

121
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,399
You apply hand cream every hour.

122
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,959
Only I know.

123
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,040
Qiutong.

124
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,839
I'm back.

125
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,399
I won't leave you again.

126
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:09,920
Qiutong.

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,319
Qiutong.

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,199
I'll get a doctor.

129
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,639
I'll get a doctor.

130
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,279
Chiyan.

131
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,279
Chi...

132
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,920
Chiyan.

133
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,360
Qiutong.

134
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,039
Do you know what you said

135
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,840
before falling into a coma
three years ago?

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,799
You said "Shen Chiyan".

137
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,399
Chiyan, look out.

138
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,679
Back then,

139
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,960
I only asked you

140
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,879
to frame Song Qinian's father
for kidnapping me.

141
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,679
I didn't ask you to hurt Shen Chiyan.

142
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,879
But I hated him.

143
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,639
He easily won you over. What about me?

144
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,559
I've been your dog for so many years.

145
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,759
And what did I get?

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,240
What did I get?

147
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,639
I'm sorry, Qiutong.

148
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,440
I shouldn't

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,279
shout at you.

150
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm sorry, Qiutong.

152
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,080
Sorry.

153
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,159
Qiwen.

154
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,200
Have you forgotten your promise?

155
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
No.

156
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
You said...

157
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,080
I swear I will

158
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,279
protect my princess
Lin Qiutong with my life.

159
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,600
I'll do anything for you.

160
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,960
Qiutong.

161
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,919
Only you treat me as a human.

162
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,080
Only you care about me, Qiutong.

163
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,159
Qiwen.

164
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,360
That's why you are not my dog.

165
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,320
You are my knight.

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,320
Do you understand?

167
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,399
I know.

168
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,279
Qiutong.

169
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,480
You're still very weak.

170
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,720
Rest well.

171
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,200
I will visit you tomorrow.
