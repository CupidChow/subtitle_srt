00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,120
Sorry.

5
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,159
Sorry.

00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,560
(Thank you.)

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,040
(You know sign language?)

9
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,319
I know a little bit.

00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,760
My grandma opened a special school.

But in this life, I know

46
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,439
you love baby's breath the most.

47
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,279

Qinian,

51
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,040
don't you want me anymore?

52
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,879
Still hurt?

53
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,199
But what about me?

54
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,079
It's been hurting me for three years.

55
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,319
Every time I went to
the hospital, it hurt.

56
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,600
Every time Lin Qiutong
held your hand, it hurt.

57
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,439
Every time you said
you didn't love me, it hurt.

58
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,360
Shen Chiyan,

59
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
I don't want to hurt anymore.
