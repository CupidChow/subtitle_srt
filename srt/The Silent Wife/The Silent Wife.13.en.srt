=The Silent Wife=

00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:45,340
=Episode 13=
(He's Not an Object. He's a Person)

3
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,320
(Chiyan, your coffee.)

4
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,880
Not now.

5
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,519
Sir.

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
Good news.

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,280
The hospital says
that Song Guanliang is better

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
and can see Mrs. Shen.

9
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,359
Will you tell her the good news

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,799
or shall I pass it on?

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,200
Go ahead and tell her.

12
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,400
(So the person I always liked)

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
(before the accident was Qiutong.)

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Why is she here?

15
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,280
Her dad is on medical parole.

16
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,159
Chiyan even found him a doctor

17
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,560
at the hospital.

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,079
I didn't expect

19
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,079
he would go to such lengths
for Song Qinian.

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,439
(Dad.)

21
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,039
Qinian.

22
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,240
Qinian.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
(Dad.)

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,400
You've lost weight.

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,199
(Dad, how are you feeling?)

26
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,199
(Where do you hurt?)

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,479
The doctor said that

28
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,639
I recovered quite well.

29
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,479
Chiyan found

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
a good doctor for me.

31
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,479
He was so nice to me.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,199
I bet he would

33
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,840
treat you well.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,199
You liked him so much at college.

35
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,240
Now that you are married,

36
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,879
I can rest assured.

37
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,319
(Yeah.)

38
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,360
(Both Chiyan and Grandma
are very nice to me.)

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,599
(Actually,)

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,919
(I've been investigating
the kidnapping case.)

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,879
You can't do that.

42
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,159
(Lin Qiutong has woken up.)

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,319
(She promised to testify that)

44
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,759
(you weren't the kidnapper.)

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
(But Dad,)

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,840
(why did you confess?)

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,680
Qinian.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,479
Stop the investigation.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
(Tell me)

50
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,879
(or I'll keep looking into it.)

51
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,400
(I'd like to get to the bottom of it.)

52
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,000
It's all my fault.

53
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,840
Just stop the investigation.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,680
(Dad, are you alright?)

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,000
Qinian.

56
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,759
You've been a stubborn kid.

57
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,439
And you haven't

58
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,080
changed a bit as a grownup.

59
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,560
I only want you

60
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,919
and your mom

61
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,560
to be safe and sound.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,840
Nothing else matters.

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
(Safe and sound?)

64
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,360
(What about you?)

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,840
(Chiyan will protect me.)

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,960
(Just tell me the truth.)

67
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,360
(Otherwise,)

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,639
(I can't establish myself
in the Shen family.)

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
Three years ago,

70
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,560
(a man told me...)

71
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,199
Do you see it?

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,039
Don't hurt Qinian.

73
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,120
Don't hurt Qinian.

74
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,280
As long as you behave,

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,600
I promise she'll be fine.

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,759
Got it?

77
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,040
Come sit here.

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,120
Drive.

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,279
You hit someone with your car.

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
Take the blame

81
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,759
and your girl will be fine.

82
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,519
Got it?

83
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,879
Got it?

85
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,560
Yeah.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,279
(Dad.)

87
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
(You did it for me?)

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,639
(I got you into this.)

89
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Qinian.

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,199
I'm willing to do anything

91
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,560
to keep you safe and sound.

92
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,199
(But Dad,)

93
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,279
(I wasn't kidnapped three years ago.)

94
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,279
(Nor was I ever filmed.)

95
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,959
(It was all fake.)

96
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,680
(Dad.)

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,199
(Do you remember)

98
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,480
(if that man
had any distinctive features?)

99
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,800
Right.

100
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,000
I remember

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,759
he had a scar on his face.

102
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,959
From here to here.

103
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,680
It was this long.

104
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,720
(Who is he really?)

105
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:28,608
(Inpatient Department)

106
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,519
Get in the car.

107
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
I suddenly remembered some things

108
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,639
about what happened three years ago.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Miss Song.

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't you want to know?

111
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,720
Nanxun.

112
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,639
Follow them.

113
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,399
(What is it?)

114
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,399
Let me tell you the truth.

115
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,759
Three years ago,

116
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,800
Song Guanliang kidnapped me for money.

117
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,720
I scratched his neck
while I was escaping.

118
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,120
Later,

119
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,759
Chiyan came with the ransom

120
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,600
just when I was running out.

121
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,759
That's why Song Guanliang went all in

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,879
and hit us with his car.

123
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,199
That's the truth.

124
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,319
(Liar.)

125
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,040
Of course.

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,759
I can help you.

127
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,240
I can tell everyone

128
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,519
that there was

129
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,199
a third person there.

130
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,360
It was that person who kidnapped me

131
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,839
and framed Song Guanliang.

132
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,199
Then your dad would be free.

133
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
However,

134
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
you have to do something.

135
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,439
Divorce Chiyan.

136
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,319
Do you love him?

137
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,040
Song Qinian, I envy you so much.

138
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,959
I've loved Chiyan for so many years.

139
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,439
I can't live without him.

140
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,439
As long as you two get divorced,

141
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,759
I'll say whatever you want me to say

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,319
and do whatever you want me to do.

143
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,199
(He's not an object.)

144
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,639
(He's a person.)

145
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,160
Give him back to me

146
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,399
and your dad will be free.

147
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,680
The truth is not that important.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,920
Don't you

149
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,000
want to reunite with your family?

150
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,319
(I can leave Shen Chiyan.)

151
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,160
Chiyan, you're here.

152
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,079
Song Qinian admitted it.

153
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,439
She doesn't love you at all.

154
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,319
She will leave you as long as

155
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,720
I give a false testimony.

156
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,399
See for yourself.

157
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,959
(I can leave Shen Chiyan.)

158
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,120
Song

159
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,399
Qi...

160
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,919
nian.

161
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,360
(I can explain.)

162
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,759
What am I to you, after all?

163
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,440
Say no more.

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,759
I'm leaving.

165
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,759
Miss Song.

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,759
I've paid the bill.

167
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,039
You're welcome.

168
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,440
Bye.

169
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,679
Those who kidnapped Qinian all ran away.

170
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,440
I didn't know they had accomplices.

171
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,600
They were targeting Qinian.

172
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,639
We must look into it.

173
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,639
Why don't you do it?

174
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,639
Shen Chiyan.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
What did you say?

176
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,559
What happens to Song Qinian

177
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,399
is none of my business.

178
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Shen Chiyan.

179
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,639
It's none of your business?

180
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,840
Fine.

181
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,360
I'll look into it.

182
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:55,840
(Jianghai Zhuoai Hospital)

183
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,039
Miss Lin.

184
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,679
Qinian has told me

185
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,559
that you'd testify for me

186
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,960
to clear my name.

187
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
I didn't expect you to be

188
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,799
even more naive than your daughter.

189
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,200
She lied to you.

190
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,279
I'm here

191
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,000
to tell you what happened back then.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,799
Chiyan and I have been
childhood sweethearts.

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
If Song Qinian

194
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,399
hadn't shamelessly seduced Chiyan,

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,039
I wouldn't have

196
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,519
staged that kidnapping drama by myself

197
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,360
which led to your separation.

198
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,039
You...

199
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,399
You staged it yourself?

200
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,639
All the evidence shows that
you kidnapped me

201
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,039
and I was the victim.

202
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,639
But I didn't expect that

203
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,879
Song Qinian still managed
to marry Chiyan.

204
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,320
But it doesn't matter.

205
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,039
The person Chiyan likes is me.

206
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,200
They are going to get divorced soon.

207
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,080
No way.

208
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,200
They're happily married.

209
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,679
Happily married?

210
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,879
But Chiyan has never admitted

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,159
that he's married to Song Qinian.

212
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,399
He only treats her as a secretary.

213
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,440
At home, even the nanny can bully her.

214
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
That poor mute girl had to give me

215
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,600
blood transfusions.

216
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,039
No matter

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,799
what you say today,

218
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,799
I won't believe it.

219
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
Qinian has been happy.

220
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,799
Chiyan is a good son-in-law.

221
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,399
Otherwise, I would have
died from illness.

222
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,919
Seeing is believing.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,039
Here's your daughter's happy marriage.

224
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,320
You still don't get it, huh?

225
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,679
Shen Chiyan
has given you to me as a gift.

226
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,919
Speaking of which,

227
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,360
she's been struggling

228
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,039
yet you can't do anything.

229
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
You really are useless.

230
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
(Song Qinian.)

231
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,759
(Don't blame me.)

232
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,120
(You just wouldn't
stop the investigation.)

233
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,759
(Or I wouldn't have done this.)

234
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,600
(Your father died because of you.)

235
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,519
Cardiac arrest in Ward No. 6.

236
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
Get the emergency team

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
to Ward No. 6 now.

238
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,400
(Congratulations.
You're five weeks pregnant.)

239
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,288
(Ultrasound Report)
(The baby is very healthy.)

240
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,399
(Is the baby's father here?)

241
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,360
(It's still in the early stages.)

242
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,120
(Extra care is needed.)

243
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,919
This is the hospital.

244
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Are you Song Qinian,
Song Guanliang's daughter?

245
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
Song Guanliang just passed away

246
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,919
due to a cardiac arrest.

247
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,159
We did everything we could.

248
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,639
Please come to the hospital.

249
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,960
Our condolences.

250
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,799
Dad.
