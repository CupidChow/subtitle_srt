(Stop Humiliating Yourself)

3
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,880
So you've been married to Guan Mingxu
for three years

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
and I'm your bestie,

5
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,920
but you don't know him?

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,479
This is bad.

7
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,600
It's Qinian's turn to have amnesia.

8
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,079
Qinian,

9
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,359
look.

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,400
Look at this.

11
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,879
Don't come any closer.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,079
Guan Mingxu.

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,680
Can you make them all leave?

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm scared.

15
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,239
Doctor.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,280
The patient is very weak now.

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,159
You guys

18
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,920
must not agitate her anymore.

19
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,000
Too many people here

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,480
will affect her rest.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
Qinian has not yet recovered.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,879
Don't be anxious.

23
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,640
Chiyan, let's go back.

24
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,400
Come on.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,359
Take it slow.

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
Shen Qiwen.

27
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,200
It's been confirmed

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,719
that the kid is gone.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,959
And

30
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,159
she seems to have amnesia.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,319
Shen Qiwen!

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,359
Feeling better?

33
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,760
I warned you not to play tricks.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,840
You still hurt her?

35
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,400
She lost her balance.

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Why are you blaming me now?

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,439
Mr. Shen,

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,360
stop it.

39
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,319
Chiyan,

40
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,479
stop fighting.

41
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,199
Come on.

42
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,759
Stop.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,919
Shen Chiyan,

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,599
how does it feel to lose your child?

45
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,520
Shen Qiwen,

46
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,800
starting today,

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,080
you are no longer our family.

48
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,960
It's not your call.

49
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,439
You think Grandma didn't know
you injured your face

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
to frame me when you were a kid?

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,639
She knew?

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,719
Why...

53
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,919
Because she's your grandma.

54
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,039
You better know what you've done.

55
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,400
Take your time and think it through.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,120
Mr. Shen, Miss Lin is here.

57
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,280
You're not needed here.

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,039
You may leave.

59
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,560
Okay.

60
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,439
Chiyan.

61
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,439
Chiyan,

62
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,319
are you alright?

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Shen Chiyan.

64
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,000
Stop struggling.

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
She doesn't need you anymore.

66
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,919
Let's go.

67
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,039
I'll take you back to your room.

68
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,720
Chiyan.

69
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,839
Look, this dress

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,439
suits me, right?

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
Chiyan,

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
look,

73
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,920
do I look like Song Qinian?

74
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,079
Come on.

75
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,399
Let's take photos together.

76
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,639
Lin Qiutong?

77
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,439
Is that you?

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
It's been long since we graduated.

79
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,879
Why did you come to my place?

80
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,720
I came to see you, of course.

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,120
You dare to come again?

82
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,199
Mingxu,

83
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,240
did you know Qiutong before?

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,319
Is there any misunderstanding
between you two?

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,560
She's pretty nice.

86
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,839
Song Qinian,

87
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,519
stop pretending.

88
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,040
You think faking amnesia

89
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,560
can help you get Chiyan's attention?

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,839
You're not worthy.

91
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,040
Hold on, Mingxu.

92
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,720
She mentioned Chiyan.

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,680
Who's Chiyan?

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,399
What are you trying to say?

95
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,000
See for yourself.

96
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,000
Qiutong,

97
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,279
you're pretty open, huh?

98
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,199
Who is this guy?

99
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,759
Why show me this?

100
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,639
Still pretending?

101
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,240
Song Qinian,

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,920
stop pretending.

103
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,279
Drop the act.

104
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,959
Get out of here!

105
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,000
Guan Mingxu!

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,199
Song Qinian,

107
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,920
I don't believe you can take it
after seeing the photos.

108
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Open the door now!

109
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,040
This isn't over!

110
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,680
I won't let you off.

111
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
I won't let you off!

112
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,959
Mr. Shen really isn't here.

113
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,120
Mr. Guan.

114
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,120
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry.

115
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,879
Nanxun.

116
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
You can leave us.

117
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,439
Go ahead.

118
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,439
What is it?

119
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,439
Something dirty.

120
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,279
An hour ago,

121
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,600
Lin Qiutong took these photos
to see Qinian.

122
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,319
I was drunk that night.

123
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,800
You don't need to explain to me.

124
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,000
I came today to warn you.

125
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,559
Don't bother Qinian anymore.

126
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,360
Guan Mingxu,

127
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,200
if she hadn't lost her memory,

128
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,559
you wouldn't be able to stay
by her side.

129
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,799
There's no if.

130
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,120
Don't forget how you treated her before.

131
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,200
If you have even a bit of remorse,

132
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,759
keep Lin Qiutong in line.

133
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,639
I'm telling you.

134
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,720
It's not your turn to accuse me.

135
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,440
What can you do?

136
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,440
Qinian only recognizes me now.

137
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,279
I'm going to the countryside with her
to visit her grandma.

138
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
Chiyan, you're here.

139
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,600
Lin Qiutong,

140
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,480
why did you do that?

141
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,080
Chiyan,

142
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,440
don't get mad.

143
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,720
Hear me out.

144
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,679
The day I woke up

145
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,320
was the happiest day

146
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,039
ever

147
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,320
in my life.

148
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,799
Because I found out

149
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,240
the person you like is me.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,159
Turns out

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,480
it wasn't just my wishful thinking.

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Can you stop it?

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
I remember everything now.

154
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,759
The person I like is Song Qinian.

155
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,519
I was going to confess my feelings
to Qinian that day.

156
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Stop humiliating yourself.

157
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
How's that possible?

158
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,360
Chiyan,

159
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,720
when did you regain your memory?

160
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,960
Lin Qiutong,

161
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,600
give me back Qinian's whistle.

162
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
No.

163
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,960
Give the whistle back to me!

164
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,759
It's not like that, Chiyan.

165
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,759
The person you like is me.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,799
The whistle.

167
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,639
Chiyan.

168
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,960
Give it to me.

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm warning you one last time.

170
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,720
If you dare to mess with Qinian again,

171
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,200
I can't guarantee
what will happen to your family.

172
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,799
Chiyan.

173
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,120
Don't leave.

174
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,000
Song Qinian has already forgotten you.

175
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,080
Then I'll start over with her.

176
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,279
Besides,

177
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,720
I don't ever want to see you again.

178
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,080
How come?

179
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,480
No.

180
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,159
No way.

181
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,200
Why?

182
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,080
Qiwen.

183
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,799
Qiutong.

184
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,360
You still have me.

185
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,200
Qiwen.

186
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,960
What should I do next?

187
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,200
I'll listen to you.

188
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,960
Okay.

189
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
(I'll take back everything
that belongs to me.)
