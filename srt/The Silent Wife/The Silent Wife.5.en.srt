(Put On An Act With Me)

3
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:05,293
(Invitation)

4
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,239
(The Lin family)

5
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,840
(hates Song Qinian so much.)

6
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,120
(Yet they invited her
to the birthday party?)

7
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,040
(Inpatient Department)

8
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
It's not six months
since Miss Song's last blood donation.

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Plus, Miss Lin's condition has already
stabilized and she's out of danger.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,920
Thanks for making the trip.

11
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,239
Shen Chiyan,

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
how dare you use your wife's blood

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,040
to support an outsider?

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,439
(No, no.)

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,519
(I didn't donate blood.)

16
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,319
Grandma,

17
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,799
Qiutong is not an outsider.

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
Have you forgotten

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,640
that Qiutong risked her life saving me?

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,400
Besides,

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,439
she's Song Guanliang's daughter.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,879
Shouldn't she atone for her dad's sins?

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,200
Song Guanliang
has already been imprisoned.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,959
What sins is Qinian atoning for?

25
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,439
Grandma,

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,120
I believe Qiutong is the person I love.

27
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,439
Have you forgotten

28
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,719
that your dad and his mistress
faced their retribution

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,879
and had a car accident?

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
And then your mom settled abroad.

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,159
Do you want to repeat
your dad's mistakes?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,039
You want a mistress

33
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,479
and even want to use Qinian's blood?

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,840
How can you enjoy

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,319
all the good things in the world?

36
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,240
Grandma,

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,520
you don't know it.

38
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,319
It was Liu Xiaohan who came up
with the idea to donate blood.

39
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,039
She's asked me for quite a lot of money.

40
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,319
She's your mother-in-law.

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,080
You should respect and take care of her.

42
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,680
Respect

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
a mother-in-law who sent
her daughter to my bed,

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,800
huh?

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
Shen Chiyan,

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,960
listen up.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,919
Qinian is your wife.

48
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,560
Know your place.

49
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,319
Come home with me right now.

50
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,280
Qinian, let's go.

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,719
Let's go.

52
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,840
Wait for my return.

53
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,759
Qiutong,

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm back.

55
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Madam Shen,

56
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,920
here's some fruit.

57
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,199
Qinian, eat some fruit.

58
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,199
Why are your hands so cold?

59
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,839
You're so young,

60
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,360
but why do you look so pale?

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,439
You little brat.

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,920
How do you take care of Qinian?

63
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
(I'm fine.)

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,839
I granted your wishes
when you got married

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
and you didn't hold a wedding.

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,279
So not many people know
that Qinian is your wife.

67
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,519
It's been three years
since you got married.

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,759
It's time to make
your relationship public.

69
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,600
What do you want me to do?

70
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,319
I want everyone to know

71
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,879
that Qinian is my granddaughter-in-law

72
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,160
and Shen Chiyan's wife.

73
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
She's not.

74
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,000
If she's not, then who is?

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,759
What's between you and Lin Qiutong
is only gratitude.

76
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,240
Don't get confused.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
Qinian is good and kind-hearted.

78
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,399
She is the wife you should cherish.

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,000
Hurry up and announce her identity.

80
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,199
(Are you alright?)

81
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,319
Grandma,

82
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,600
I promise

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
to take her out more often.

84
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Is that okay?

85
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,279
Okay.

86
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,920
It's getting late.

87
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,120
Before you go to bed,

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
why not take a walk in the park?

89
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,759
I'll have a car take you back.

90
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm not going anywhere.

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm living here.

92
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,240
What?

93
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,199
Are you tired of me?

94
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,040
How would I dare?

95
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,600
Alright then.

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,079
You two go back to your room.

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Help Qinian.

98
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,079
Go.

99
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,240
Quickly.

100
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
She was unaware we haven't
shared a room. What now?

101
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,720
(I don't know either.)

102
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,959
Let's go.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
It's about time.

104
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm taking a shower.

105
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,199
When I come out,

106
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,399
don't let me see you here.

107
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,439
(He doesn't want to see me.)

108
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,639
(I can't stay in this room anymore.)

109
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,040
(Grandma.)

110
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,879
Qinian,

111
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,839
you're going out this late?

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
(I was a bit hungry just now.)

113
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
(Now I suddenly don't
feel hungry anymore.)

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,519
(I'll go back in.)

115
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,600
Why are you still here?

116
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,440
(I...)

117
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,120
(I couldn't get out.)

118
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,919
You and your excuses.

119
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,600
Chiyan,

120
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,639
are you hungry too?

121
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,600
Grandma,

122
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,759
you don't have to go to this length.

123
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Go inside.

124
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Looks like you'll have
to put on an act with me.

125
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,480
Keep jumping.

126
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,639
Keep jumping.

127
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,200
Let's go.

128
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,440
Stop.

129
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,600
It's been half an hour.

130
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,120
Grandma should have left.

131
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,919
Don't go to work tomorrow.

132
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,200
Take a good rest.

133
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,159
