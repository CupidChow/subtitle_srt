(Don't Forget Who You Are, Miss Song)

3
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:53,439
Miss Song.

4
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,280
(I have nothing left to lose.)

5
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,840
(This is the only thing I can do.)

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,400
Have none of you seen dancing before?

7
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,239
A few grown men bully a young girl.

8
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,159
That's too much.

9
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,959
Mr. Guan of the Guan Group.

10
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,400
Mr. Guan,

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,519
what are you doing?

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,560
Mr. Liang,

13
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,920
my dad said if I

14
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,640
can't secure the cooperation with you,

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll have to go back overseas.

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,760
It's you.

17
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,359
Song Qinian,

18
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,359
don't you remember me?

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,319
Mom,

20
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,599
I'm telling you one last time.

21
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,799
Keqin and I are friends.

22
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,200
Don't try to set us up.

23
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,680
(Are you alright?)

24
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,000
(I've seen a fairy.)

25
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,199
(Are you alright?)

26
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,319
(Are you alright?)

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,919
Well,

28
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,039
let's exchange contact info.

29
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,680
(Song Qinian.)

30
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,159
That day at the hotel,

31
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,599
you left your ID card behind.

32
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,479
No way.

33
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,520
She went to the hotel with Mr. Guan?

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,800
Didn't expect Miss Song to be so open.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Exactly.

36
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,000
Song Qinian,

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,800
how many more surprises
will you give me tonight?

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,199
Everyone,

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,800
Miss Song

40
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,120
is not feeling well.

41
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,280
Please excuse us.

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,919
Mr. Shen,

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,319
didn't you see I was
catching up with Qinian?

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,599
Mr. Guan,

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
Song Qinian is my secretary.

46
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,199
I hope you can keep
some distance from her.

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
Aren't you being a bit too meddlesome?

48
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,159
This is between Qinian and me.

49
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go.

50
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,000
You really attract a lot of
attention, Song Qinian.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,759
What's your relationship with him?

52
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,519
(It's none of your business.)

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,560
How dare you, Song Qinian?

54
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,959
(I don't have to explain myself to you.)

55
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,759
(Just like you never explained
that I'm your wife.)

56
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,680
(That's fair.)

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,920
Are you talking to me about fairness?

58
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,120
Tell me

59
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,000
how you seduce Mr. Guan.

60
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,879
The way he looks at you makes me sick.

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
You flatter Mr. Liang

62
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
and hook up with Mr. Guan.

63
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,959
You are really quite something.

64
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,759
(I didn't.)

65
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,360
(You can ignore me.)

66
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,480
(But you can't slander me.)

67
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,560

Before Qiutong wakes up,

77

Now, go back to the car immediately.

79

Do not set foot in the private room.

80

Miss Song.

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
Please take a seat.

85
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Miss Song,

86
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,879
it's your first time attending
such an event, right?

87
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,879
It's all

88
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,279
just for show.

89
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,439
Don't take it to heart.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,079
(I know that.)

91
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,480
(Thank you, Mr. Chen.)

92
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,480
I

93
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,839
just think you are about the same age
as my daughter.

94
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,279
By the way,

95
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,079
if you don't usually drink,

96
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,319
after drinking so much at once,

97
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
you need some hangover pills.

98
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,600
I happen to have brought some today.

99
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:48,800
Come on.

100
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,439
Your hand.

101
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,040
Here, some water.

102
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,040
Be careful.

103
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,759
Slow down.

104
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,480
(Thank you.)

105
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't mention it.

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,439
Feeling better?

107
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,279
Miss Song.

108
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,000
Miss Song, Miss Song.

109
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,120
Mr. Shen,

110
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,679
come on.

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,799
Take a seat.

112
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,200
Sorry.

113
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,200
Mr. Liang,

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,879
if you have any requests,

115
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,639
please tell me.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,759
Business negotiations take time.

117
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,039
No rush.

118
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
Where is Miss Song?

119
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,240
She's drunk.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
I told her to go home first.

121
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,519
You let her go alone?

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,879
What's it to you?

123
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
She's my secretary.

124
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,480
I'll be responsible for her safety.

125
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,960
You need to be responsible for too many.

126
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,279
Leave Qinian to me.

127
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm telling you today.

128
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,600
Qinian will be mine.

129
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,600
Mr. Shen, you better recruit
a new secretary.

130
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,600
You're a bit too confident.

131
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,480
I don't have time for you.

132
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,600
Qinian is waiting for me.

133
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,799
Mr. Liang, I must take my leave.

134
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:20,840
Mr. Liang.

135
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,639
(Song Qinian,)

136
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,440
(I shouldn't have brought you
here today.)

137
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,039
Mr. Shen,

138
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,759
I've seen

139
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,840
your sincerity.

140
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,559
Tomorrow, I'll personally visit
your company to discuss cooperation.

141
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,879
There will surely be
a satisfactory answer.

142
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,879
Then, I'm leaving now.

143
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll see him out.

144
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,000
Be careful.

145
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,879
Take it easy.

146
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,279
Right, be careful.

147
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,120
Be careful.

148
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,320
Mr. Shen,

149
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,840
I'm impressed.

150
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,919
Be careful.

151
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,919
