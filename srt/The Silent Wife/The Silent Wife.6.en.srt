=The Silent Wife=

2
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,404
=Episode 6=
(Miss Qiutong Has Woken Up)

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,439
Mrs. Shen.

4
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,560
(Li, I want to ask you something.)

5
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,840
(Did my mom ever ask Shen Chiyan
for money before?)

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,560
You shouldn't ask me this.

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,000
(How much?)

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,439
(Just tell me.)

9
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,519
Roughly

10
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,319
a few hundred thousand.

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,239
Mrs. Shen.

12
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,319
It's about time

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,480
to pick up Mr. Shen.

14
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,719
Come on.

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,200
I've been losing up till now.

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,840
Can you play faster?

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,760
Too slow.

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,719
Exactly.

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,879
Who is it?

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,680
Really.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
Who is it?

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Why are you here?

23
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,760
It's alright.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,719
My daughter came back.

25
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,519
Let's continue.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,799
Didn't your mute daughter marry
a wealthy man?

27
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,000
My daughter did marry a wealthy man.

28
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,560
Don't go, you guys.

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,280
You want to leave
after winning my money?

30
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,520
Song Qinian,

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,719
you really are my nemesis.

32
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,159
(How much money did you take
from Chiyan?)

33
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,879
(Why did you ask him for money?)

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,759
(Why?)

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,319
After all, I'm his mother-in-law.

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,759
He only gave me two hundred thousand.

37
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,240
He was really stingy.

38
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,360
Mr. Gao,

39
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,919
what brings you here?

40
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,439
I'm here to get my money back.

41
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,960
Give me a few more days...

42
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,919
Mr. Gao,

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
she's my daughter.

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,759
She has money.

45
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,599
Her husband is Shen Chiyan,
the president of Prosperity Group.

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,400
He'll pay you back.

47
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,199
If she were Shen Chiyan's wife,

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,759
I'd be Shen Chiyan's dad.

49
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,800
Gorgeous,

50
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,919
what do you say?

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
(How much money do you owe him?)

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,199
Five hundred thousand.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,159
She's even a mute.

54
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,159
Too bad,

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,599
not five hundred thousand,

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
but one million.

57
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,120
This is extortion.

58
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,120
Take it out.

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,560
Extortion?

60
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,800
It's written here.

61
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,159
Don't borrow it if you can.

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,159
(Where's the money
Shen Chiyan gave you?)

63
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,360
I lost it all.

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,919
Today, you have two choices.

65
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,879
First,

66
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,719
doesn't your mom love to gamble?

67
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,800
I'll chop her hands off.

68
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,599
Then she can't gamble anymore.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,319
(Second.)

70
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,639
Second,

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,960
serve me well in front of my man.

72
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,879
I can give you a few more days.

73
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,960
Let go of my daughter, Mr. Gao.

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
Let go of my daughter.

75
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,840
Let her go.

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,800
Great figure.

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,960
Let her go.

78
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,360
You dare hit me?

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
You still have something valuable.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,519
Give it to me.

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,519
Let go of her!

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,199
Let go of her!

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Don't!

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,759
Stop it!

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,279
Stop it!

86
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,160
My son-in-law has arrived.

87
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,000
You'll face the consequences.

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
Come to Prosperity Group tomorrow.

89
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Get out now!

90
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,720
Get out!

91
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,040
I'll let the legal department
take care of it.

92
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,759
Don't worry.

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,639
(Thank you.)

94
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,319
(I'll)

95
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,000
(pay you back.)

96
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,560
Whatever.

97
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,680
It's about time.

98
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,839
Let's go.

99
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,360
Chiyan.

100
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,519
Chiyan, you're here.

101
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,959
Long time no see, Lanxing.

102
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,879
Chiyan,

103
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,240
I miss you so much.

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,680
Song Qinian?

105
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,920
How dare you come to our house?

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Get out of here.

107
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,240
We don't welcome you,

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,959
the daughter of the man responsible
for my sister's car accident.

109
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,240
Lanxing.

110
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,720
Why doesn't that woman speak?

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Is she a mute?

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
Haven't you heard what she said?

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,839
Her dad

114
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,040
caused Miss Qiutong to be in a coma
for three years.

115
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,480
Her dad kidnapped Miss Qiutong
for extortion.

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,360
This whole family is no good.

117
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,079
Miss Qiutong was so lively and cheerful,

118
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,279
but had to be bedridden for three years.

119
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,000
It's really too pitiful.

120
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,600
Why aren't you the one lying in bed?

121
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
Why don't you die?

122
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Stop it, Lanxing.

123
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
Chiyan!

124
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,639
The invitation includes
Song Qinian's name.

125
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,959
That's why I brought her here.

126
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,519
She owes your family an apology.

127
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,439
With what are you going
to apologize to us?

128
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,160
Do you think an apology

129
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,680
can make up for the harm
your dad did to my sister?

130
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,879
(My dad is innocent.)

131
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,519
(I will prove it to you.)

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
I almost forgot

133
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,560
you're a mute and can't apologize
with your words.

134
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,759
Then kneel down.

135
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,000
(My dad didn't do anything wrong.)

136
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
(I won't kneel.)

137
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Stop gesturing.

138
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,240
I don't understand it.

139
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,759
I'm now commanding you to kneel
and apologize to our family.

140
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,040
See?

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,079
Song Qinian,

142
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,079
Chiyan doesn't take you
seriously at all.

143
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,360
Get out of my face.

144
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,560
Qinian, are you okay?

145
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
(I'm fine, thank you.)

146
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
Qinian, I told you

147
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,199
to wait for me to come together.

148
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,920
How could you come here with my brother

149
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,240
and leave me alone with two gifts?

150
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,240
This is a task given by Grandma.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
Remember to give them to Mr. Lin.

152
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,519
My grandma has not been
in good health recently.

153
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
She asked my sister-in-law
to come on her behalf.

154
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,399
But you bullied my sister-in-law

155
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,480
in front of everyone.

156
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,040
Is this your family's way
of treating guests?

157
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,000
Chiyan,

158
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,240
won't you keep your sister in line?

159
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
Or,

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,960
do you really take Song Qinian
as your wife?

161
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,399
Say something.

162
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,879
Everyone,

163
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,759
sorry,

164
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,679
I haven't introduced her.

165
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,799
This is my wife,

166
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,080
Song Qinian.

167
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,559
Lanxing,

168
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,240
a visitor is a guest.

169
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't cause trouble.

170
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,480
Dad,

171
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,799
I didn't cause trouble.

172
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,360
This woman came just
to disgust us on purpose.

173
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
Today is your birthday.

174
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,919
Enough.

175
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,279
Someone,

176
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,600
take Lanxing back to her room.

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,720
Dad!

178
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,080
One of our girls has been in a coma
for three years.

179
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,679
Do you want to infuriate the other one?

180
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
You'd better shut up.

181
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,039
Everyone,

182
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,919
sorry to make you see that.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,279
Thank you all

184
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,799
for coming to my birthday party today.

185
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,159
Please forgive us

186
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,759
for any inadequacy in hospitality.

187
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,480
Alright, alright.

188
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,360
Miss Shen, sorry.

189
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,519
Mr. Lin,

190
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
I'm not the one you should apologize to.

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,919
My sister-in-law can't speak,

192
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,519
so I'll speak for her.

193
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,919
Grandma asked us to wish you
a happy birthday

194
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,559
and good health,
and may all go well with you.

195
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,960
Please thank Madam Shen
for her kindness.

196
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
Next, please enjoy yourselves.

197
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
I shall excuse myself first.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,200
Everyone, please proceed to the pool.

199
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,759
There's a surprise.

200
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,080
We're going to the pool?

201
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,200
Could it be a performance in the pool?
A mermaid show?

202
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,840
The surprise I've prepared
for everyone today

203
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,159
is my sister,

204
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,039
Lin Qiutong.

205
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,960
This is...

206
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,080
Look, isn't this...

207
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,679
It's Miss Lin Qiutong.

208
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,519
Miss Qiutong has woken up.

209
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,000
After three years,

210
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,879
why is she still so beautiful?

211
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,240
It's totally a miracle.

212
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,240
Look at Mr. Shen. He's the happiest one.

213
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,679
Qiutong.

214
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:09,960
Qiutong.

215
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,360
Qiutong, my Qiutong.

216
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,799
You're finally awake.

217
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,559
Qiutong.

218
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,720
When did you wake up?

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,240
Why didn't you tell me?
