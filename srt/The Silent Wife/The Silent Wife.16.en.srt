=Episode 16=
(Mama, Come Home with Me)

3
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,759
What's wrong? You look so gloomy.

4
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,759
It's all because of Lin Qiutong.

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,240
She caused so much trouble.

6
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,840
Now she has driven my sister-in-law
to divorce Chiyan.

7
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,320
Really?

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,840
She loves him so much.

9
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,799
Maybe she's trying to scare him.

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
I hope she's just scaring him.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,079
But this time
it's a lawsuit for divorce.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,640
Then,

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,840
are you siding with

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,640
Chiyan or Qinian?

15
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,040
Of course, I'm on Qinian's side.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,560
Chiyan is a punk.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
What are you laughing at?

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,239
You're not much better.

19
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,239
They say those who love to laugh
will not have bad luck.

20
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,280
Right,

21
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,239
I'll take Qinian out to have fun.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,719
Where are you going?

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,560
Count me in.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,799
I'm telling you.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,840
I've taken Qinian out to have fun.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,000
There are a lot of hot guys here.

27
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,840
You might as well resign yourself
to being alone.

28
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,079
Keqin,

29
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,040
what are we doing here?

30
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,680
It's fine, Qinian.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,599
Just enjoy yourself today.

32
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,799
Having fun matters most.

33
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,079
These are all my friends.

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,519
Hi.

35
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,879
Don't be shy.

36
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,599
Qinian.

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,879
To cure a heartbreak,

38
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,800
the best way is
to start another relationship.

39
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,439
Take your pick.

40
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,960
What's wrong, miss?

41
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,319
Are we not good enough?

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,479
Gorgeous,

43
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,520
I just want to ask about your hobbies.

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
Gorgeous, don't be nervous.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,479
We want to know
what type of guys you like.

46
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:31,840
I...

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,439
Someone like me, of course.

48
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,639
Isn't this Mr. Guan?

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,159
What brings you here?

50
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,159
Qinian,

51
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,919
what a coincidence.

52
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,919
I considered you a buddy.

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,759
You want to hit on my sister-in-law?

54
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,240
Anyway, Chiyan has no chance.

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,479
Just help me out.

56
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,400
No way.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,039
Qinian, I must tell you.

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,439
He is well-known as a playboy.

59
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,960
Dating two at a time
is even considered less.

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,639
That's right.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,919
He's never short of women.

62
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,840
She's drunk.

63
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm very faithful in relationships,

64
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
especially with you.

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,479
I have heard that many times.

66
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,759
Those were all just passersby.

67
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,159
Qinian is the only one.

68
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,680
Qinian, I'm serious.

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,960
Accept me, won't you?

70
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,080
No need.

71
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,400
You have no chance.

72
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,120
And you, Shen Keqin.

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,560
If you're bored, go work at the company.

74
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,159
Qinian,

75
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,919
let's go home.

76
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
Wherever Qinian goes is
none of your business.

77
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:39,960
Mr. Guan,

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
how could it not be my business?

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,080
You're my kid's mom.

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,159
What do you say?

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
Your kid?

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
She already has a kid
and still comes here?

83
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
She has a kid?

84
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,240
Look,

85
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,919
Mr. Guan's face has turned pale.

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,439
That's wasting our time.

87
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,400
Let's go drinking.

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,960
Okay.

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,479
What is this?

90
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,039
Didn't see this coming.

91
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,639
Grandma,

92
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,920
I have good news.

93
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,279
The child has nothing to do with you.

94
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,120
We'll never trouble you in this life.

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,079
Qinian,

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,920
our child won't be a burden.

97
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,319
Qinian,

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
don't lose it again.

99
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
Shen Chiyan,

100
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,240
you little rascal.

101
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,480
Qinian is pregnant.

102
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,759
You dare to ask for a divorce?

103
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,519
Bring Qinian home right now!

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,480
Okay.

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,639
Okay, I got it, Grandma.

106
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,160
You heard it.

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
Keqin told her

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,959
about your pregnancy.

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,639
Let's go home.

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,800
If you don't want to go back,

111
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,079
I can go by myself.

112
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,800
I'll go.

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,439
Qinian.

114
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,240
Grandma.

115
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,720
Come on.

116
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Come here.

117
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,360
Come on.

118
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,920
Silly girl.

119
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,879
If you're wronged, just come to me.

120
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,839
Why endure it all by yourself?

121
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,839
I'm fine.

122
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,519
I heard it from Keqin.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,279
As long as I'm here,

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
no one will bully you.

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,720
You brat.

126
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,160
You didn't even know
your wife is pregnant?

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,560
You went to a wedding dress store?

128
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,079
I think you're asking for a lesson.

129
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,839
Grandma,

130
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,600
even you don't believe me?

131
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,399
Shut up.

132
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,399
Qinian,

133
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,920
tell me the truth.

134
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Did he force you

135
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,879
to get a divorce?

136
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,040
No,

137
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,079
I asked for a divorce.

138
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,040
What?

139
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,279
Is there

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
really not a chance?

141
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,199
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,160
You're my granddaughter-in-law.

143
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Then I'll always be your grandma.

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,040
From now on,

145
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,160
I only acknowledge you and the kid.

146
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:16,879
Zhang.

147
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,319
Yes?

148
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,279
Have Qiao take good care of Qinian.

149
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:19,759
Okay.

150
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
You little brat.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,920
If Qinian doesn't forgive you,

152
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,959
don't you set foot in this house.

153
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,920
You better leave now.

154
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,879
Next week is the Ouyangs'
wedding anniversary.

155
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,240
Cheer her up at the party.

156
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,319
If you can't make her happy,
don't come home.

157
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,079
You've finally had it coming.

158
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,000
Have a seat.

159
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,959
Qinian, look.

160
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,040
This is Chiyan's precious photo album.

161
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,759
I took it from the old house.

162
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,560
Take a look.

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
Look at him.

164
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,439
He looked grouchy even as a kid.

165
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,600
By the way,

166
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,480
I'll go with you to
the checkup tomorrow.

167
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,839
Your baby can't turn out like him.

168
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,319
It's better if it takes after you.

169
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,240
Who is this boy?

170
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Him?

171
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,679
Shen Qiwen.

172
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,360
My uncle had an affair.

173
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
He insisted on a divorce

174
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,240
and then brought back that kid.

175
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,120
Later, they went on a honeymoon

176
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,679
but had a car accident.

177
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,159
His wife and he passed away.

178
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,200
Unexpectedly,

179
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,360
Chiyan still kept this photo.

180
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,679
But this is probably the only one left.

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,159
After he had the accident,

182
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
he disliked taking photos

183
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,759
and seldom went out of the house.

184
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,200
Accident?

185
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,879
What kind of accident?

186
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,919
Only our family knows about it.

187
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,759
He fought with Chiyan
when they were young.

188
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,360
He fell on an aquarium

189
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,360
and was left with a long scar.

190
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,360
He removed it after having
surgery abroad.

191
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,600
He had a scar?

192
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,799
Yes.

193
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
What did it look like?

194
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,679
It roughly

195
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,559
went from here to here,

196
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,559
a very long one.

197
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,200
(Right,)

198
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,399
(I remember)

199
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,759
he had a scar on his face.

200
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,960
From here to here.

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,559
It was this long.

202
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,279
(What a coincidence.)

203
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,559
Everything's ready for the checkup.

204
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,720
Could you help me check it?

205
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,639
Okay, Qinian.

206
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,639
Have a good rest.

207
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:53,960
Okay.

208
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,919
I'll join you tomorrow.

209
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,039
Find me Shen Qiwen's photo
