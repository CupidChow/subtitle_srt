(Seducing Someone Again)

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,200
Let's talk this over.

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,039
(Dad, I'm exhausted.)

5
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,759
(No one in this world loves me.)

6
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,000
(No one believes me.)

7
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,319
Song Qinian.

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,519
You are mine.

9
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,319
Without my permission,

10
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,560
you don't have the right
to hurt yourself.

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
Dr. Pei.

12
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,359
When will Qiutong wake up?

13
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,840
Miss Lin has recovered fairly well.

14
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,000
But we can't tell

15
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,319
when she will wake up for sure.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
It might be a month

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,680
or two to three years.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Please look after her, Dr. Pei.

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
Keep me updated at any time.

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, Mr. Shen.

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,560
And Miss Song

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,359
is in a poor health condition.

23
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,479
She's a bit anemic.

24
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,599
She should get some nutrition.

25
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,319
That will improve the quality
of her blood.

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,759
I see.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,599
Okay, Mr. Shen.

28
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,199
Sir, are you okay?

29
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,240
After that car accident three years ago,

30
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,560
you lost parts of your memory

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
and developed this constant headache.

32
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,159
When the accident happened...

33
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,280
Chiyan, be careful.

34
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,840
It was Qiutong who saved me.

35
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,919
She gave me a second life.

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
I will definitely protect her

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
until she wakes up.

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Oh, right.

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,879
How is Song Qinian?

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,599
I sent Mrs. Shen to rest
in the next ward.

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
She is still weak

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,639
from the transfusion.

43
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,400
Okay.

44
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,520
Qiutong.

45
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,479
I will wait for you to wake up.

46
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,256
(Inpatient Department)

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Stop talking nonsense.

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,240
See, I told you so.

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,599
Seducing someone again.

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,319
You should smile more.

51
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,240
It's good for your health

52
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,840
to be positive...

53
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,039
Mr. Shen.

54
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,039
Mr. Shen.

55
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,840
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,599
Get out.

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,240
Why aren't you smiling?

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
Weren't you just smiling at them?

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,719
Why are you pulling a long face now?

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,759
Am I that scary?

61
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,000
Weren't you bold enough
to climb into my bed

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
last night?

63
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,120
Well, Mr. Shen.

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,920
Should I arrange
for Mr. Song Guanliang's consultation?

65
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,759
Why bother?

66
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,639
Cancel it.

67
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,720
(I've saved Lin Qiutong.)

68
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,759
(Shouldn't you save my dad?)

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,959
Even if I don't save Song Guanliang,

70
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,639
what can you do?

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,360
(I can't do anything to you.)

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,800
(Because you're Shen Chiyan.)

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,920
You've worked hard.

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,360
Song Qinian.

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,279
There is an important banquet tomorrow.

76
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,680
Song Guanliang's fate

77
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,160
is in your hands.

78
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,639
(Do I look fine in this outfit?)

79
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,680
It's alright.

80
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
Let's go

81
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000
The clients are waiting.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
(This is my first time
meeting Chiyan's friends.)

83
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
(I must not drop the ball.)

84
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,959
(I won't hold you back.)

85
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,199
Okay.

Mr. Shen.

99
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,600
Mr. Shen, I've heard so much about you.

100
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,480
Me too, Mr. Liang.

101
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,600
Wait, Miss Song.

102
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,240
Mr. Liang is the protagonist today.

103
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,399
Please sit here.

104
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,240
Mr. Chen.

105
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,360
That's Mr. Guan's seat.

106
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,959
It's alright.

107
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Sit.

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,199
Just do as Mr. Liang says.

109
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,480
Come on, sit down.

110
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,120
Be careful.

111
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,800
Mr. Liang.

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,000
Please meet

113
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,680
my secretary

114
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Song Qinian.

115
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,360
You're such a lucky man, Mr. Shen.

116
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Your secretary is such a beauty.

117
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,879
Yeah.

118
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,639
I bet

119
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,439
your mysterious wife
is even more beautiful.

120
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,439
The ring.

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,839
(Shen Chiyan.)

122
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,680
(You really)

123
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,199
(don't want others
to know I'm your wife, huh?)

124
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,680
Miss Song.

125
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,960
Can you drink?

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,120
Drink to your heart's content today.

127
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,720
(I can't really hold my liquor.)

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,639
What's with the sign language?

129
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,480
I don't get it.

130
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,720
Sorry about that, Mr. Liang.

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,559
Miss Song

132
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,279
is mute.

133
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,159
She's mute?

134
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
A mute secretary?

135
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,120
Mr. Shen knows how to pick workers.

136
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,279
How interesting.

137
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,120
A mute is good.

138
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,639
A mute is good.

139
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,759
Yeah.

140
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,840
A mute is good.

141
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,440
Come on.

142
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,919
The first drink must be a toast

143
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,039
to the beauty.

144
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,360
Miss Song.

145
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,600
Miss Song.

146
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,120
(Mr. Liang.)

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,399
(I toast to you.)

148
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,159
(Please consider our collaboration.)

149
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,519
That's forthright.

150
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,159
Mr. Shen.

151
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
If I don't agree to the collaboration,

152
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,519
Miss Song

153
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,000
won't let me off, will she?

154
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,039
Mr. Liang.

155
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,320
Sorry.

156
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,559
My secretary is inexperienced.

157
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,039
I'll drink as a punishment.

158
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,440
Mr. Shen.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
I don't think
you have enough wine in there.

160
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,960
Listen.

161
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,759
Mr. Shen.

162
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,559
Mr. Liang.

163
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,600
I have an idea.

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
Why don't we

165
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,320
ask Miss Song to dance for us?

166
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,279
What do you say?

167
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,080
Alright.

168
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,000
Miss Song has a great figure.

169
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,200
She must be

170
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,919
a great dancer.

171
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,399
Applaud.

172
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,799
Let's hear some applause.

173
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,200
That's right.

174
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,080
Mr. Shen's secretary must be talented.

175
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,679
Absolutely.

176
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,480
Miss Song.

177
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,320
Dance on the table.

178
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,120
Yeah.

179
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,600
It's best to dance on stage.

180
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,919
Come on.

181
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,519
Miss Song.

182
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,799
Go up there, Miss Song.

183
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:25,960
Miss Song.

184
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,559
Make Mr. Liang happy

185
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,960
so that he works with us.

186
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,039
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

187
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,759
Miss Song, dance for us.

188
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,000
Show some sincerity.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,799
Come on.

190
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,279
(Dad is waiting for me to save him.)

191
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,200
(I have to make Shen Chiyan happy.)

192
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,360
If you don't secure
