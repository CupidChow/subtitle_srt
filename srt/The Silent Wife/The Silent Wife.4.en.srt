(I'm Your Wife, Don't Order Me Around)

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,799
Come on, let me have fun.

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,439
Let me have a good look at you.

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,039
I knew it.

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,319
How could Shen Chiyan not touch
such a pretty woman?

7
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,359
(Please, let me go.)

8
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,000
Say it, and I'll let you go.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,319
Say it.

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,920
Mr. Shen,

11
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,439
what about Mrs. Shen?

12
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,480
Isn't she in the car?

13
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,159
No.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,760
Hey, Mr. Shen.

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,760
Mr. Shen.

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,480
Mr. Shen, I've taken care of it.

17
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,000
This time, we'll definitely secure

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
this collaboration.

19
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,280
What have you done?

20
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,680
Actually, I didn't do much.

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,680
Mr. Shen, you always have your way.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,719
You brought over such a beauty
like Miss Song.

23
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,239
Mr. Liang

24
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,760
took a liking to her at first sight.

25
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,959
Speaking of which,

26
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,280
this is all thanks to Miss Song.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,879
You still don't understand
the situation, huh?

28
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,280
Shen Chiyan has given you
to me as a gift.

29
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,040
(How come?)

30
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,799
(Shen Chiyan,)

31
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,719
(how can you humiliate me like this?)

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
He has a mute secretary.

33
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,079
Come on.

34
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,200
I'd like to hear

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,319
how you moan in bed.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,799
The more you struggle,

37
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,159
the more excited I get.

38
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,360
Tell me, where is she now?

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,159
Mr. Shen, rest assured.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,520
Miss Song must

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,840
be serving Mr. Liang quite well.

42
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,479
Wait,

43
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,080
Mr. Shen.

44
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,280
Keep running.

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Run.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,759
Why don't you run?

47
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,360
Come back with me.

48
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,639
I haven't finished yet.

49
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,000
Shen Chiyan,

50
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,280
are you insane?

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,080
Do you know what this contract
means to you?

52
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,680
It's your group's
biggest order this year.

53
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't want it anymore.

54
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,240
Mr. Liang.

55
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,840
Take your darn order

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,520
and get out of here now!

57
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,599
Fine.

58

59
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,840
Yes?

60
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,120
Record it.

61
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,240
Alright.

62

Mr. Liang of a listed company

63
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,319
suddenly had a mental illness

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,400
and ran wild in a hotel at midnight.

65
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,759
Shen Chiyan, just you wait.

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Is this headline catchy
enough, Mr. Liang?

67
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,399

I didn't.

Chiyan,

130
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,840
I agree to your request.

131
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
You won't hold the wedding.

132
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,039
But from now on,

133
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,919
you must treasure Qinian

134
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,159

135
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,200
