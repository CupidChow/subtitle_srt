(Loving Couples Stay Close Together)

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,399
Loving couples stay close together.

4
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,560
(Rest assured.)

5
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,439
(I've already read through
the files you gave me.)

6
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,599
(I won't mess it up.)

7
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,480
Okay.

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,120
Come on.

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,799
Sorry.

10
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,439
Look at them.

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Sorry about that.

12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,959
Please don't mind us.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Let me introduce you.

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
This is my wife,

15
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,760
Song Qinian.

16
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:57,799
Qinian.

17
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
This is Mr. Ouyang.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,920
Hello.

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,519
This is Mrs. Ouyang.

20
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,280
Nice to meet you.

21
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,039
Sorry.

22
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,719
My wife is unable to speak.

23
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,639
(I'm sorry, Ms. Zhou Yunong.)

24
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,840
(Please allow me
to talk with you in this way.)

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,719
But she wanted

26
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,759
to extend our hospitality

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,120
and welcome you.

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,319
What a pity.

29
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,360
Not really.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,159
My wife may not be able to speak,

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,199
but it doesn't
affect my feelings for her.

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,960
To be honest,

33
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,280
I wasn't

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,520
planning to come.

35
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,759
After all, your husband didn't have

36
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,280
the basic etiquette to do a handshake

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,039
during our brief acquaintance.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,719
(You got him wrong.)

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,319
(He didn't shake hands with you)

40
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,759
(due to the allergic reaction
on his hands.)

41
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,400
Mr. Shen.

42
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,199
I'm curious how you two met.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,599
(Let me answer.)

44
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,560
(Translate for me.)

45
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,039
My wife thinks I'm bad with words

46
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,840
and asks me to be

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,960
her translator.

48
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,000
She said that

49
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,639
she met me during our college years.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,560
I was the most handsome guy
in our department.

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,159
The first time she saw me,

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,560
she was attracted by my looks.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,919
Then things slowly got out of control.

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,199
So, how did you two become a couple?

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,479
We were brought together

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,360
by fate and my grandma.

57
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,520
During college,

58
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,719
Qinian volunteered at a special school.

59
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,680
And it happened

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,800
to be founded by my grandma.

61
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,280
My grandma knew she liked me

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,680
and thus brought us together.

63
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,159
After that,

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
we fell in love

65
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,919
and got married.

66
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,599
That's right.

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,319
You should pursue the person you like.

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,080
Yeah.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,000
In that sense,

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,400
I am the same as you.

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,919
We should bravely express our feelings.

72
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,719
If the other person feels the same way,

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,159
then lovers will become spouses.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,720
Okay.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,800
I propose

76
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,639
a toast

77
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,279
to our love.

78
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,279
To our love.

79
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,079
Cheers.

80
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Mrs. Ouyang.

81
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,639
My wife

82
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,040
doesn't drink much.

83
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,600
Please don't get her drunk.

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,639
Mr. Shen.

85
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,319
You dote on your wife too much.

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,879
Miss Song seems to be quite easygoing.

87
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,120
Isn't it charming for her to get tipsy

88
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,439
in front of you sometimes?

89
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,079
Come on.

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,319
Come on, cheers.

91
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,600
(It's late. I'll go back to my room.)

92
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,879
Song Qinian.

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,399
Come here.

94
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,759
(Didn't I do well today?)

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,240
You did very well.

96
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,839
So well that I thought you were lying.

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
(About what?)

98
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,600
You said that you had a crush on me

99
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,399
in college.

100
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Is that true?

101
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,199
(It doesn't matter anymore.)

102
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,160
It does.

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,839
Answer me.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
(Yeah.)

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,319
(I once had a crush on you.)

106
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,839

Be right there.

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
(It turns out)

124
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,639
(it was just)

125
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,720
(an accident last night.)

126
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,919
Qiutong.

127
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,919
Chiyan.

128
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,960
I can stand up now.

129
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,759
Be careful.

130
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,639
I'll help you.

131
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,559
No need.

132
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,080
I can go to you.

133
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,240
Qiutong.

134
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,480
It's okay.

135
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,080
Sit.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Chiyan.

137
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I don't want to
go back to that bed again.

138
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,000
Never.

139
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,440
Chiyan.

140
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,960
Do you despise me when I'm like this?

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,919
Qiutong.

142
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,360
What are you saying?

143
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
Chiyan.

144
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,159
I don't want you to pity me.

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,759
I said I would wait for you.

146
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,600
But why have you never said

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,799
you would marry me?

148
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,840
Qiutong.

149
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,039
I will not despise...

150
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,320
Chiyan, stop.

151
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,360
Listen to me first.

152
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,799
Or I may never
have the chance to tell you.

153
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,639
Chiyan.

154
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,919
Okay, go ahead.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,039
I'm so jealous of Song Qinian.

156
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I can't stand the way I am now.

157
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,360
On the one hand, I'm jealous.

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,120
On the other hand, I'm begging

159
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,600
for your love.

160
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,720
Chiyan, would you divorce her for me?

161
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,399
I can't hurt her anymore.

162
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,039
Chiyan.

163
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,279
Qiutong.

164
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,759
Chiyan, don't push me away.

165
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,360
Please, Chiyan.

166
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,519
Just this once.

167
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,720
Chiyan.

168
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,000
I love you.

169
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,679
Can you hold me?

170
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,519
Hold me, Chiyan.

171
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,679
Chiyan, hold me.

172
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,440
Hold me tight.

173
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,200
Qiutong.

174
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,639
Let's talk, shall we?

175
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,000
Come on.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,799
Chiyan.

177
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,559
Do you remember this?

178
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,879
There's a pair of them.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,919
Mine is engraved with a Y.

180
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,440
Yours is engraved with a Q.

181
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,360
You told me when you gave it to me

182
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,519
that you'd protect me for life.

183
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,080
(No matter where you are,)

184
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,960
(as long as you blow this,)

185
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,039
(I'll show up by your side.)

186
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,440
Chiyan.

187
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,799
It's the same for me.

188
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,879
I'd also protect you for life.

189
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,279
So I have never regretted saving you.

190
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,159
Even if

191
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,279
you have forgotten our promise.

192
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
