(It's Qinian's Turn to Have Amnesia)

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Try the coffee I made myself.

4
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,479
You made it?

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,079
Tasty.

6
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,079
You were not interested
in flower arranging.

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,959
Now I think

8
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,400
that completing a piece of work
according to my desire

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
is a very interesting thing.

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,519
But what if the work fails?

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,680
Will you still like it?

12
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Qiutong,

13
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,599
you remember when we were kids?

14
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,319
Only you noticed me
hiding in the corner.

15
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,319
If it weren't for Shen Chiyan,

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,879
we might have a different story.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
It's not too late to start now.

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,280
Qiwen.

19
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,439
I need you.

20
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,360
Song Qinian is pregnant.

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,280
I can't let her

22
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,680
keep this kid.

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
As long as you want,

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,960
I'll do anything,

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,800
my princess.

26
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,360
Qinian,

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,560
I brought you bird's nest soup.

28
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,879
You can leave after that.

29
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,080
Qinian,

30
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm here.

31
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,400
No need to look at photos

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,439
and miss me.

33
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,560
So brazen.

34
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,879
Qinian.

35
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,520
Sit.

36
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,400
Qinian.

37
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:22,879
Qinian.

38
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,560
Qinian.

39
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,360
From this moment on,

40
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,560
I'll be a good husband

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,040
and a good father.

42
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,240
Can you trust me once again?

43
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
You don't have to take
responsibility for the kid.

44
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,519
Your grandma won't give up on you
because of me and the kid.

45
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,639
You can treat me like before,

46
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,040
just as your secretary.

47
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you really think so?

48
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,439
Then, the Ouyangs' party

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,959
in a few days,

50
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,759
will you attend as my wife

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,279
or my secretary?

52
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,680
You and the baby get some rest.

53
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,199
I'll wait for you to come back to me.

54
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,199
(I'll spend the rest of my life)

55
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,199
(to make up for the three years)

56
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,439
(and prove my love for you.)

57
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,839
Welcome, welcome.

58
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,040
Qinian, long time no see.

59
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,720
Happy wedding anniversary.

60
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
Qinian, your voice is so pleasant.

61
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,560
Thanks to that doctor.

62
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
We are very glad

63
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,560
that we helped you.

64
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,959
Come on, have a chat with me.

65
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,680
Okay.

66
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,519
How have you been?

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,519
Dealing with matters abroad.

68
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,600
Thanks for your help.

69
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Young man,

70
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,199
it's good to be young and promising.

71
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,040
Thank you.

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,839
Long time no see.

73
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,600
Mr. Ouyang.

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,399
Long time no see.

75
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,000
It's been long.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,199
Let me introduce you two.

77
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,199
James,

78
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,399
my friend from abroad,

79
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,720
Shen Qiwen.

80
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,279
This is...

81
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,360
Mr. Shen is my brother.

82
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,199
You're brothers?

83
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,519
Yes.

84
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,199
Really?

85
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,839
Coming.

86
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,600
You guys talk.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
Please excuse me.

88
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,920
Shen Qiwen,

89
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,560
what are you doing here?

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Because you're here,

91
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,600
I can't come?

92
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,399
Stop being domineering
as you were before.

93
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,079
I'm warning you.

94
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,439
Don't play tricks.

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,160
Here you go again.

96
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,600
Is that funny?

97
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,240
Enjoy yourself.

98
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay.

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Qinian.

100
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,040
I heard you and Shen Chiyan are going
to file for divorce.

101
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,199
Is that true?

102
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,879
Sorry,

103
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm his younger brother,

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,399
Shen Qiwen.

105
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,720
I know you.

106
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,240
Your surgery was quite successful.

107
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,399
I can't see the scar at all.

108
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,800
Even a mute can speak now.

109
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,240
Yours is successful too.

110
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,399
You married Chiyan
because you slept with him.

111
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,560
So, Song Qinian.

112
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,000
You've given me many surprises.

113
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,040
You said Chiyan is your brother?

114
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,759
We've been married for three years.

115
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,959
I've never heard them mention you.

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,920
I'm just an illegitimate child.

117
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,079
What's there to mention?

118
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,480
Don't go, Qinian.

119
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,519
I haven't finished yet.

120
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,120
You used your body
to climb all the way up.

121
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm an illegitimate child
no one cares about.

122
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,399
Don't you think we're a good match?

123
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,680
Let go of me!

124
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,680
What happened?

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
That scared me.

126
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,560
Who is that?

127
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Who is she?

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
What's going on?

129
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,080
Who is that?

130
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,879
Oh my.

131
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,879
She's bleeding.

132
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,559
Qinian.

133
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,360
Qinian!

134
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,360
Move.

135
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,240
Move.

136
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,120
Call an ambulance.

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,360
Call an ambulance!

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,279
Call an ambulance!

139
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,159
Save the baby.

140
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,799
It's alright.

141
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,759
It's alright.

142
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,639
Qinian.

143
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,919
I'm here.

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,879
Why so much blood?

145
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:02,752
(Jianghai Zhuoai Hospital)

146
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Qinian.

147
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,799
Qinian.

148
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,879
Qinian.

149
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,039
You can have a child again.

150
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,320
The most important thing
is that you are okay.

151
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,000
Child?

152
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,320
What child?

153
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,399
Qinian.

154
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,559
What's wrong?

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,799
Honey,
