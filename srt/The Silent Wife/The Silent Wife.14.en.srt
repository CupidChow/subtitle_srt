(Song Qinian Hit Me!)

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,399
Guanliang.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,920
How could you
bear to abandon me and Qinian?

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,920
(Tomb of Song Guanliang)
How can I live without you?

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,680
Qinian.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
How could your dad
just leave us like this?

8
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,920
(Mom.)

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,719
(Let Dad rest in peace.)

10
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,719
(We must live on.)

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,680
(Dad.)

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,120
(Rest assured.)

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,319
(Those who hurt you)

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,000
(will have to pay. I promise.)

15
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,439
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
You're not welcome.

17
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,000
Get lost.

18
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,159
Who wants to visit this dreadful place?

19
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,799
My sister said Song Qinian's dad...

20
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,400
Lanxing.

21
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,879
Song Qinian.

22
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,480
Chiyan told me that

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,920
your dad had passed away.

24
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,840
The deceased deserves respect

25
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,120
no matter what.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,599
My condolences.

27
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,199
Respect?

28
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,840
He was in jail
for three years because of you.

29
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,240
Now he's gone.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,000
You didn't come to mourn.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,520
You came to cheer, didn't you?

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,400
Nonsense!

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,639
You're not welcome.

34
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,479
Get lost.

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,400
Song Qinian's dad kidnapped my sister.

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,840
Qiutong was in a coma
for three years because of him.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,719
She came with all good intentions
to show respect.

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
Who are you to drive us away?

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,240
You...

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,039
Qinian, do you hear what she's saying?

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Song Qinian.

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,639
Stay calm.

43
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,800
Chiyan.

44
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,280
It seems we're not welcome here.

45
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,919
We're leaving.

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,039
Lanxing.

47
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,919
Everyone in that family is the same.

48
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,120
What a jinx.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,639
How dare you hit me?

50
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,039
Song Qinian, did you lose it?

51
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,240
Apologize to Lanxing.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,039
Qiutong.

53
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,000
Song Qinian.

54
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,199
I know you're upset.

55
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,960
But you're a bit...

56
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,120
Song Qinian, are you crazy?

57
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,719
Come at me if you want.

58
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,840
Take them...

59
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,919
Take them and leave.

60
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,840
Get lost.

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,000
Who cares to be here?

62
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,240
Qiutong, let's go.

63
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:13,152
(Tomb of Beloved Father Song Guanliang)

64
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,600
Chiyan.

65
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,879
Here's the footage from Mr. Song's ward.

66
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,759
It might be too much for Qinian.

67
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,879
So I didn't show her.

68
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,399
Take a look.

69
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,600
(I didn't expect you to be
even more naive than your daughter.)

70
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,920
(She lied to you.)

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,480
(I'm here to tell you)

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,839
(what happened back then.)

73
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,480
(Chiyan and I have been
childhood sweethearts.)

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,199
(If Song Qinian hadn't
shamelessly seduced Chiyan,)

75
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,279
(I wouldn't have staged
that kidnapping drama by myself)

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,079
(which led to your separation.)

77
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,920
(All the...)

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,879
This is who Lin Qiutong really is.

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,680
Now you see it, huh?

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,800
(And I was the victim.)

81
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:29,088
(Qiutong)

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,879
And she's shameless enough to call you.

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,279
Hello.

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
I want to talk to you, anyway.

85
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,519
Okay.

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,959
See you at the bridal shop.

87
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,759
Chiyan.

88
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,240
Please.

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,720
Stop hurting my sister-in-law.

90
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,000
Qiutong, you're so beautiful.

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,120
I guarantee

92
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,879
Chiyan will be stunned

93
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,560
when he sees you.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
I hope he will like it.

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,839
Of course, he will.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
You have a unique taste.

97
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,439
Besides,

98
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,759
the shop assistant said

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,759
that it was the one and only
limited edition

100
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,680
that had just been air-shipped.

101
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,639
Only a princess like you

102
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,199
can pull it off.

103
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,879
Not all princesses

104
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,839
in the fairy tales can become queens.

105
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,160
Am I right?

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,560
Yeah, indeed.

107
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,480
You look

108
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,160
like a real queen.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,079
The waistline

110
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,439
can be even smaller.

111
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,160
I'll be even slimmer

112
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,519
on my wedding day.

113
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,759
Okay.

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,600
Song Qinian.

115
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,079
Why are you here?

116
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,560
Why...

117
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,279
Why are you dressed like that?

118
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,199
Lanxing.

119
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,319
Don't you remember

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,279
that she can't talk?

121
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,480
I almost forgot.

122
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,279
She can't talk.

123
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,199
She could only babble "aba aba".

124
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,480
We can't understand anything.

125
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,720
Song Qinian.

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,240
You've never

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
worn a wedding dress, have you?

128
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,000
Because Chiyan

129
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,680
has never seen you

130
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,240
as his wife.

131
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,399
So you never held a wedding.

132
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,319
Song Qinian.

133
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
My sister is talking to you.

134
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,800
I know you can't speak.

135
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,000
But are you also deaf?

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,720
There you are, Chiyan.

137
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,639
Lin Qiutong.

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,319
Look at Song Qinian.

139
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,480
She's dressed like that

140
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
just to curse me.

141
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,519
Lin Qiutong.

142
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,440
Shut up, you wretch.

143
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,759
(S-She can talk now?)

144
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,120
What did you say?

145
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,840
You...

146
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
You can talk now?

147
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,919
You stole my things

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
and used my blood.

149
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,360
You went through

150
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,200
so much trouble to get him, didn't you?

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,519
You can have him.

152
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,799
I don't need him anyway.

153
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,759
Oh right.

154
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,039
This is for you.

155
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
Surprise.

156
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,159
No.

157
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,840
No.

158
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
No way.

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
You can't be carrying Chiyan's child.

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
You...

161
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,879
You and Chiyan...

162
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,919
How can you do this to me?

163
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
So?

164
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,000
Aren't you surprised?

165
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,159
Aba.

166
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,440
Aba.

167
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,919
I will make you pay

168
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
for all your sins,

169
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,639
including my father's death.

170
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,159
No way.

171
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,639
Don't you have anything to say?

172
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,039
I want a divorce.

173
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
No way.

174
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,840
Chiyan.

175
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
It can't be real.

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
She fabricated it.

177
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,840
She wanted us to break up.

178
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,919
So she fabricated it.

179
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,159
Don't be fooled.

180
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,360
Yeah.

181
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,399
Chiyan.

182
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,679
Song Qinian is the worst liar.

183
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,840
Lin Qiutong.

184
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,240
I never said I'd marry you.

185
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
And I'm already married to Song Qinian.

186
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,799
Qiutong.

187
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,120
No, Chiyan.

188
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,679
It shouldn't be like this.

189
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,000
Also,

190
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,840
Song Guanliang died because of you.

191
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,559
There was surveillance.

192
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,840
So stop lying.
