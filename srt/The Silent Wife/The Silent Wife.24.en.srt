(I Will Protect You Forever)

3
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,319
Chiyan.

4
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,280
You finally woke up.

5
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
Does it still hurt?

6
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,439
Are you thirsty?

7
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,159
I'll get you...

8
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,920
Qinian.

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,120
Don't leave me.

10
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,760
I'm not going anywhere.

11
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,760
You're still smiling?

12
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm smiling because I'm so lucky.

13
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,640
I've survived both

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,920
the car accident

15
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,879
and the stabbing.

16
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,760
You're quite proud, huh?

17
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,719
Qinian.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,280
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,680
I lost my memory three years ago.

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,919
I thought I liked Lin Qiutong.

21
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,479
So I tormented you for three years.

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,719
That's enough.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Let's just make the best
of our future together.

24
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,520
Okay, I promise

25
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,159
I will never bring it up again.

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,439
So,

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,879
the one you've loved

28
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,360
has always been me.

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,439
Right?

30
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,159
Yeah.

31
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,479
I've only loved you

32
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,520
throughout my life.

33
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,680
Shen Chiyan.

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,280
I love you.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,319
Qinian.

36
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,719
I love you too.

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,759
Mr. Guan.

38
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,240
Li Nanxun.

39
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
When did you come?

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,240
You scared me.

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,319
We arrived around the same time.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
It's just that you couldn't see me.

43
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,439
Mr. Guan.

44
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,560
They've been through life and death.

45
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,080
You had no chance before

46
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,840
and you never will.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Let it go.

48
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,520
Forget about the chances.

49
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,439
I'm happy as long as

50
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,840
Qinian is happy.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
Magnanimous.

52
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,400
Of course.

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,919
I can basically

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,719
get any woman I like.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,879
Where did he go?

56
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,839
So elusive.

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
(Tomb of Song Guanliang)
Dad.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,319
You never bought a good drink

59
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,639
even though you loved drinking.

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,079
I will let you drink today.

61
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,319
I will drink with you.

62
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,279
Dad.

63
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,839
I can speak now.

64
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,160
It's a pity that you can't hear me.

65
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,360
Shen Qiwen and Lin Qiutong

66
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,040
have paid the price for their crimes.

67
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,839
They're in jail now.

68
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,319
Dad.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,560
I have finally cleared your name.

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
And there's more good news.

71
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,959
I am going to marry Chiyan.

72
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,240
You can rest assured.

73
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,000
We will only get better and better.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,920
Chiyan.

75
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,000
I miss my dad.

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,839
(Song Qinian.)

77
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,199
I like you.

78
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,319
I knew I wouldn't be lonely anymore

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,160
the moment I saw you.

80
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,959
(From the first time I saw you,)

81
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,439
(you have taken over
every corner of my life.)

82
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,959
(I care about every move you make)

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
(and every look you cast my way.)

84
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,399
(How lucky am I?)

85
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,160
(I found our unique connection)

86
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,920
(and made the whistle speak for you.)

87
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,279
(Three years ago,)

88
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
(I was eager to confess to you)

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,959
(with your favorite
baby's breath in hand.)

90
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,720
(But I lost the memories of you.)

91
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,959
(Due to the misunderstanding)

92
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,439
(about your father,)

93
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,040
(I've often neglected you
and even hurt you)

94
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,079
(in the past three years.)

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,279
(What I did to you put me in deep pain.)

96
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,839
(I didn't understand
why it was like that.)

97
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,680
(Until I realized)

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,040
(that it was my instinct)

99
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
(to love you
even when I lost my memories.)

100
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,720
(Slowly,)

101
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,920
(I began to realize
that I couldn't live without you.)

102
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,839
(Although you couldn't speak,)

103
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,720
(it was okay.)

104
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,519
I will be your voice.

105
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,279

What do you want to say?

109
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,720
