=Episode 19=
(She's Not My Secretary, But My Wife)

3
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,560
Grandma.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Qinian.

5
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,679
Grandma, how are you doing?

6
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,439
Come here.

7
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,760
Grandma,

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
if you feel unwell,
we'll go to the hospital now.

9
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,680
Qinian.

10
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,959
You can speak now?

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
Since when?

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,680
Not long ago.

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,599
Grandma,

14
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,079
where do you feel uncomfortable?

15
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,959
How's your health?

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,239
I'm in good health.

17
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,959
If I hadn't said so,

18
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,400
would you have come to see me?

19
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,519
I just miss you.

20
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,239
Really?

21
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,680
You scared me.

22
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,519
He is...

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Chiyan?

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,159
Grandma,

25
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,519
what are you talking about?

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,719
This is my husband, Guan Mingxu.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,920
Just call me Mingxu.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,079
Mingxu?

30
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,760
Did I remember the name wrong?

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
It's all your fault.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,079
It's been three years

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
and you haven't come to see me.

34
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,079
I've even forgotten his name.

35
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes,

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
it's my fault.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,319
Don't worry.

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,439
Qinian and I

39
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,599
will come to visit you often.

40
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,520
You didn't tell me you were coming back.

41
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
I haven't prepared anything.

42
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,879
I'll go make some noodles for you.

43
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,319
Grandma, no need for that.

44
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,800
We'll go inside and rest for a bit.

45
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,639
Just take a rest.

46
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,639
You guys rest early, okay?

47
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,439
Okay.

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,639
Let's go.

49
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,159
Why do I remember Qinian's husband

50
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,879
is called Shen Chiyan?

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
Shen,

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,719
you called us over.

53
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,039
What is it for?

54
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,479
You're

55
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,879
too young.

56
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,039
Mr. Shen has always handled
the company's affairs well.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Everyone knows

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,319
Mr. Shen was cultivated by Madam Shen.

59
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,439
Now you stand out.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
You're making it difficult for us.

61
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
I don't really mind.

62
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,479
It doesn't matter who is the president.

63
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,639
What matters is

64
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,120
to ensure the interests of us directors.

65
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,439
Are you threatening me?

66
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,520
Mr. Zhao.

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
If your wife

68
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,719
suddenly finds out you have
several mistresses

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,039
and three illegitimate children,

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
then the drama in your family

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,159
will be far more interesting.

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,319
Mr. Qian.

73
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,719
I've always respected you.

74
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,879
But your son has got a lot of nerve.

75
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,120
He misappropriated eight million
from the subsidiary's funds

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,159
and lost all of it.

77
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,319
Money is nothing,

78
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,000
but he is what matters.

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

80
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,280
Mr. Sun.

81
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,160
I have something to show you.

82
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,399
How did you do that?

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,120
Even Mr. Shen didn't secure

84
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,680
this international order.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
It could make a profit
of hundreds of millions.

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,360
I've already shown my sincerity to you.

87
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,399
But I don't have much patience.

88
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,120
Tonight,

89
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,839
please give me your answers.

90
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,600
I really didn't see this coming.

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,639
Look what he did.

92
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,319
It's him then.

93
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
The meal's ready.

94
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,800
You've finally arrived.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,079
Come over here, Chiyan.

96
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,920
Let's eat together.

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,759
Okay.

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
There're not many dishes.

99
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,240
I'm not sure if they suit your taste.

100
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,600
Don't say that.

101
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,000
It's appetizing.

102
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,759
Sit.

103
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,120
Well,

104
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
sir,

105
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,199
you couldn't have come

106
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,160
all this way

107
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,120
just for a free meal.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,600
I invited Chiyan

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,639
to help our village sell wine.

110
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,040
Right, Chiyan?

111
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,199
Yes.

112
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm here to help sell wine.

113
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,920
Grandma,

114
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,279
when did you get to know him?

115
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,879
As I see,

116
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,399
he's just a swindler.

117
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,079
Well, sir...

118
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,920
Qinian.

119
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,480
I forgot to tell you.

120
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,000
He's my new assistant.

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,199
Right, Chiyan?

122
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,079
Your assistant?

123
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
Yes.

124
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,480
Mr. Guan.

125
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,240
Chiyan,

126
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,680
I can sell the wine by myself.

127
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,600
You can go back first.

128
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,639
Mr. Guan,

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
you can't handle it alone.

130
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,519
What can you do if you stay?

131
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,959
I can drink with you.

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,720
Fine.

133
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,199
I can hold my liquor.

134
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,639
Mingxu,

135
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,360
you can't drink so much of this.

136
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,759
Stop it.

137
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,879
Mingxu, take it easy.

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
Why are you competing with him?

139
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't just drink.

140
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,040
It'll hurt the stomach.

141
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,160
Have some food.

142
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,920
Easy.

143
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,120
Chiyan,

144
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,160
I heard you had your secretary drink
on behalf of you.

145
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,720
Don't try to act tough.

146
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
She's not my secretary,

147
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,279
but my wife.

148
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Ex-wife, actually.

149
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,519
I'm telling you.

150
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,959
We're not divorced yet.

151
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,279
All gibberish.

152
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,000
Mingxu,

153
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,959
are you alright?

154
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,000
Pass out now.

155
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,040
Lie on the table.

156
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,720
It's alright.

157
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,360
Qinian.

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,199
Look,

159
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,839
Chiyan is drunk.

160
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,120
Mr. Shen.

161
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,240
Mr. Shen.

162
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,759
If you can't drink, then don't.

163
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,639
You made Mingxu drunk too.

164
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,759
Mingxu,

165
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,799
let's go inside.

166
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,519
Let's go.

167
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,480
Take it slow.

168
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't go.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,080
Let go!

170
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,039
You really don't want me?

171
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,080
It was all my fault before.

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,399
I love you only now.

173
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,639
Don't leave me.

174
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,240
You're drunk.

175
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,360
I'll prepare some sobering soup for you.

176
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,519
I'm alright.

177
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,440
If I hadn't called you to come,

178
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,919
you wouldn't have come to see me, right?

179
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,480
Tell me,

180
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,480
what's the deal
with Qinian's miscarriage?

181
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,399
It had nothing to do with me.

182
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,000
Grandma,

183
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,679
sit down.

184
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
I hate Shen Chiyan

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,600
and don't like Song Qinian.

186
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,519
But the child is innocent.

187
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,960
How can I bear

188
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,320
to harm an unborn child?

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,279
What would I gain?

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
To get beaten up by Chiyan?

191
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:30,960
Grandma,

192
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
all these years,

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,759
have you ever considered me your family?

194
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,759
Have you, for even a second,

195
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,960
considered me as your grandson?

196
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,840
If I didn't treat you as my grandson,

197
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,720
why would I have let you in the company?

198
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,039
That's because you pitied me.

199
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,919
But what I need the least is pity.

200
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,360
So that's what you think of me?

201
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,519
Qiwen, please don't say that.

202
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,600
Grandma,

203
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,639
ever since I was a kid,

204
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,000
I've always longed for you
to care about me,

205
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,200
pay attention to me,

206
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,919
and feel even a little proud of me.

207
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,879
But you didn't.

208
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,000
You could only see Shen Chiyan,

209
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,600
Shen Chiyan,

210
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,440
Shen Chiyan.

211
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,720
What about me?

212
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,840
Where am I?

213
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,720
So,

214
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,360
you caused so much trouble
in the company

215
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,879
all because of that?

216
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,600
Stop it.

217
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
You can't beat Chiyan.

218
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
Grandma,

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,519
if you step in to help him,

220
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,080
then you'll only have one grandson.

221
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,080
You...

222
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,440
Hold on.

223
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,559
I won't interfere anymore.
