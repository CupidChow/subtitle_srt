=Episode 11=
(Rush to Get a Taste of the Beauty)

3
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,280
Shall we continue?

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,359
No, thanks.

5
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,439
I got things to do.

6
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,840
(Qinian shared a location)
(Shen Chiyan, help!)

7
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,680
Qinian is in trouble.

8
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,079
What happened?

9
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,079
Make yourself clear.

10
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,640
Boss.

11
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,239
I've got you the girl.

12
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,079
Look.

13
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,519
(Who is he?)

14
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
(What does he want?)

15
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,120
What a beauty.

16
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,200
Do you remember me?

17
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,760
How should I torture you

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,640
to make this more interesting?

19
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,079
Any suggestions?

20
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,319
It would be a pity

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
if I rushed to get a taste

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,120
of your beauty.

23
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,039
I must take my time to savor you.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,120
If all the women were mute

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
just like you,

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
wouldn't that be easier?

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
(Shen Chiyan.)

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,039
(Where are you?)

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,000
Someone has a death wish.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
(Qinian.)

31
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,560
(You finally came.)

32
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,719
(Sorry, I'm late.)

33
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,639
How did it go?

34
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,960
I failed the task, sir.

35
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,159
Sorry, sir.

36
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,080
Useless.

37
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,199
You failed such an easy task.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,439
Don't come back again.

39
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,680
Why didn't you dodge?

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,199
I deserve punishment

41
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,519
for failing.

42
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,800
Does it hurt?

43
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,399
How did it go?

44
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,319
Rest assured.

45
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
They can't trace us.

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
No wonder...

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
No wonder he didn't come last night.

48
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,680
I was naive, after all.

49
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,160
I underestimated that mute.

50
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,879
I almost forgot

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,800
how she made Chiyan
fall for her step by step.

52
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,759
He still cares so much about her!

53
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,240
Qiutong.

54
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,879
You're still recovering.

55
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,079
Don't catch a cold.

56
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,680
Qiwen.

57
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,680
My heart is broken.

58
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,600
I must convince Chiyan

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,199
that I am the one he loves

60
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,319
and not that worthless mute.

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Qiutong.

62
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,879
Even though Shen Chiyan

63
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,240
breaks your heart,

64
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,839
you still want him?

65
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Of course.

66
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,839
I've suffered so much

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,279
and waited so long.

68
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,519
I only want Chiyan.

69
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,720
There must be a way.

70
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,439
Let me think.

71
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,839
There must be a way.

72
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,000
Qinian.

73
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,040
You paint baby's breath so well.

74
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,680
What's wrong?

75
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,759
(Qiutong, have you seen my whistle?)

76
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
(I think it was on the drawing board.)

77
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,120
No, I didn't see it.

78
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,439
Why don't you look around?

79
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
(With this in hand,)

80
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,639
(I can be Song Qinian.)

81
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Qiwen.

82
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,120
I know what to do now.

83
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
(I'm sure that
I'm in love with Qiutong.)

84
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,480
(Lin Qiutong did save you,)

85
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,079
(but you didn't love her.)

86
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,680
(Don't get confused.)

87
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,879
(Qinian is your wife.)

88
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,720
(Know your place.)

89
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,159
(I was the one who saved you.)

90
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,120
- Chiyan.
- Chiyan.

91
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,480
- There you are.
- There you are.

92
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,759
It's the same dream again.

93
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,559
Baby's breath.

94
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,159
Whistle.

95
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,559
Whistle?

96
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
I've seen this whistle somewhere.

97
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,000
Qinian.

98
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,639
Miss Song.

99
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,159
I've looked into it.

100
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,759
Your father's car did appear
at Warehouse No. 19.

101
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Then he drove

102
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,440
to an abandoned factory in the suburbs.

103
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,600
The police found a sack and a rope

104
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
in his trunk.

105
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,600
Most importantly,

106
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Lin Qiutong's DNA

107
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
was found on both items.

108
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,440
Also,

109
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,559
your father texted the Lins for ransom.

110
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,320
(He must have been framed.)

111
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,440
Calm down.

112
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,360
You said that

113
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,840
your dad only remembered
going for the freight. Right?

114
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,279
It shows that

115
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,840
he might have been drugged.

116
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
If someone did frame your father,

117
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,840
it couldn't be Lin Qiutong alone.

118
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,240
She definitely had a helper.

119
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,879
Rest assured.

120
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,480
I will find the clues.

121
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,519
By the way.

122
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,320
I heard Lin Qiutong had woken up.

123
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,279
You can look into it.

124
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,440
Remember.

125
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,480
Don't alarm them.

126
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,200
See you around.

127
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,399
Song Qinian.

128
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,360
Why didn't you tell me when you woke up?

129
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,039
Never mind.

130
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,799
Let's go home.

131
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Grandma is worried.

132
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,799
Qinian.

133
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,759
Come on.

134
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,519
Have some fish.

135
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,399
Grandma.

136
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
You're so partial.

137
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,240
I want some too.

138
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,279
Help yourself.

139
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,759
There's plenty.

140
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,279
I heard you were looking for a partner

141
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,759
to expand the overseas market.

142
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,720
That's the plan.

143
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Grandma.

144
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,399
I think

145
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,840
the Ouyang family of TD
is the best candidate.

146
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,240
We've had contact with them before.

147
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,399
Ouyang?

148
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,320
He's under his wife's thumb.

149
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,279
He listens to everything she says,

150
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,600
unlike someone I know.

151
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,600
Grandma.

152
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,919
I have met them at a dance party once.

153
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,399
They looked like a sweet couple.

154
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,200
But there was a problem.

155
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,240
Mr. Ouyang's wife
Zhou Yunong didn't like me.

156
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,960
You look unapproachable.

157
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,559
Who would like you?

158
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,600
I bet only

159
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,639
my sister-in-law can put up with you.

160
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,440
Right, Chiyan.

161
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,399
Why don't you

162
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,960
throw a party

163
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,799
and show them your love and sincerity?

164
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,919
Perhaps,

165
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,840
that will make you win them over
and have a deal.

166
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,399
That's it.

167
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,159
Meet up with them.

168
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,960
Bring Qinian along.

169
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,799
Only she can help you.

170
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,519
Qinian.

171
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,279
What do you say?

172
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,679
(Grandma, rest assured.)

173
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,399
(I will help Chiyan)

174
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,840
(to secure the collaboration
with Mr. and Mrs. Ouyang.)

175
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,679
Okay, come on, dig in.

176
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,320
Dig in.

177
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,000
Nanxun.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,480
Yeah?

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,039
Imagine if someone has amnesia

180
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,519
or a partial memory loss...

181
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,759
Aren't you talking about yourself?

182
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,919
If we loved someone, would we still

183
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,039
like them after we lost memory?

184
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,720
I think

185
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,799
we would.

186
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,360
Because it's just a memory loss.

187
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,720
We're still who we are.

188
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,519
Even if the brain forgets,

189
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,879
the body doesn't.

190
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,240
I mean the heart.

191
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,159
The heart doesn't.

192
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,639
