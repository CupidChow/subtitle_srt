00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:45,490
=Episode 22=
(Die, Shen Chiyan!)

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,359
I'll call the police.
They will arrest you.

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,039
The truth?

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,200
Make yourself clear.

6
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,560
You have no idea.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Three years ago,

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,719
if Qiutong hadn't protected you,

9
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,799
I would have hit you with the car.

10
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,840
And Song Guanliang.

11
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,439
I just showed him
a video with a face swap.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,000
And he willingly
served three years in jail.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,760
Shen Qiwen.

14
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,296
What else do you wanna know?

15
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,400
I'll tell you all.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,680
Shen Qiwen.

17
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,560
Do you know what you're saying?

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,159
Shen Qiwen, are you crazy?

19
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,439
You idiot.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,959
(Three years ago)
Chiyan.

21
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,040
It's my birthday tomorrow.

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,000
You must come.

23
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,120
Tomorrow.

24
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,159
I'm afraid I can't.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Tomorrow,

26
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,159
I'm going to confess to Qinian.

27
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,000
I've waited for too long.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,760
I see.

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,159
Then

30
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,519
I wish you success.

31
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,319
Thank you.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,640
See you around.

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,640
Happy birthday.

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,719
Qiwen.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,759
I need you.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,879
I know Chiyan too well.

37
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,319
If he likes someone,

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,479
then it's for a lifetime.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
But why is he confessing

40
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,400
to that mute?

41
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,520
Qiwen.

42
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,960
You must stop him for me.

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,080
You will help me, right?

44
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,639
Yeah, I will.

45
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,439
Qiutong.

46
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,319
But even if Shen Chiyan

47
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,319
doesn't manage to confess this time,

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
what about

49
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,599
the next time?

50
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,360
What then?

51
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,319
Then let's make sure

52
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,039
that he despises Song Qinian
from now on.

53
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,520
You want to

54
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,319
ruin that mute's innocence.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,479
Song Qinian's father is a freight driver

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,680
who takes on private jobs

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
for a quick buck.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,479
What if he is in a hurry to make money

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,680
and ends up kidnapping me,
the young lady of the Lin family?

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,479
Qiutong.

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,919
Kidnapping is illegal.

62
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
He will be in jail.

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
That's right.

64
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,039
Song Guanliang will go to jail.

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,159
The reputation
of the Song family will be ruined.

66
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,800
I want her to look inferior

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,639
to Chiyan forever.

68
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,840
But what if he still

69
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,759
confesses his love?

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,639
Do you think the Shen family

71
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,000
would let him marry
the daughter of a kidnapper?

72
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,719
I see.

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,439
I'll work on it.

74
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,000
Qiutong.

75
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,479
No matter what happens,

76
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,479
I will be solely responsible.

77
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,520
Qiwen.

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,919
I won't let anything happen to you.

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,920
You're the one who matters.

80
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,480
That's right.

81
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,560
This is the place.

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,439
Where is the cargo?

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
There is a packed sack
to the left of the entrance.

84
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,560
It's so heavy.

85
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,600
What's inside?

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,399
I wouldn't take on this job

87
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,600
if not for the high payout.

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
Whatever.

89
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Let's be done with it.

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,519
Who are you?

91
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,600
Qiwen.

92
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,000
Tie me up now.

93
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,800
Hurry.

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,839
Qiutong.

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm tying a slip knot.

96
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,120
You can break free

97
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,120
with a little pull.

98
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,920
Qiwen.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
A text message isn't enough.

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,160
Take a photo

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
of me with his phone.

102
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,000
Now.

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,000
I have checked this place.

104
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,800
There's only one camera.

105
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
And it's broken.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,399
It's an abandoned factory.

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
There is

108
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
no one else here.

109
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,600
Where are you going?

110
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,959
I'm bringing the old man here

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,839
before he wakes up.

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,079
And you will

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,160
wait right here

114
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,600
for Shen Chiyan to come to your rescue.

115
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,480
What a lively night

116
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,720
you're having.

117
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,399
Song Qinian.

118
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,959
Miss Qiutong.

119
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,360
How does it feel to be bitten

120
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,560
by your pet?

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,360
You guys...

122
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,439
How come you guys...

123
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,079
Chiyan.

124
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,639
Everything

125
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,160
you said was a lie?

126
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
You've been lying to me?

127
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,240
What did he lie about?

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Besides,

129
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,360
so what if we deceived you?

130
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
What have you done?

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,519
One lie after another.

132
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,920
Aren't you tired?

133
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,560
When

134
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,519
did it all start?

135
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:40,050
(Three days ago)

136
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,560
Have the hangover soup

137
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,360
while it's warm.

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,199
You remember, right?

139
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm serious about us.

140
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,199
Please don't leave me.

141
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,399
I will compensate you.

142
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,920
The best compensation would be

143
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,560
for you to sign the divorce agreement

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,639
and disappear right away.

145
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,279
Qinian.

146
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,959
I remember now.

147
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,480
I remember everything.

148
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,840
Qinian.

149
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,080
Three years ago,

150
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,480
I fell in love with you
at first sight in college.

151
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,639
I wanted to meet you.

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
So I waited for you at the entrance

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,679
of your class

154
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,679
and bumped into you.

155
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,960
And I knew you couldn't speak.

156
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
So I learned sign language
from my grandma

157
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,759
just to communicate with you.

158
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,519
And I invited you

159
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,480
to the lighthouse

160
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,360
to confess my feelings to you.

161
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,679
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,720
I didn't make it that day

163
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,039
because I was in a car accident

164
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,720
and forgot everything about us.

165
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,440
I even forgot you.

166
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,080
I said I'd divorce you.

167
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,360
It's too late for you

168
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,440
to say this now.

169
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,679
Do you remember

170
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,840
this whistle?

171
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,879
I made you a promise.

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
No matter where I am...

173
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
As long as you blow this whistle,

174
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll show up by your side.

175
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,720
This is yours.

176
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
It's engraved with my name.

177
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,120
Mine is engraved with your name.

178
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,759
And this cell phone

179
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
has been inactive

180
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,120
because I didn't know the password.

181
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,600
But then I regained my memory

182
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,840
and turned it on.

183
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,440
The password is your birthday.

184
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,759
Qinian.

185
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,559
I know that no matter
what I say or do now

186
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,879
can't make up for the past.

187
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,200
But please.

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,159
Give me one more chance.

189
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,879
One last chance.

190
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,120
Let me love you once more.

191
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,759
Okay.

192
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,200
I'll give you a chance.

193
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,600
I need you

194
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,679
to put on a show for me

195
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,759
until Lin Qiutong
and Shen Qiwen reveal their true colors.

196
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,080
I want to hear them confess their crimes

197
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,799
and pay the price

198
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
for what they've done

199
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,200
to my father and me.

200
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,320
Okay.

201
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,360
You heard everything?

202
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,240
Actually, when you asked me

203
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,559
for help in the hospital,

204
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,679
I already saw this coming.

205
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,240
Qinian.

206
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,320
Do whatever you want to do.

207
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Just be happy.

208
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,720
We...

209
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,279
We...

210
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,759
are friends.

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,960
Aren't we?

212
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,320
Yeah.

213
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,360
Lin Qiutong.

214
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,879
You're so heartless.

215
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,039
For your pathetic infatuation,

216
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,080
you used Shen Qiwen
to ruin my life and Chiyan's.

217
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
You even killed my father.

218
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,879
I did all this.

219
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,279
Qiutong is innocent.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,919
Chiyan.

221
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,519
I have been by your side
for so many years.

222
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,879
I've given everything

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
just to be with you.

224
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,519
After so many years,

225
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,240
why can't I replace her

226
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,639
and win your heart?

227
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,360
Why?

228
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,200
Lin Qiutong.

229
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,799
Stop being so obsessed.

230
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,799
I think you are sick.

231
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,399
I'm not the one you need.

232
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,399
You need a psychiatrist.

233
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,879
I happen to know a good psychiatrist.

234
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,279
Should I pull some strings?

235
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,080
Don't talk to her like that!

236
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,440
Chiyan.

237
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
It's all because of you.

238
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,840
Die!

239
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,120
Die!

240
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,960
Chiyan!
