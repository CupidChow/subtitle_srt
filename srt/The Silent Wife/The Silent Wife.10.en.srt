00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,439
Qiutong, what's wrong?

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,679
Doctor.

6
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,079
It's urgent.

7
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,719
Get Dr. Pei to the VIP ward.

8
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,879
Miss Lin is in trouble.

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Hello, Lanxing.

10
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,920
Okay, I'm on my way.

11
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,519
Nanxun, go to the hospital.

12
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,000
Understood.

13
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,840
Miss Lin.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,439
Her condition has stabilized.

15
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,799
What happened?

Chiyan.

17

This is not Miss Song's fault.

18
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,120
She didn't know
I was allergic to peanuts.

19
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Qiutong.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,039
I don't care whether she knew about it.

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,159
She made you suffer,

22
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,240
after all.

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,280
Song Qinian.

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,240
You'd better apologize to my sister.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,240
Or I won't let you off.

26
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,639
Lanxing.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Don't be rude.

34

He'll bring it to you.

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,279

in the company.

109
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,920
Hasn't he been
studying design abroad these years?

110
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,839

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,879
Start work next Monday.

116
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,199
Also,

117
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,199
don't make trouble for me.

118
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Right.

119
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,439
I heard you've married a mute

120
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
in secret.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,879
Is that true?

122
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,079
What does it have to do with you?

123
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,759
What does it have to do with me?

124
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,279
Yeah, indeed.

125
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Your mute wife is none of my business.

126
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,840
But if she hurts Qiutong,

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,120
then

128
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
things would be serious.

129
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
My sister-in-law

130
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,120

131
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,039
