20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,760
I just want to see a peaceful world.

21
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,360
And may all citizens

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,199
get to enjoy the serenity.

00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,760
That's why

24
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,400
I aid Huang Chao.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,959
So what do you wish

26
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,559
to tell me then, Mr. Yu?

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,720
Since you already broached the topic,

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,399
I do have a few suggestions.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,279
Pray tell.

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,199
Whose horse carriage is outside?

31
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,759
It belongs to Prince Ju of Yongzhou.

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,479
He has been waiting for a while.

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,960
Has Mr. Yu Wuyuan returned?

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,160
I, Feng Ju of Yongzhou,

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,600
greet Mr. Yu.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
It's you, Prince Ju.

37
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,080
Greetings.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,759
You're too courteous, Mr. Yu.

39
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,720
I learned that you had come to Yongzhou,

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
so I came to visit you.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,919
New Year's Day is approaching.

42
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,880
I figured I would bring you
some festive gifts as well.

43
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,520
I've already had them
place the gifts in your room.

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
I appreciate the thought.

45
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,839
However, I am terribly tired today.

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,720
May I ask you to come again another day?

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,759
Mr. Yu...

48
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,839
Of course.

49
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,520
I'm sorry to bother you today.

50
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,080
I will come again another day.

51
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,199
See Prince Ju off.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,119
Please.

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,440
(A Serene Abode of Grace)

54
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,880
Yu Wuyuan behaves too arrogantly.

55
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,199
What do you know?

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,160
The Empyrean Yu family

57
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,960
is said
to be knowledgeable in all matters.

58
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,919
Even the heir of Lord of Jizhou,
Huang Chao,

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,839
regards him as One-line Tutor.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,919
Naturally,

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,399
we must lower ourselves
and be humble when we seek wisdom

62
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,559
from someone like him.

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,240
We'll just make a few more trips here

64
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,800
in the next few days.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,639
If we can secure his support,

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,520
Feng Lanxi won't pose any threat to us.

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,199
They have left.

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,279
The fish

69
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,880
has taken the bait.

70
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,399
You mean

71
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,520
Prince Ju of Yongzhou?

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,320
I've heard that he and Feng Lanxi

73
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,679
do not get along.

74
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,440
He is the perfect pawn

75
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,880
to use against Feng Lanxi.

76
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,639
We can even use this chance
to stir up civil unrest in Yongzhou.

77
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,440
Why not?

78
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,200
Why did you send him away then, Sir?

79
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,679
The longer the bait is placed,

80
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,519
the more anxious the fish gets.

81
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,720
The more I want to use him as my weapon,

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,079
the longer I must wait
before allying with him.

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I'm sure he'll come again

84
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,160
in the coming few days.

85
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,160
You deal with him.

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,304
(Stellar Talent)

87
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,359
Your Highness,
I've had them prepare the things.

88
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,239
Send some of the liquor from the palace

89
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
to the other residence as well.

90
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,679
They've already been sent.

91
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,679
Have Miss Huan assist me
in getting changed.

92
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,959
You will come with me to the palace.

93
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,399
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,160
Master.

95
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,693
(Blessing)

96
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,640
We brought

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,399
Han Pu here to celebrate
the New Year with us.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,799
(Room of Serenity)
We're finally all together again.

99
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,000
Today,

100
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,920
on behalf of all the disciples
of the Tianshuang Sect,

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,559
I wish you

102
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,519
good health, good blessings,

103
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,079
and success in martial arts,

104
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,399
and may all your wishes come true.

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,799
May all of you

106
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,079
find improvement and success
in your cultivation as well.

107
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,679
Thank you, Master.

108
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,040
Langhua, distribute the red packets.

109
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,760
All right.

110
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,239
One by one! Don't rush!

111
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,079
- Thank you, Master!
- Thank you, Master!

112
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,040
Here.

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
I wish everyone

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,720
peace and happiness on New Year's Eve.

115
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,480
We wish you peace and happiness, Master.

116
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,079
We wish you peace and happiness!

117
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,640
Cheers!

118
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,679
Happy New Year, Master.

119
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,559
- Happy New Year, Master.
- The same to you.

120
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,359
Happy New Year.

121
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,600
The fireworks!

122
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,920
Master, let's watch the fireworks.

123
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,359
Father.

124
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,920
- Come on.
- Let's go.

125
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Let's go.

126
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,839
We bid farewell to the old
and welcome the new.

127
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
May the New Year
bring bountiful harvests.

128
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,720
Such a joyful festive

129
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,640
is worthy of a nationwide celebration.

130
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,440
We will proceed with the Rite of Giving.

131
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,320
The princes shall present
their gifts to His Lordship.

132
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,799
Feng Chang, you have a leg injury.

133
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,040
You need not get up.

134
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,920
Thank you, Father.

135
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:11,079
I present my gift to you, Father.

136
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,119
I am untalented.

137
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,320
I acquired a little gift for you,

138
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,160
a naturally formed Qilin coral.

139
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,720
May the divine creature bless you

140
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,799
with good fortune

141
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,519
and our nation
with peace and prosperity.

142
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,480
You're thoughtful, Chang.

143
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,279
Give Prince Yongxin, Feng Chang,

144
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,600
ten jade beads,

145
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,079
10,000 taels of silver leaves,

146
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,040
and a mansion outside the capital,

147
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,959
along with ten servants.

148
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,799
Thank you, Father.

149
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,320
His Lordship bestowed Prince Chang
a mansion and servants.

150
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,799
Could it be...

151
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,119
Those are usually gifts

152
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,079
given to an idle prince.

153
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,920
His Lordship is telling us

154
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,279
that Prince Chang
will not be succeeding him.

155
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,440
I present my gift to you, Father.

156
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
The scroll I present to you

157
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,799
is a construction plan

158
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,480
for all the water channels
within Yongzhou's borders.

159
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,040
May

160
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,679
our military forces be strengthened
and our nation prosper.

161
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,399
Bring it to me.

162
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,239
Good. Very good.

163
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,119
Splendid.

164
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,040
You know my heart well, Prince Yongping.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,519
If this irrigation system
is implemented,

166
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,040
it will allow us
to resist enemy forces.

167
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,359
Not only that,

168
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:37,399
but it will benefit our people
and the future generations to come.

169
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,640
Reward Prince Yongping

170
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,399
with 10,000 taels of silver leaves,

171
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,920
and a pair of Sun and Moon Pearls.

172
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,600
Thank you, Father.

173
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Sun and Moon Pearls?

174
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,320
Those are traditionally
the most valuable gifts

175
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,600
given to a prince
before he is crowned the heir.

176
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,079
I present my gift to you, Father.

177
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,720
Chang presented a treasure.
Lanxi contributed to our nation.

178
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,880
But my gift

179
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,000
is for you, Father.

180
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,839
I know

181
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,559
you work hard day and night
for our people, Father.

182
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,040
You often go without rest.

183
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,239
This pillow

184
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,440
is made from 10,000-year-old agarwood
from Nanhai.

185
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,760
It can calm one's mind.

186
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,040
I've had the physician
include fragrance sachets

187
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
that can help soothe
your nerves for better sleep as well.

188
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,000
May you rest assured

189
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,799
and be free of worries, Father.

190
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,480
Good.

191
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,000
Ju has grown up.

192
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,480
He knows
to be considerate of his father now.

193
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,559
So long as the people of Yongzhou
can live in peace

194
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,959
and my sons can live in harmony,

195
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
I can truly

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,359
be free of worry.

197
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Reward Prince Ju

198
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
with 10,000 taels of silver leaves,

199
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,559
and a pair of Jade Ruyi.

200
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,679
You're all grown up now.

201
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,359
Don't wander around anymore.

202
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,039
Stay by my side

203
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,280
and share my burdens.

204
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,080
Thank you, Father.

205
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,799
I will make every effort

206
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,400
to assist you, Father.

207
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,919
His Lordship first gave
Prince Yongping those gifts

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,359
and then had Prince Ju
stay to assist him.

209
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
His Lordship's intentions...

210
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:12,332
(Jizhou)

211
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,400
Why isn't Grand Tutor Ran Bo

212
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,137
at tonight's banquet?

213
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,560
(Lord of Jizhou)
at tonight's banquet?

214
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,559
Father.

215
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,760
Grand Tutor Ran is up in his years.

216
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,159
His legs do not work
as well as they used to.

217
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,719
I will go to the palace gate and check.

218
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,880
All right.

219
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:40,440
Go on.

220
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,320
Your Highness.

221
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,799
The entire Ran residence
has been seized.

222
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,840
Please give the orders.

223
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,760
Grand Tutor Ran manages the censorate.

224
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,080
However, he has colluded
with other ministers

225
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,239
and attempted to frame me

226
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,599
time and time again.

227
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,000
There is no need

228
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,280
to keep him alive.

229
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,719
How will we explain it to His Lordship?

230
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,799
I will handle that.

231
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,359
Understood.

232
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,039
Father.

233
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,000
News came from outside the palace.

234
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,400
Grand Tutor Ran

235
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
has passed away.

236
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,520
What did you say?

237
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,280
Grand Tutor Ran was up in his years.

238
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,200
He did not make it through this winter.

239
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,479
I have ordered them

240
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,760
to handle the matters of his funeral.

241
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
Please do not worry, Father.

242
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,320
Your Lordship.

243
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,119
Grand Tutor Ran
was already 70 years old.

244
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,159
He devoted everything to Jizhou.

245
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,520
And now, he has passed away
all of a sudden.

246
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,559
It must be because he knows

247
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,479
there is no need for him
to worry about Jizhou any further.

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
Your Lordship,
this is a joyous occasion.

249
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,280
Official Wang is right.

250
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:15,039
Jizhou had always been
on Grand Tutor Ran's mind.

251
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,640
Now, he has passed on.

252
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,599
He must have left in peace
after seeing how Jizhou had prospered

253
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,119
under the rule

254
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,599
of Your Lordship
and your heir, Prince Huang Chao.

255
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,080
- Indeed.
- That is right.

256
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:26,640
Father.

257
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,919
Grand Tutor Ran
contributed significantly to our nation.

258
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,520
He is a true pillar of Jizhou.

259
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,159
Please grant him a posthumous title.

260
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
What do you think, Huang Chao?

261
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,359
Let us give him

262
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,880
the character "Qing".

263
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,719
Very well.

264
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,599
Let's go with that.

265
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,200
Yes, Father.

266
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,320
Let us have a toast to console

267
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Grand Tutor Ran's spirit in heaven.

268
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,440
I thank you on his behalf, Father.

269
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,520
- To Grand Tutor Ran.
- To Grand Tutor Ran.

270
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:22,133
(Youzhou)

271
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,000
Father.

272
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,479
I dedicate this
"Heavenly Garment" dance to you.

273
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,479
I wish you a blessed birthday.

274
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,479
May our nation be blessed
with auspiciousness and peace.

275
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,119
I appreciate your thoughtfulness, Chun.

276
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
Come to me.

277
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,919
Yes, Father.

278
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,200
Chun.

279
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,239
- Have a seat.
- Father.

280
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,400
Your dance demonstrates
the elegance of You.

281
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,200
Tell me what reward you would like.

282
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,039
I ask for no reward.
I only wish to please you, Father.

283
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,679
If I were to be wed next year,

284
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,239
I would not get to dance
for you anymore, Father.

285
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,679
Chun.

286
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,320
Although you are of marriageable age,

287
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,559
I cannot bear

288
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,159
to see you be wed to a faraway place.

289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
How about this?

290
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,239
I will tell all the states

291
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,400
that those who wish to marry you

292
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,400
will have to spend
a few more years in Youzhou.

293
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,640
Thank you, Father.

294
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:56,239
Father. Please.

295
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,039
Here.

296
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,200
Report!

297
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,880
It will be midnight soon, Your Lordship.

298
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,840
Please light the fireworks
to bid farewell to the year.

299
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,640
All right.

300
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Chun.

301
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,080
Welcome the New Year with me.

302
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,039
Yes, Father.

303
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,520
Sir.

304
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,960
Feng Ju is here again.

305
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,280
It's time.

306
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm sure you are aware

307
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,640
of the situation in Yongzhou.

308
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,080
My father is in his prime.

309
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,359
That is why

310
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
he has yet to name his heir.

311
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I have great ambitions.

312
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,119
So I wish to fight 
for the title of heir as well.

313
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,640
However,

314
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,840
Lanxi is calculative and cunning.

315
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,760
I have lost to him repeatedly.

316
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,679
That is why I wish

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,280
to seek your help.

318
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,919
I'm afraid you might not
be aware of this, Prince Ju.

319
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,719
The Yu family has rules.

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,159
We are not to participate
in succession wars.

321
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm afraid

322
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,760
I cannot be of help to you.

323
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,520
I apologize.

324
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,000
May I ask

325
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,239
another question?

326
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:33,799
Of course.

327
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,359
Right now,

328
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,840
my father wants to
strengthen our military power.

329
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,400
To do so, he needs sufficient funds.

330
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,479
I wish to help him.

331
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,719
So I thought I could investigate

332
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,200
and seize embezzled funds
and use that money

333
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,880
to fill the treasury.

334
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,799
What are your thoughts
on this matter, Mr. Yu?

335
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
It is a very good deed.

336
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,599
If you are able to accomplish this,

337
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
you will surely gain
your father's appreciation and favor.

338
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,919
However,

339
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,679
there is a tremendous obstacle in my way.

340
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,520
If I investigate corruption,

341
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,440
I might lose supporters in court.

342
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,840
They will think

343
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,760
that I sacrificed my partners

344
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,520
for personal gains.

345
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,799
So Your Highness
wishes to have the best of both worlds.

346
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,400
I have a plan

347
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,599
that will allow Your Highness
to keep your supporters safe

348
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,039
and get Feng Lanxi

349
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,000
into trouble.

350
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,280
Thank you very much, Mr. Yu.

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,559
Here.

352
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,400
- Thank you.
- Hold it well.

353
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:46,960
Don't mention it.

354
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,000
Slowly now.

355
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,799
Please maintain order.
There is enough for everyone.

356
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,239
Yongzhou is one
of the largest states in the world.

357
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,520
The capital of Yongzhou is bustling.

358
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,719
But to think there are still so many

359
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,960
who suffer in poverty.

360
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:02,559
There is no peace
to speak of in turmoil times.

361
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,000
Between the rise and fall,
the common folk are the ones who suffer.

362
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,520
Only in a peaceful world

363
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,079
can they truly live
without fear or worry.

364
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,479
Someone

365
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,359
will need to put an end
to these chaotic times.

366
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,319
Out of the way! Out of my way!

367
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,280
Back off!

368
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,280
Back off!

369
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
- Move!
- Back off!

370
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,640
Who is in charge here?

371
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,880
What do you want?

372
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,920
Fengxi.

373
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,920
Master.

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,839
Are you the person in charge here?

375
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,479
Yes.

376
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,319
I am Bai Jiande of the Tianshuang Sect.

377
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,119
We happened to be celebrating
the New Year here.

378
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,839
So we set up this shelter
to provide porridge and alms.

379
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,680
Who gave you permission to do that?

380
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,439
Did you notify the Ministry of Revenue?

381
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,319
It's a kind deed.

382
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,800
Why should we have to notify
the Ministry of Revenue?

383
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:41,760
Moreover,

384
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,439
I don't believe Yongzhou has a law

385
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,479
that states we must notify
the Ministry of Revenue of this.

386
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,040
These are our rules.

387
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,160
Unreasonable rules.

388
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,520
How are they unreasonable?

389
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,079
You want to distribute porridge.

390
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,640
When you do that,
the poor will gather in this area.

391
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,079
And all of those
who crowd this area are paupers!

392
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,839
If you want to distribute porridge,
go ahead.

393
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,599
But first, you must
give us 100 silver leaves.

394
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,520
100 silver leaves?

395
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,599
What? Can't afford it?

396
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,839
I'll tear this place down then!

397
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
Don't forget this, Sir.

398
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,079
You can abuse the common folk,

399
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,959
but heaven is watching.

400
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,319
Fine.

401
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,280
Men!

402
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:15,880
Stop!

403
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,959
I have Minister Feng's official plate
in my hands.

404
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,439
To see this plate is to see her.

405
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,239
Who is causing a ruckus?

406
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,359
Oh, you are one of Minister Feng's.

407
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,520
I am the subordinate of He Youde,
a censor of the Ministry of Revenue.

408
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,599
I handle the matters
of finance and food in the city.

409
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,920
Sir.

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,800
These unruly civilians
were gathering here.

411
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
That is why I came to discipline them.

412
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,160
Is that so?

413
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,560
But I only saw

414
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,119
an arrogant man

415
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,760
disturbing the common folk.

416
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,680
No, no.

417
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,160
I wouldn't dare.

418
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,400
I dare not, sir.

419
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,760
Distributing porridge on the first day
of the month is a good deed.

420
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,920
Yet, the Ministry of Revenue
wants to collect money for it?

421
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,199
Could it be that you are used
to enriching yourself

422
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,000
with illegally acquired funds
under the guise of official use?

423
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,640
The Ministry of Revenue
is under the jurisdiction of Prince Ju.

424
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,680
Could it be those who work for Prince Ju

425
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,199
are all the same as you?

426
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,640
I think it is time

427
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,239
for Minister Feng
to have a chat with Prince Ju.

428
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,880
It's a terrible misunderstanding.

429
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,439
I was blind and ignorant.

430
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,119
I have offended the heroes.

431
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,280
I hope you will

432
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,040
forgive me.

433
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,040
Get out of my sight!

434
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,760
Yes, sir. I will do so right away.

435
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,520
Right away.

436
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,599
Let's go!

437
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,800
- All right.
- Come over, everyone.

438
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,239
Come over.

439
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,000
Carry on.

440
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,160
Zhong Li.

441
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,680
Thank you for your help.

442
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:32,599
No need to thank me.

443
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,439
His Highness arranged all of this.

444
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:35,760
Black Foxy?

445
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:36,800
Where is he?

446
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,000
Please follow me.

447
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,439
Are you all right, Martial Sister?

448
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,199
I'm fine.

449
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,560
How was my acting, Your Highness?

450
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,359
It was all right.

451
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,040
At least you didn't disgrace me.

452
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,359
Thank you, Prince Yongping.

453
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,920
No need to thank me, Master Bai.

454
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,119
Why did you let them go, Your Highness?

455
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,839
They are only small fry.

456
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,479
If we are to correct this
once and for all,

457
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
we need to start with the higher-ups.

458
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,800
(I didn't know
she had such an idea as well.)

459
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,479
All right. Let's put this aside.

460
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,040
I'll help you distribute the porridge.

461
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,280
Let's go.

462
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,119
Three officials
of the Ministry of Revenue

463
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,000
embezzled eight million taels.

464
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,199
How dare they!

465
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,959
Ju.

466
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,239
You've certainly

467
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,160
given me a "spectacular" start
to the new year.

468
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,280
We'll use this opportunity

469
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,479
to fix the problematic practices
in the court of Yongzhou.

470
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,160
I would like to know

471
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,239
who else is involved.

472
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,160
Feng Ju.

473
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,079
Investigate the case of corruption

474
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,040
in the Ministry of Revenue
with the Three Ministries.

475
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,839
Anyone found guilty
shall be severely punished.

476
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:54,800
Understood.

477
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,680
According to the information we have,

478
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,839
the three people Prince Ju
impeached today

479
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,560
were all members of his faction.

480
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,599
Why would he remove his own supporters?

481
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,119
Prince Ju must've seen how much it costs

482
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,719
His Lordship to raise troops.

483
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,000
He sacrificed his own

484
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,599
to claim the credit.

485
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,479
Investigate corruption and fill up
the treasury with the confiscated funds.

486
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,839
On the other hand,

487
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,280
he can use this chance

488
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,000
to cut off ties
with the corrupt officials

489
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,079
and protect himself.

490
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,199
It would be killing
two birds with one stone.

491
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,880
Does he not fear losing
the hearts of his other subordinates?

492
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Feng Ju and Yu Wuyuan
have gotten close recently.

493
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,359
Mr. Yu is one
of Prince Huang Chao of Jizhou's aides.

494
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,199
I don't think he came to Yongzhou

495
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,599
without ulterior motives.

496
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:46,760
If he is

497
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,680
providing Feng Ju with ideas,

498
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,400
I think Ju will have
other tricks up his sleeves.

499
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,239
You mean

500
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,920
Prince Ju wants to use
this chance to get rid of dissidents?

501
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,160
Raising an army
will consume a lot of money.

502
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
My father must want the treasury
to be full at this time.

503
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,000
As such,

504
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,359
even if Feng Ju committed mistakes,

505
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,479
I'm sure my father would let things go

506
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,719
if Ju could

507
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,800
supply the money needed.

508
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,839
What's more,

509
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,560
he has a royal decree.

510
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,680
It's even easier for him
to make arrangements now.

511
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:23,680
Notify all the officers

512
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,479
that no mistakes
can be made during this period.

513
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Yes, Your Highness. I will caution them.

514
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,319
Is there anything else
troubling you, Your Highness?

515
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm wondering

516
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,959
what Yu Wuyuan's next step will be.

517
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,599
He wouldn't simply help

518
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,000
Feng Ju out of the kindness of his heart.

519
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,439
Not to mention

520
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,199
he is one of Huang Chao's.

521
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,160
Could it be

522
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
that he intends to use this opportunity

523
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,359
to disrupt Yongzhou's internal affairs?

524
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,239
That is possible.

525
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,000
The Finest Gentry

526
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,680
is no simple character.

527
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,119
Mentor.

528
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,280
Have them keep an eye on him.

529
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,280
Yes, Your Highness.

530
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,719
Greetings, Father.

531
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,680
Long live the Lord.

532
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Why do you look so anxious?

533
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,119
Father,

534
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,040
the royal treasury was robbed.

535
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:25,719
The royal treasury was robbed?

536
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,920
After receiving your order,

537
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:30,119
I started looking into the matter
with the Three Ministries.

538
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,160
To check the ledgers,

539
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,040
I ordered someone
to retrieve them overnight.

540
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,479
But when the person in charge got there,

541
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,560
he discovered
that the royal treasury had been robbed.

542
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,079
Not only was all the money gone,

543
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,560
but the ledgers
of the past years went missing as well.

544
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,880
How dare they.

545
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,319
The royal treasury was robbed
when I just issued orders

546
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,079
to investigate corruption.

547
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,400
It can't be a coincidence.

548
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,839
Any suspicious leads?

549
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,680
What?

550
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,000
Why aren't you speaking?

551
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,079
I... I worry
that I do not have sufficient evidence,

552
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,479
I... I worry
that I do not have sufficient evidence,

553
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,439
and I might end up

554
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,680
getting charged
with framing important ministers.

555
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,680
Don't be concerned. Tell me.

556
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,599
Yes, Father.

557
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,199
I questioned the three guilty officials.

558
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,359
All of them replied

559
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,920
that there was another person involved.

560
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,959
Zhou Zhong,
the other Vice Minister of Revenue.

561
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,479
Zhou Zhong?

562
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,040
He is a relative

563
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,800
of the Feng family by marriage.

564
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,680
The two families are close.

565
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,760
They are bound together for good or ill.

566
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,040
As the Vice Minister of Revenue,

567
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,319
he manages
the finance and warehouse departments.

568
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,839
He is in charge
of overseeing the royal treasury.

569
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,760
He is currently

570
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,920
the most suspicious.

571
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:37,239
Also,

572
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,239
after yesterday's court meeting,

573
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,880
Minister Feng met with Lanxi in private.

574
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,359
She went to see Zhou Zhong afterward.

575
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,680
Arrest Zhou Zhong
and put him in the dungeon.

576
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,839
Interrogate him thoroughly.

577
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,560
If he is indeed guilty,

578
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,239
he shall not escape punishment.

579
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,199
Yes, Father.

580
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,719
Vice Minister of Revenue, Zhou Zhong?

581
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,400
It appears

582
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
that Feng Ju has made his move.

583
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,719
Can you be certain

584
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,839
that he was not involved?

585
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,319
I can vouch for him.

586
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,880
He is upright and honest.

587
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,040
He has been a law-abiding official

588
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,199
of the Ministry of Revenue
for many years.

589
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,479
There is no possibility
of him embezzling funds.

590
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,160
What should we do now, Your Highness?

591
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,839
Solving the embezzlement case

592
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,319
and eliminating corruption in the court

593
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
are the most crucial matters
to my father right now.

594
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,520
If we get involved recklessly,

595
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,280
we will definitely incur his wrath.

596
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,560
Things will go against us then.

597
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,000
As such,

598
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,479
we must find the truth
before Feng Ju closes the case

599
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,160
to turn things around.

600
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,359
Find a chance

601
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,839
and sneak inside the dungeon

602
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,560
to see Zhou Zhong.

603
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,160
Tell him to say nothing but the truth.

604
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:52,319
He mustn't let himself be coerced
into confessing to false charges.

605
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,920
Yes, Your Highness.
I will do that at once.

606
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,239
(Yu Wuyuan,)

607
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:03,760
(what other motives do you have
besides disrupting Yongzhou's affairs)

608
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,160
(for Jizhou?)

609
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,920
(I'll use your body)

610
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,000
(to get the Sacred Jade Moon.)

611
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,760
Your Highness. Something bad happened.

612
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,800
What's wrong?

613
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,079
Minister Feng was injured.

614
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,359
Minister Feng's maid came earlier.

615
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,359
She said Minister Feng went
to the dungeon by herself last night.

616
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
She had yet to return

617
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,719
when dawn came.

618
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,520
The Feng family went searching for her.

619
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
They found her unconscious

620
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,319
on the way to the dungeon.

621
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,560
Prepare the horses immediately!

622
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,839
Yes, Your Highness.

623
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,479
How is she, Your Highness?

624
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,520
The poison she is suffering from is odd.

625
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,479
It messed up
the yin and yang energy in her body,

626
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,520
misaligning her five elements.

627
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,439
I will need the support

628
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,520
of pure yin energy to cure her.

629
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,560
What should we do then, Your Highness?

630
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,160
Don't worry.

631
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,760
I've sealed her blood vessels for now.

632
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,839
Take good care of her.

633
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll be right back.

634
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,800
Yes, Your Highness.

635
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,680
An important minister in my faction

636
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,760
was attacked last night.

637
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,920
They gave her a strange poison.

638
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
We need the energy of pure yin and yang

639
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,239
to cure it.

640
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,520
As such,
I need your Jade Moon Chant to help me.

641
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,920
Let's go. A life is at stake.

642
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,800
She... once expressed feelings for me.

643
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,640
Feelings for you?

644
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,760
What does that have to do with anything?

645
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,119
Come on.

646
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,760
We've temporarily suppressed the poison.

647
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,119
But she is unconscious.

648
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,119
We can't expel it from her body.

649
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,839
We need someone to draw the poison out.

650
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,199
You acted recklessly again.

651
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,560
I'm fine.

652
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,040
The Tianshuang Sect
practices similar techniques.

653
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,239
I'm better at it than you.

654
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,160
The poison has been removed.

655
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,119
She will wake up soon.

656
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,839
The residual poison
in your body may have been expelled,

657
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,760
but it still did your body harm.

658
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,400
Come with me.

659
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,640
Are you still mad

660
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,359
that I drew the poison
into my body to get rid of it?

661
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,719
So you knew I would be mad.

662
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,319
Even if you want to save others,
you can't let yourself be harmed.

663
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,319
I know. Don't worry.

664
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,359
I know my limits.

665
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
I hope that's the case.

666
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,800
Are you worried about me?

667
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,640
No.

668
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,479
Why are you pulling a face then?

669
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,640
I saved her because of you...

670
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,479
So it was because of me...

671
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,000
Because it was an emergency.

672
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,439
It was the right thing to do.

673
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,160
Understand?

674
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,359
How kind and benevolent of you.

675
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,520
Look.

676
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,800
Didn't you have

677
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,800
any other thoughts in mind
when you saved her?

678
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,199
Should I have other thoughts?

679
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,560
(I thought)

680
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,719
(you would at least be jealous.)

681
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,040
(You said it was in the past.)

682
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,319
(Why should I mind?)

683
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,280
(Did you want me
to be jealous or something?)

684
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,599
Why are you mad?

685
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,439
Who is mad?

686
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,280
Do not gauge my heart
with your own mean measure.

687
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,839
What's with that face, then?

688
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:13,199
I was thinking about
how suspicious the entire thing was.

689
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,400
You mean the matter
of Minister Feng getting poisoned?

690
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,760
Why did the specific cure

691
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,160
for that poison
happen to be the Sacred Jade Moon?

692
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
You mean

693
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,040
the culprit was actually after us?

694
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,239
They were using

695
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,760
this opportunity

696
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
to test us.

697
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,479
To verify

698
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,160
if we could actually use the skill.

699
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,040
Who could be behind this?

700
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,520
No matter who they are,

701
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,119
we are in danger.

702
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,920
I worry they will target us.

703
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,719
So, for the time being,
you and I must be together.

704
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,359
We cannot be separated,
and we must look out for each other.

705
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,079
I... I'm just worried
that the person behind this

706
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,640
might have other schemes.

707
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,640
Have you ever heard of giving yourself
away by being overly conscious?

708
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,079
Your Highness, Young Lady is awake.

709
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

710
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,640
I've caused you trouble.

711
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,000
You just recovered.
No need for formalities.

712
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,160
I've heard that there was
a female minister in Yongzhou

713
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,719
as capable as any other man.

714
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,439
Now that I've met you in person,

715
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,400
you truly are one of the greatest beauties
in the world.

716
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,479
You must be Miss Feng.

717
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Thank you for saving my life.

718
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:39,599
No need to be so courteous, Miss Qiwu.

719
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,640
You have such lovely looks

720
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,599
and a beautiful name.

721
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,239
But you have poor eyesight.

722
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,959
Your name means a phoenix
residing in a Chinese parasol tree.

723
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,800
You should find
the best Chinese parasol tree.

724
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,400
Why did you set your eyes
on the cunning Black Foxy?

725
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:03,040
I don't believe I caught your full name.

726
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,839
Oh, I forgot.

727
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,719
I am Bai Fengxi of the Tianshuang Sect.

728
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,319
So you are Heroine Fengxi.

729
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:09,719
You know me?

730
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,520
I've heard a lot about you.

731
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,199
I didn't think
I would get to meet you today.

732
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:15,119
That's such a coincidence.

733
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,839
I wanted to meet you too.

734
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,520
Do you remember anything
about the person who attacked you?

735
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
That person
is highly skilled in martial arts.

736
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,719
He knocked me out in one move.

737
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,119
I wasn't able
to see what he looked like.

738
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,680
I feel a lot better now.

739
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,400
We can discuss this matter later.

740
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,880
I worry

741
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,920
that Prince Ju will use this chance

742
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,199
to harm the Feng family.

743
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,479
The Feng family
has served Yongzhou for a hundred years.

744
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,280
I cannot let the Feng family
fall under my lead.

745
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,479
Qiwu,
we expelled the poison from your body,

746
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,680
but the residual poison remains.

747
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,800
You need rest.

748
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,640
You mustn't overexert yourself.

749
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,040
I don't know
what you guys are talking about,

750
00:33:57,439 --> 00:34:00,000
but I can help you.

751
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:01,839
You?

752
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,119
I've heard that Feng Qiwu of Yongzhou
was a heroic woman

753
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,160
who served in court
and led the Feng family.

754
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,080
As a woman, I have deep respect for you.

755
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
I will help you.

756
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,239
You said it, didn't you?

757
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,520
We need to stay together
for the time being.

758
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,399
We'll use the chance
to solve this matter.

759
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,360
All right.

760
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,760
Rest well, Minister Feng.

761
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,040
Leave the matter

762
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,719
of the treasury theft to us.

763
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,760
Of course, I've heard
that you are highly intelligent.

764
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,959
We will need your assistance.

765
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
I can't go to his residence.

766
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,800
He can't go to where I'm staying at.

767
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,360
How about this?

768
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,280
Can we stay here

769
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,840
and trouble you for a few days?

770
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,760
Of course.

771
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Thank you, Your Highness, Miss Fengxi.

772
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,919
Xiao, please prepare
the rooms for our guests.

773
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,360
Yes, miss.

774
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,159
It's settled then.

775
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,080
Master Bai.

776
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,040
Miss Fengxi and His Highness

777
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,560
have been investigating a case together.

778
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,959
She might not be able
to return to the residence.

779
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,159
She asked me to inform you.

780
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,199
Oh, that girl.

781
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:58,879
Got it.

782
00:34:59,199 --> 00:34:59,959
Have a seat.

783
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,719
We have some leads

784
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,120
regarding the matter you asked

785
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,120
the Fountain Abode to investigate.

786
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,000
According to their investigation,

787
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,239
around the time
the fake Empyrean Token appeared,

788
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Gongye Zhi, a famous ironsmith
in the Imperial City, went missing.

789
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:15,879
Based on our findings,

790
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,239
he was very likely

791
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
one of the Token Keepers.

792
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,919
The mastermind

793
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,399
might be
among the Token Keepers as well.

794
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,360
Missing...

795
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,639
His Highness said

796
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,080
this case
might involve significant matters.

797
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:31,320
You must be extremely careful,
Master Bai.

798
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,320
I thank His Highness for his caution.

799
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,959
Ten thousand silver leaves

800
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,679
and a chest of old ledgers were stolen.

801
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,959
But it is peculiar.

802
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,719
It's understandable

803
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,600
for them to steal money and valuables.

804
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
But why ledgers?

805
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,239
That's why Feng Ju
accused Vice Minister Zhou

806
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,479
of orchestrating an inside job.

807
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,159
To incriminate him,

808
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:01,959
Ju got someone to steal the ledgers.

809
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,840
If we can't find the ledgers,

810
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,600
Vice Minister Zhou
won't be able to escape the blame.

811
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,360
To prevent someone
from tampering or stealing the ledgers,

812
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:12,439
specific personnel

813
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,120
will use long ladders to put them

814
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,479
on the highest shelf
after they are sealed.

815
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,719
Ordinary people
can't get their hands on it.

816
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,320
Even with my Qinggong,

817
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,239
I would need support to reach the top.

818
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,600
I checked.

819
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,159
There are no other signs of support used

820
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,679
apart from two handprints.

821
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,040
Could this person be
four or five zhang tall?

822
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,320
What's this?

823
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,439
The floor here
is made of special material.

824
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:08,760
It is extremely tough.

825
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,080
This person would have to weigh

826
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,800
over hundreds of jin
to leave such a mark.

827
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,159
Weigh hundreds of jin

828
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,760
and be four or five zhang tall?

829
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,600
If someone like that really existed,

830
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,760
he would have been
regarded as a monster

831
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,199
and gotten locked up
the minute he stepped into

832
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:21,919
the capital of Yongzhou.

833
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,320
How could he possibly manage

834
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,479
to come all this way
and rob the treasury?

835
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,520
Could a demon actually be behind this?

836
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,760
There is another possibility.

837
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,239
Several people were working together

838
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,800
and stacking one on top of the other.

839
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:39,800
It gives the illusion
that the culprit was a giant,

840
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,679
but it was just a simple trick.

841
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,560
I didn't expect you to be so good

842
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,120
at reasoning and deduction.

843
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,399
That's not the only thing I'm good at.

844
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,479
You are like a treasure

845
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,520
to me.

846
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,399
Even so,

847
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,879
it's hard to know

848
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,000
how many of them are there

849
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,719
and who they are.

850
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,760
We've got a long way to go
before we uncover the truth.

851
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,399
I can answer that question.

852
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,919
There should be five of them.

853
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,120
Why?

854
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,879
If they just wanted to frame

855
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,639
Vice Minister Zhou,

856
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,040
they only needed to steal the ledgers.

857
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,120
Why did they steal money
and other valuables?

858
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,280
They must have been

859
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,360
tempted by the treasures

860
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,239
in here.

861
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,439
What would you do

862
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:32,800
if you were in their position?

863
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,760
I would take as much as I could,
of course.

864
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,719
That's right.

865
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,479
16 taels weigh one jin.

866
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:40,719
10,000 Silver leaves

867
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,840
weigh a total of 625 jin.

868
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,919
A regular adult

869
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,080
can carry around 100 jin.

870
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,879
So we can infer

871
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,919
that there were around five of them.

872
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,479
I see.

873
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,679
Each chest contains 2,000 silver leaves.

874
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,600
A total of five chests went missing.

875
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,560
It takes skill

876
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,399
to get those five chests out of here

877
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,760
without anyone noticing.

878
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,439
Look at this.

879
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,040
There are traces of wax here.

880
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,360
But it's new.

881
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,760
It must have accidentally come off

882
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,800
when they were moving the chests.

883
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,639
The sealing wax used
in the royal treasury is distinct.

884
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,199
This should be a clue.

885
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,959
Congratulations, Sir.

886
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,120
The Sacred Jade Moon can only suppress
the blood curse temporarily.

887
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,360
If I want to remove it completely,

888
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,840
I will need the Empyrean Token.

889
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:50,159
I have been
making preparations to rebuild

890
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,360
the Locust army in secret.

891
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,080
Now that
you've acquired the divine skill,

892
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,399
will we

893
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:55,760
be leaving?

894
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,439
Why?

895
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,280
I want to see

896
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,280
how Feng Lanxi solves this.

897
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,919
I guess we'll be staying here
for a while longer.

898
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,919
It would be good
if we could use this opportunity

899
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:11,280
to get rid of him.
