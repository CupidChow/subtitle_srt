=Episode 10=

20
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,480
On my way back, I encountered

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,199
a group of flood victims
who were heading to the capital

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,160
to seek refuge.

23
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,440
I know Your Lordship
cares very much for the people,

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
so I lent them a hand.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,599
Mother, your leg
was previously injured...

26
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,239
But Mother,

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,680
didn't you suffer a leg injury before?

28
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,160
You're all right, Xi.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,519
I am so glad.

30
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,760
I've made you worry, Your Highness.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,080
I am all right.

32
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,240
Your Highness has had a tiring journey.

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,839
You've had a tiring trip, Baili.

34
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,080
Return to the palace with me now.

35
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,119
Let's go.

36
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:17,794
(Everlasting Prosperity and Peace)

37
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,160
Your Lordship,
I have another matter to report.

38
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,960
A while ago,

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,759
I ran into

40
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:25,960
the wife of our clan leader
at the Yutan Stream.

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,440
During our conversation,

42
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,279
I learned
that Mother-in-law was a descendant

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,039
of the Xiao family
of the previous dynasty.

44
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,800
Is that true?

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,759
I wouldn't dare lie to Your Lordship.

46
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Madam Xiao has updated
the genealogy register.

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,160
It will be sent to the capital
in a couple of days.

48
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:45,279
Xi. Baili has been so thoughtful of you.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,520
She cares for you deeply.

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,080
We in Yongzhou
have always valued filial piety.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Shouldn't you give her a ride

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
as a gesture of gratitude?

53
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,399
Of course.

54
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,119
Your Lordship,
I would like to report something.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,720
Come forth.

56
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,720
Greetings, Your Lordship, Your Highness.

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,119
While one should sing the praises
of Her Highness' low profile voyage

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,759
and her kindness in helping the needy,

59
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,880
her escort, Sun Mingyang,
should be punished.

60
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,320
How so?

61
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,199
As the saying goes,

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
no royalty should shoulder
unnecessary risks.

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,440
Her Highness is of noble status.

64
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,600
As her escort and protector,

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
he should have advised Her Highness
to think twice.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,479
Even if Her Highness insisted on
traveling with the commoners,

67
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,399
he shouldn't have dispatched
all other guards away.

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,080
Has he verified the background
of these commoners

69
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,479
to see if traitors lie among them?

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,960
The Six States are in turmoil.

71
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,000
Prince Yongping barely escaped
from an assassination attempt.

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,559
If something dire happened
to Her Highness,

73
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,639
our nation would not be able
to bear this pain.

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
I should be punished for my oversight!

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,279
How do you think we should proceed?

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,160
To make sure Official Sun retains
this valuable lesson,

77
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,600
he should be administered
public flagellation.

78
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,559
In public? That's too harsh a sanction.

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,040
Sun Mingyang committed a grave mistake.

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,320
On a legal level,
he deserves a punishment.

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,799
On a personal level,
his mother is part of the Feng family.

82
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,559
As the chief of the Feng family,

83
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,200
I should punish him severely
to set an example.

84
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,480
Your Lordship, Your Highness,

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,320
is my logic not sound?

86
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,519
Yes, it is.

87
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:39,440
However, public flagellation

88
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,399
is overly harsh.

89
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
A three-year confiscation of his salary.

90
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:43,959
Noted.

91
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,959
There is one other person
who should be punished too.

92
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:47,799
Who?

93
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,040
Vice Minister Yang of Rite.

94
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,480
Ministry of Rite is in charge of the
homecoming ceremony today.

95
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,519
Her Highness returned to the capital
in plain clothing

96
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,040
yet no one was informed
of such a matter.

97
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,519
If an assassin

98
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,279
lurked among the civilians and struck,

99
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
will you be able
to shoulder the outcome?

100
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,399
My sincerest apologies!

101
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,640
It seems like

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,079
what you did today

103
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,959
suffered from a lack of foresight.

104
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,040
I am indeed at fault.

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,119
Yuan Lu.

106
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, Your Lordship.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
Find another person
to give Baili a ride.

108
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,440
Noted.

109
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,640
Interrupting your carriage
is also a crime, Your Lordship.

110
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,839
Please punish me for my mistake.

111
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,959
You are a loyal servant, Official Feng.

112
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,559
You have not made any mistakes.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,640
Hop on in.

114
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,261
(Everlasting Prosperity and Peace)

115
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:56,959
Father,

116
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,679
when Her Highness mentioned the Xiaos,

117
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,359
why was His Lordship so happy?

118
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,399
His Lordship's mother was a palace maid.

119
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,040
Before he inherited the throne,

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,880
he was ranked the lowest
among all princes.

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,799
If the then heir of Lord of Yongzhou
did not pass away in a riding accident,

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,640
the throne might be...

123
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,079
The previous Lord knew how lowly
the mother of the current Lord is,

124
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,799
and that's why the current Lord married
Princess Yige of the Imperial Family.

125
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,440
No wonder His Lordship is always
harsh towards His Highness

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,679
but he dotes on Baili, who came

127
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,519
from a lowly background.

128
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,399
Stop this nonsense.

129
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,760
Baili knows more tricks

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,559
than Prince Ju will ever know.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,119
Now that she has returned
to the capital,

132
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,519
His Highness will have another patch
of a rough time.

133
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,239
Lanxi is almost like another person

134
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,480
after our last encounter

135
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,079
several months ago.

136
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,440
His attitude towards me...

137
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,359
You have to thank

138
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,480
your son, Ju, for that.

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,440
He is your child too, Your Lordship.

140
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,239
He is your favorite.

141
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,079
It's precisely because of that

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,600
that he grew the guts to bring harm

143
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,200
to his own brother.

144
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,559
Your Lordship.

145
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,839
Ju is young and naive.

146
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,399
He was used by someone unscrupulous.

147
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,160
Report!

148
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,600
Your Lordship, Prince Ju

149
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,160
seeks an audience with you in the hall.

150
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,079
Make him wait in the side hall.

151
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Yes, Your Lordship.

152
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,519
You can speak

153
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,799
to your son.

154
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,679
I will not join the conversation.

155
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,880
Do remind him of

156
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,760
how foolish his recent endeavors

157
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,640
have been.

158
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,119
I asked Lanxi to give you a ride

159
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,040
because I wanted everyone to see

160
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,679
how loving

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,480
the royal family of Yongzhou is.

162
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,839
The state that fights

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
among themselves first

164
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,279
will be the first state to be devoured

165
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,359
by the rest.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,119
We have been together
for more than two decades.

167
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,519
You can understand this necessity,
don't you?

168
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,600
Yes.

169
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,959
Oh,

170
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,200
if you have the time,

171
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,799
please pay more attention to Feng Chang.

172
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,119
He is my eldest son.

173
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,760
(Mother, your leg
was previously injured...)

174
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,799
(You're all right, Xi.)

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,080
(I am so glad.)

176
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,400
Not even a glimpse.

177
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,000
She would rather put on

178
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,599
a loving mother act with Lanxi

179
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,840
than look at her biological son
in the face.

180
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,479
Shopkeeper, we have served him
three jin of wine.

181
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,640
He doesn't want any female companion
or side dish.

182
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,080
He's Prince Chang!

183
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
He wants to drown his sorrow
in my restaurant

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,039
but he didn't reveal his identity.

185
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,719
We can only play dumb.

186
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:07,919
Go dilute his wine

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,840
with some water.

188
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,320
Yes, sir.

189
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,119
Prince Ju.

190
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,479
Her Highness can see you now.

191
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,479
Mother.

192
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,080
Has Father left?

193
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,239
Why didn't father allow me

194
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,520
to offer my greetings just now?

195
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,239
Is he...

196
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,239
Never panic in the face of surprises.

197
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,840
I just taught you that

198
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,559
and you forgot all about it.

199
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,640
Right.

200
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,640
I took everything

201
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,479
into account

202
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,679
but I failed to realize that Feng Lanxi
is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

203
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,080
He hid his claws well

204
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,280
for more than a decade.

205
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,799
Now that he bore his claws,

206
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,320
they are sharper and more well-hidden
than mine.

207
00:09:59,239 --> 00:09:59,880
Mother,

208
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,640
what did Father tell you?

209
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,679
Your father said

210
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,119
that your recent endeavors
were quite frankly embarrassing.

211
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,640
He wanted both of us to remain obedient

212
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,520
and stop causing trouble.

213
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,880
What should we do then?

214
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,760
Why are you panicking?

215
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,239
I have been with your father
since I was 16.

216
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,520
I know what he's thinking.

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,960
All these years

218
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,239
when you try to outdo

219
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,719
Feng Lanxi, be it openly or secretly,

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,239
it is done with your father's
tacit agreement.

221
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,440
It's because deep down,

222
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,280
he is ashamed

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,719
of the fact that he is a child
of a palace maid.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,119
That's why he never

225
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,000
ever liked Yige,

226
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,719
not to mention

227
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,159
her bloodline, Feng Lanxi.

228
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,000
But remember this,

229
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,719
no matter how much your father

230
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,719
loves both of us,

231
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,640
nothing can entice him as well
as power and glory can.

232
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,960
On my way back,

233
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,719
your uncle had a missive delivered to me.

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,640
He said that after the Empyrean Token
went missing,

235
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,320
your father
has been amassing the military

236
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,119
by the border.

237
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
At the moment,

238
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,039
he doesn't want

239
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,760
any domestic trouble.

240
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Mother,

241
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,840
maybe I can volunteer
to train the troops?

242
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,760
If I can come back
with an achievement, Father will...

243
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,599
No!

244
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,159
Swords on the battlefield can't tell
if you are a friend or foe.

245
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
They are not like what you do
in the training field.

246
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,320
I only have a son.

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,760
I can't risk losing you.

248
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,159
You, however, should get married soon.

249
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,760
Marry Yan and establish a family.

250
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
That will put my mind to rest.

251
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,359
Mother, I...

252
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,159
Yan's father, Duke Liang

253
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,440
holds an important position
in the court.

254
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,640
You know very well the benefits

255
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
of marrying her.

256
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,640
I know.

257
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,880
But I have no time for it now.

258
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,159
Whenever I think about how Lanxi keeps
stealing my thunder,

259
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,840
I get frustrated.

260
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,039
Your father doesn't want you

261
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,000
to eliminate Feng Lanxi in this
straightforward fashion.

262
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,760
After all,

263
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,640
Feng Lanxi
is the firstborn of the late queen.

264
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,520
But if a third person does it,

265
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,520
we won't be dragged into this.

266
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,000
What would you like to pawn, miss?

267
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,760
All of them.

268
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,559
After seeing what you have here,

269
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,840
I can offer you three silver leaves
maximum.

270
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,039
Three silver leaves?

271
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,200
That's too little.

272
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,119
It's already a generous offer.

273
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,280
Miss, if you pawn that too,

274
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,799
I can offer you a higher price.

275
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,440
Don't take it off.

276
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,880
You cannot sell this hairpin for wine.

277
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,559
This one is not for pawning.

278
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,000
Sir,

279
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,159
three silver leaves is too low an offer.

280
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,200
Five silver leaves maximum.

281
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,719
Not more than that.

282
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,080
But...

283
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,760
If it's still too low a price,

284
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
you can consult another pawn shop.

285
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,559
Five silver leaves it is.

286
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,640
Here you go.

287
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,880
Thanks.

288
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,280
Twenty-something people.

289
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,280
Five silver leaves

290
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,479
are only enough
for a day's worth of food.

291
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,359
I will pawn this vase.

292
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,479
Bugger off.

293
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,640
You think you're in House of Jade?

294
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,640
One broken vase

295
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,039
is not worth three silver leaves.

296
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,080
Have you retained the password?

297
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,880
If you have any financial problems,

298
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,080
walk into any House of Jade branch

299
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,559
and you can take anything cheaper than

300
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,760
1,000 silver leaves.

301
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,800
(House of Jade)

302
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,080
Here, please.

303
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,080
Please wait for a moment.

304
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,200
Miss, how may I help?

305
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,640
Dark sky and yellow soil,
monolith pure as jade.

306
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,880
Revered, as the mountain;
followed, as the path to righteousness.

307
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,239
Well received, miss.

308
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,919
I need 50 silver leaves.

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,679
I'll be right back.

310
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,640
Please wait here.

311
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,228
(House of Jade)

312
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,000
Have a safe trip.

313
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,640
He fainted.

314
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,320
His legs are twitching.

315
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,239
A demonic possession?

316
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:40,960
Oh my god.

317
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,359
What should we do?

318
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,960
What should we do?

319
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,159
No idea.

320
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,840
This must be demonic possession.

321
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,919
Calm down.

322
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
It's just epilepsy.

323
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,039
Find a room.

324
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,520
Help me.

325
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,080
Help me carry him inside.

326
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,039
Come, here.

327
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,799
Thank god you're here to help.

328
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,320
This is what you requested.

329
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,599
Thanks.

330
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,119
That said...

331
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,960
I know

332
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,440
this sickness is treated as a taboo.

333
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:14,559
I won't tell anyone.

334
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,840
Oh, find him a physician.

335
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,280
Head to the Prince Chang's Residence now.

336
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,799
Noted.

337
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,559
Chang, here.

338
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,239
It's so delicious, mother.

339
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,039
Go away. Don't call me mother.

340
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,000
Chang.

341
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,479
You took a fall?

342
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,080
Let me have a look.

343
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,520
Let me have a look.

344
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
You're awake, Your Highness.

345
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Why am I here?

346
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,840
Did it happen again?

347
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,520
Someone saved you in time.

348
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,159
I also used a Six-Herbs Calming Pill
on you.

349
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,880
The people from House of Jade
sent me back?

350
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,320
This sickness of yours

351
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,919
hasn't resurfaced for many years.

352
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,200
It must be due to the cold
you contacted earlier on

353
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,280
and you had too much to drink.

354
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,318
(Feng Chang's Residence Housekeeper,
Uncle De)

355
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,159
Don't worry.

356
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,840
I have already told everyone

357
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,440
that you left the capital

358
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,719
on a hunting trip.

359
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,760
Your Highness,

360
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,359
drink this.

361
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,679
You're dismissed for now.

362
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,160
Yes, sir.

363
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,800
Mother.

364
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,680
Come.

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,560
Young Master.

366
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
- What happened, Young Master?
- Chang!

367
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,599
- Chang!
- Young Master, wake up!

368
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,560
- It's demonic possession.
- Young Master!

369
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:22,839
Monster.

370
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,959
- Monster.
- Young Master.

371
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,719
What a freak.

372
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:25,678
(Young Baili)

373
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,880
His birth brought

374
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,199
nothing but misfortune to me.
That's why I'm here.

375
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,000
(Young Feng Chang)
And now, he's possessed by a demon.

376
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,640
His Highness will not like me.

377
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,880
I don't care. I don't want to see him.

378
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
Mother.

379
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,520
Uncle De.

380
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,040
Mother saw me

381
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,959
(Young Uncle De)
in the garden just now.

382
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,920
Why did she say she was not my mother?

383
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,839
It's not that Her Highness
doesn't acknowledge you as her son.

384
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,239
She has her own difficulty now.

385
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,359
So she can't.

386
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,160
When you grow up and make her proud,

387
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,760
she will call you her son.

388
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,160
Uncle De,

389
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,839
(Teenager Feng Chang)
if I can recite Long Ballad,

390
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,000
will she acknowledge me as her son?

391
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,719
Your Highness!

392
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,680
Are you all right, Your Highness?

393
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,239
Do not let anyone know.

394
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,239
If His Lordship knows

395
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,359
that I gave birth
to this demonic bastard,

396
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,000
it might affect the one

397
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,800
in my womb now.

398
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,760
He's a jinx.

399
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,000
Your Highness.

400
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,040
I heard everything.

401
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,280
She called me a bastard.

402
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,040
Don't overthink it.

403
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,880
Her Highness was forced
to use that term.

404
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:23,760
Uncle De,

405
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,439
when will you stop lying to me?

406
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,199
Someone!

407
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,000
Is there anyone else
who witnessed the episode?

408
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,280
No one else, sir.

409
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,199
Do you have the ledger for that day?

410
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
I'll give it to you here.

411
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,640
Destroy it.

412
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,239
Noted.

413
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,319
Since you're the owner of House of Jade,

414
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,199
you will be spared.

415
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,400
If I ever hear

416
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,079
something I don't want to hear...

417
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,920
Nothing will go out, sir.

418
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,199
Bring them in.

419
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,079
I'll deal

420
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,560
with their lives.

421
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,319
Bring them in.

422
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,079
Go.

423
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,640
(That's what I get
for seeing what I shouldn't have.)

424
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,000
Why are you here?

425
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,520
Why were you sleeping here?

426
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,560
The physician said
that Langhua would wake up soon.

427
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,359
Her body needs to heal
so he wrote a prescription.

428
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,680
Apparently, even crushing the herbs
will incur a fee.

429
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,040
I will not pay for that

430
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,680
so I crushed the herbs myself.

431
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,760
While I was working on it,

432
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,920
perhaps it was too quiet,

433
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,000
I fell asleep.

434
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,040
Your Highness, Miss Fengxi

435
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,760
withdrew 50 silver leaves
from House of Jade today.

436
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,319
Noted.

437
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
If you fall sick

438
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:47,239
to avoid paying this petty fee,

439
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,479
it won't be worth it.

440
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,079
Living in the capital of Yongzhou
is not easy.

441
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,199
Everything is so expensive.

442
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,319
What now?

443
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,560
Tired of being the Acting Leader
of Tianshuang Sect?

444
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,319
You know me.

445
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,959
I'm not built for it.

446
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:08,680
Also,

447
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:09,479
we have a lot of disciples.

448
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,640
I can't manage all of them.

449
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,839
Some of them even revel
in disobeying me.

450
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,079
I am exhausted.

451
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,160
It's amusing to see you all flustered

452
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,079
for something for once.

453
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You won my respect, truly.

454
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,520
Fountain Abode is huge

455
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
and everything is so organized.

456
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,439
Want to know how I do it?

457
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,439
I can teach you.

458
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,920
I don't have the tuition fee.

459
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,239
A bowl of noodles will do.

460
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,800
The one you made on the ship.

461
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,439
Just a bowl of noodles?

462
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,400

478
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,959
Huang Chao wants to return
the Empyrean Token?

479
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,000
Interesting.

480
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,560
Your Highness,
isn't the token a counterfeit?

481
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,760
That's why it's interesting.

482
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm afraid

483
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,880
this is Mr. Yu's idea.

484
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,640
Sir, Minister Feng
has come to visit you.

485
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,040
Let her wait in the main hall.

486
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,040
Noted.

487
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,920
Your Highness,
she just did you a huge favor.

488
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,199
Perhaps you can meet her here?

489
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,199
It will be less formal.

490
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,479
Stop it.

491
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,239
I'm not spouting nonsense.

492
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,280
Disregarding Minister Feng's
exceptional character,

493
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,719
like what they say,

494
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:17,160
if you want a favor from someone,

495
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,880
you treat him nicely.

496
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,560
Am I not nice enough?

497
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,359
I know love has no place
in your heart, sir.

498
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:24,199
But

499
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,800
giving her the title of wife

500
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,079
in exchange for the support from
the entire Feng family

501
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,359
sounds like a splendid deal.

502
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:32,959
Are you done?

503
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:36,680
Your...

504
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,920
Sorry for the long wait, Minister Feng.

505
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,160
You look good, Your Highness.

506
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,479
You must have had several days
of good sleep.

507
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,920
All thanks

508
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,119
to your timely help
outside of the city yesterday.

509
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,880
How may I help, Minister Feng?

510
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,239
Now that you have the title
of Prince Yongping,

511
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,040
His Lordship is pondering
about your marriage.

512
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,199
What is your opinion, Your Highness?

513
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,599
Should I intervene?

514
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,199
Give me your advice, Minister Feng.

515
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,599
If you can ask for my hands properly,

516
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,439
I can make sure

517
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,479
that you never have to worry

518
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,040
about a thing in your future.

519
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,520
I like your candor, Minister Feng.

520
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,599
If I agree to this, however,

521
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,000
I will become a man who has to rely

522
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,959
on his wife to succeed.

523
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,160
I burned the bridge with Her Highness

524
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,400
in front of His Lordship
and other ministers.

525
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,599
I'm on my way to becoming a pariah.

526
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,160
I came here hastily

527
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,040
not because you need me,

528
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,880
but because

529
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,199
I need you, Your Highness.

530
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,880
I do not care much about romance

531
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:14,119
and I do not want to
ruin your happiness forever.

532
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,400
It sounds like

533
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,880
your heart already belongs
to someone else, Your Highness.

534
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,680
Only to the world.

535
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,040
Then for the sake of...

536
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,160
But I detest those who sacrifice love

537
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,400
in the name of the world's betterment.

538
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:29,719
I'm afraid

539
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,640
I have to turn you down, Minister Feng.

540
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,800
I cannot

541
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,719
ask for your hands at the moment.

542
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,880
However, I can promise you

543
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,719
that the Feng family will continue holding

544
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,319
onto its lofty position.

545
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,680
Thanks, Your Highness.

546
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,319
I understand.

547
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:50,760
Don't worry, Your Highness.

548
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,199
The Feng family is still your Feng family.

549
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,040
I will also wait for the day

550
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,040
I become yours.

551
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:01,719
Having your assistance

552
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,119
is already a blessing.

553
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,920
Although

554
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,760
you cannot reciprocate
my feelings today,

555
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,599
I will continue to work hard

556
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:15,079
to help you claim the throne earlier.

557
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,560
(The only man in this world
who can be this indifferent towards me)

558
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,680
(is him.)

559
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,640
(However,)

560
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,959
(if he will marry me that easily,)

561
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,560
(then he is not the Prince Lanxi I know.)

562
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,040
From Xuejuan Goods,
ten ingots of Pine Ink,

563
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,160
thirty Huzhou brushes,

564
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,319
ten thousand Xuan papers
and Xuelang papers...

565
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,959
Five silver leaves here.

566
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,680
One snow twill clothing article,

567
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,119
one set of Lunar Headdress

568
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,319
and fifty silver leaves from House of Jade.

569
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,719
You must be mistaken.

570
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,319
Only females need snow twill.

571
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,920
We do not have female masters.

572
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,839
Who will need it?

573
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,880
This purchase

574
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,400
was made by His Highness outside.

575
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,599
His Highness?

576
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,040
There must be a mistake.

577
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,160
His Highness does not mingle around.

578
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,280
Why would he purchase feminine products?

579
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,520
Return the invoice to House of Jade.

580
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,199
Noted.

581
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,599
Madam.

582
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,959
I am heading to House of Jade.
Give it to me.

583
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,479
I can't burden you so, madam.

584
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,760
Besides, this is His Highness'
private affair.

585
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,160
His Highness and I are a family.

586
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,520
Miss Huan.

587
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,199
Should we inform Young Master?

588
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:02,880
No need.

589
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,760
It's just a trivial matter.

590
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,520
No need to bother Young Master.

591
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,959
Right.

592
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
(I'm sure my eyes)

593
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
(did not fool me that day.)

594
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,599
(You said you couldn't care less
about romance.)

595
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:16,959
(Let me see)

596
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,319
(who you bought the snow twill
and the accessories for.)

597
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,223
(House of Jade)

598
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,119
Minister Feng.

599
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,319
Welcome.

600
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:35,920
This is the invoice you sent
to Prince Yongping's Residence?

601
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,760
Oh, this...

602
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,040
In my opinion,

603
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,760
it's a forgery.

604
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,119
A forgery?

605
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,239
Yes.

606
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,160
The similarity is there

607
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,199
but the honorific spacing
and the characters

608
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,079
cannot escape my eyes.

609
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,400
Recently, I have heard of this thief

610
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,319
who forged restaurant or jewelry bills

611
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,280
and sent them to the rich.

612
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,160
If you do not pay attention to it,

613
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,839
you'll walk into the trap.

614
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,520
Are you speaking the truth?

615
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,040
Why would I lie?

616
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,480
(House of Jade)

617
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,880
Don't worry, Your Highness.

618
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,319
Other than the owner of House of Jade,

619
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,439
all maids

620
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,079
or servants who saw you

621
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,800
have been dealt with.

622
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,000
Only maids and servants?

623
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,400
Wait.

624
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,079
I remember there was

625
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,439
a lady in white.

626
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,439
Your Highness,

627
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,359
if the lady didn't intervene

628
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,439
when you had your episode...

629
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:46,800
I don't care.

630
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,920
Those who saw me in that situation

631
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,880
have to die.

632
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,680
Investigate further.

633
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,479
Identify the lady.

634
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:58,520
Yes, sir.

635
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,040
Where are you going, Gu Yu?

636
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,959
I agreed to hang out with a few friends
from the capital of Yongzhou.

637
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,280
Don't head out today.

638
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,040
You sure give a lot of orders, Xiyun.

639
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,560
I have a pair of legs.

640
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,479
I can go wherever I want.

641
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,280
Master said I would...

642
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,119
Master told you to look after us
for the moment.

643
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,040
You really think
you're the Acting Leader?

644
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,959
I know you resent me,

645
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,079
Gu Yu.

646
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,079
Let's spar today.

647
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,839
If you can defeat me,

648
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,839
I will not meddle
in your affair anymore.

649
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,560
Do we have a deal?

650
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,680
If you don't want to spar with me,

651
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,319
you have to train hard.

652
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,920
Don't act tough
if you don't have what it takes.

653
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,239
Xiyun, Langhua is awake now.

654
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,239
Continue your training.

655
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,439
Let's go.

656
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,479
All right.

657
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,119
Stop dallying.

658
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:35,880
Begin your training now.

659
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,079
You're finally awake.

660
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,359
Do you have any idea

661
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,079
how worried we were about you?

662
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,400
Your pulse is still weak

663
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,079
but it is much more stable now.

664
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,599
Sorry for the trouble.

665
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,239
No, no trouble

666
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,199
at all.

667
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:56,520
Here.

668
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,400
Drink this broth.

669
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,599
I'll have someone
brew some congee for you.

670
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,319
Here.

671
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,000
This broth is too bitter for me.

672
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:10,680
Langhua, bitter medicine
makes the best medicine.

673
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,280
It's easier for you to say that.

674
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,119
You should drink it.

675
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,280
Jiurong, feed her the broth.

676
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,119
I'll find some food for you.

677
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,400
No, I will not drink it.

678
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,119
It costs ten silver leaves
for one portion.

679
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,599
Xiyun spent a great deal of effort

680
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,479
to get you this.

681
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,319
But it's very, very bitter.

682
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,280
I know it's hard to swallow

683
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,439
so I prepared this for you.

684
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,359
You did?

685
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,920
I'll drink the broth

686
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,319
but after that,

687
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,160
you have to tell me what happened
when I was out.

688
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,040
No problem.

689
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,560
Here, drink it.

690
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,239
Xiyun!

691
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,600
The homing pigeon to Master
has returned.

692
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,919
We still failed
to deliver the letter to him.

693
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,919
Where do you think Master went?

694
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,840
The letter couldn't reach him?

695
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,560
Yes.

696
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,600
Did

697
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,360
something bad happen to him?

698
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,800
He's a powerful man.

699
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,199
No bad thing can come to him.

700
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,439
Don't worry.

701
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,439
And don't let anyone know,

702
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,479
especially Langhua.

703
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,719
She just recovered. She can't risk
having her qi flow disrupted.

704
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,959
Cook something for her now.

705
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,159
I'll figure out a way.

706
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,760
Noted.

707
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:53,919
Here.

708
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:54,719
Did you get everything down?

709
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,600
Yes.

710
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,320
Go then.

711
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,000
Mister.

712
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,054
(House of Jade)

713
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:02,520
Miss,

714
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,080
you're here again.

715
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
I'm looking for Hei Fengxi.

716
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,879
Miss,

717
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,679
House of Jade does not contact
the clients directly.

718
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:11,199
Also...

719
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:11,800
Don't worry.

720
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
He told me

721
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,800
to come here if there's an emergency.

722
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,239
Tell him

723
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,399
that I have an emergency.

724
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,959
Miss, please wait here.

725
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,600
I will send someone to him now.

726
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,560
Thank you.

727
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,320
No problem.

728
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:32,146
(Jizhou)

729
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,763
(Invitation to Six States Banquet.
from Emperor Chunxi)

730
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,719
His Majesty has issued a decree

731
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,919
to hold a Six States banquet
to welcome me.

732
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,360
I will head
to the Imperial City tomorrow.

733
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:44,679
What do you think

734
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:46,800
His Majesty will do to me?

735
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,679
In my opinion,

736
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,560
His Majesty will have two choices.

737
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:52,600
One,

738
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:55,040
accept the Empyrean Token,
reward you handsomely,

739
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,280
and praise Jizhou.

740
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,679
Jizhou will be stronger than ever.

741
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,639
However, His Majesty may use Jizhou

742
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,040
as the scapegoat to spare
the Imperial Family from dishonor.

743
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,600
And then, the other five States

744
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,199
will view Jizhou as their common enemy.

745
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,439
What should I do?

746
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,600
Even if this hypothesis
does not come true,

747
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,639
the other States will still view Jizhou
as their enemy.

748
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,600
But you are never afraid of them,
are you, Your Highness?

749
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,320
You know me too well,

750
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,280
Wuyuan.

751
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,800
And the other choice?

752
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,800
His Majesty will notice that the token
is a counterfeit

753
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,840
and accuse you of submitting
a fake token

754
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,399
so that you can keep the real one.

755
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:33,760
You will then be punished.

756
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:37,800
This sounds worse.

757
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,000
However,

758
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,360
as long as His Majesty

759
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,760
believes the token is a real one,

760
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,879
then this will never occur.

761
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,280
But it's a counterfeit.

762
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,639
Where did it come from then?

763
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,399
Are you saying

764
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,600
that

765
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,800
this token
came from the Imperial Palace?

766
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,000
All Six States will fight
for the Empyrean Token.

767
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:57,159
The only one

768
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,120
who can profit from that is His Majesty.

769
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,199
A day without the reappearance
of the Empyrean Token

770
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,199
is a day with more chaos and conflicts.

771
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,959
Whether the token is real or fake,

772
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,040
it has to be returned
to the Imperial City.

773
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,360
You take advantage of me
for the sake of the world.

774
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,280
But you don't want

775
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,439
a broken world, do you?

776
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,520
Although what you really cares about
is the world,

777
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,320
you choose me to be its owner.

778
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,159
In that case,

779
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,600
you must already have a solution.

780
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,919
Actually...

781
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,439
Come out now,

782
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:43,560
my dear sister.

783
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,144
(Princess of Jizhou, Huang Yu)

784
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:47,959
Wuyuan.

785
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,520
Your Highness.

786
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,840
Why

787
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,520
are you eavesdropping here?

788
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,280
I am not eavesdropping.

789
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
I was here to look for you, Wuyuan.

790
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,199
Coincidentally, you were here.

791
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,320
It's been a while,

792
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,800
Wuyuan.

793
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
You didn't visit me this time
when you're back.

794
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,000
He has been

795
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,479
advising me lately.

796
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,520
He doesn't have time for you.

797
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,439
I don't care.

798
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,840
Wuyuan finally came back

799
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,320
but he has to go to the Imperial City
with you tomorrow.

800
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,320
He has to

801
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:20,560
hang out with me today.

802
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,159
Wuyuan.

803
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:31,919
Come.

804
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,000
Let me play this song for you.

805
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,320
I've been practicing

806
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,479
the zither sheet you taught me.

807
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:16,679
Wuyuan,

808
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:17,800
what do you think?

809
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,800
Wuyuan,

810
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,719
how did I do?

811
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,959
The music of your zither

812
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,879
brought back memories.

813
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,399
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

814
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:33,840
A good thing, of course.

815
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,479
Which is better?

816
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,679
The zither or the musician?

817
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,840
The maverick who roams the world alone,

818
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,879
adored by the world
but finds love in none.

819
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,040
The author of these two lines

820
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
must have read my life thoroughly.

821
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,919
I appreciate

822
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,560
your sentiment.

823
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,840
However, as a member of Empyrean Yu family,

824
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,919
I will not live beyond 30 years old.

825
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:00,280
I can only reject

826
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,159
your precious feelings.

827
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,120
But...

828
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,959
Sorry

829
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,919
for letting you down.

830
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,159
Haven't I told you already?

831
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,360
So?

832
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,439
I know he would reject me

833
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,080
but it won't change a thing.

834
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:04,719
If he still breathes for another year,

835
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,639
I'll confess to him for another year.

836
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,399
If he still breathes for a decade,
I will confess to him for a decade.

837
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,120
I will not

838
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,639
fall in love with any other man.

839
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,280
All right.

840
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,360
Don't cry.

841
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,560
I have asked the chefs to prepare

842
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,040

Shopkeeper, any news?

844
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,879
I have delivered your message

845
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,000
but he might not be in this residence.

846
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,959
It's getting late now

847
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:02,479
so I should head back.

848
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,239
If he comes here,

849
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,439
let him know

850
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,479
that I'll be waiting for him here
tomorrow noon.

851
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:08,760
Okay.

852
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,360
Why are you tailing me?

853
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,439
I'm here for your head.

854
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,000
Charge!

855
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,320
