(Examination Hall)

21
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:56,627
(Candidate, Xu Yuxin)

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,199
Be honest.

23
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,759
How did you bring the cheat sheet
into the Examination Hall?

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,119
I

25
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,080
did not bring the cheat sheet.

26
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,600
You're caught red-handed.

27
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,720
How dare you deny this?

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,559
When I entered the Examination Hall,

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
I didn't bring any cheat sheet.

30
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,479
Do you know the punishment
for bringing a cheat sheet?

31
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,240
I'll give you a second chance.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,399
If you tell us the truth,

33
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,199
I'll write a request to
the Ministry of Justice

34
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,320
to ask for a pardon.

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,039
Actually,

36
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:01,960
the cheat sheet

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,119
has always been in the Examination Hall.

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,759
You must come clean about it.

39
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,919
My name is Xu Yuxin

40
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,320
and I'm from Jiannan City.

41
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,559
Just like the other scholars, who came
to the capital for the examination,

42
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,240
I stayed in Luming Inn.

43
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,240
I met

44
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,839
a broker that day.

45
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,639
Who are you?

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,440
Is there anything I can help you with?

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,679
I'm a mere broker.

48
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,679
I'm not interested in your business.

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,559
You've misunderstood, sir.

50
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,919
I'm not here for business.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,399
I'm here to help you.

52
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,279
Help?

53
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,839
I can provide you

54
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,279
with the cheat sheet
for this royal examination.

55
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,000
Moreover,

56
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,479
you don't need to
bring the cheat sheet into the hall.

57
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,039
The broker told me that

58
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,000
as long as I give him
my examination number plate,

59
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,720
he'll leave the cheat sheet

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,039
on the wall of the examination cell

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
of the same number.

62
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,639
I just wanted to give it a try.

63
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,919
So, I paid him a deposit of
half of the total cost.

64
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,519
I didn't expect that

65
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,200
there's really

66
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,799
a cheat sheet on the wall.

67
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm telling the truth.

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
I dare not to lie.

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,119
Bring him down.

70
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,119
Come on.

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,000
If he speaks the truth,

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,559
this would be the biggest cheating case

73
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,040
in Yong's history.

74
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,480
The interests behind this case

75
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,440
would involve people from the palace.

76
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm afraid that

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,200
the situation might be

78
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,359
far worse than you expected.

79
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,279
This is the cheat sheet

80
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,079
for your review, sir.

81
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,760
How is this possible?

82
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,000
You're

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the chief examiner of this examination.

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,160
What are your plans, sir?

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Stop the examination immediately.

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,920
Gather all candidates at the forecourt.

87
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,519
Examine each examination room.

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,359
Also,

89
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,200
send someone to the palace

90
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,760
to inform His Lordship.

91
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:21,239
There was a cheating incident
during the examination.

92
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
This examination

93
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,480
was supposed to be
your stepping-stone to success.

94
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,105
(Revered, as the mountain)

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,799
Sir.

96
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,678
(The Model Teacher of Myriad Ages)
We've examined

97
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,720
all the examination cells.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,119
We found six cheat sheets in total.

99
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,320
When I call upon your number,

100
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,119
please take a step forward.

101
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,559
Number 15, Class A.

102
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,000
Sir, I did not cheat.

103
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,760
I am innocent, sir.

104
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,440
Your innocence will be proven

105
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,200
after we conduct the investigations.

106
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,839
Number 17, Class A.

107
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,640
I'm wrongly accused, sir.
I did not cheat.

108
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,720
Please clear my name.

109
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,720
Number 6, Class B.

110
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,959
(The Model Teacher of Myriad Ages)
I, Feng Shiying, did not cheat.

111
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm innocent!

112
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,720
Number 15, Class B.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,720
I, Liu Jiannan, did not cheat.

114
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,279
I did not cheat, Mentor.

115
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,399
Number 1, Class C.

116
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,079
I didn't cheat.

117
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,359
- Number 9, Class C.
- I didn't do it.

118
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,279
Mentor Pei, I'm wronged.

119
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,679
I'm wrongly accused!

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,160
Miss.

121
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,720
Oh, dear!

122
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,480
Something happened.

123
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,679
What happened?

124
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,359
According to the news from the palace,

125
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,559
someone cheated in the Examination Hall.

126
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,720
Young Master Feng's name is on the list.

127
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,640
Shiying?

128
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,720
But he wouldn't bring a cheat sheet.

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,279
Not only did he bring a cheat sheet,

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,160
but the cheat sheet

131
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,119
also contained the answer
for the examination.

132
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,239
What?

133
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:32,720
Get the horses ready.

134
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes.

135
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:38,959
Greetings, Your Highness.

136
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,239
I've heard about the incident
at the Examination Hall.

137
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,320
They can no longer
hold back their desire.

138
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,399
Seven candidates are
involved in the cheating case.

139
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,920
Four of them are Mentor's disciples.

140
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,359
Mentor is in charge
of the examination too.

141
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,559
In that case,

142
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,160
Mentor is highly suspicious

143
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,720
of leaking the questions.

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,959
Baili has given me a tough challenge.

145
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,279
If I choose to protect Official Pei,

146
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,640
she'll accuse me
of pursuing my personal interests

147
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,519
and dismissing the law
through the officials.

148
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,399
If I give up on Official Pei,

149
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,119
many would be disappointed in me.

150
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,959
What are your plans then,

151
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,640
Your Highness?

152
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,399
Father will certainly
send someone to investigate

153
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,640
the cheating incident
during the morning court tomorrow.

154
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,480
I will make the necessary arrangements.

155
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,160
Meanwhile...

156
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,799
I hope you can help me

157
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,799
to get the job, Minister Feng.

158
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,279
But didn't you say that

159
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,359
if you save Official Pei,

160
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,399
you'll get involved in this controversy?

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,079
Even if you managed
to save Official Pei,

162
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,000
His Lordship wouldn't
be happy about this

163
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,399
and might be displeased with you.

164
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,720
Indeed, they have set me

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
in a splendid trap.

166
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,600
But must I

167
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,279
fall into this trap as they wish?

168
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,720
I've ordered Pei Youshuo,

169
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,359
Yan Shizhang,

170
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,720
and Wang Liangde
to supervise the examination

171
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,160
to prevent such incidents.

172
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,160
However, the biggest cheating case

173
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,760
in Yong's history has happened.

174
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,119
This is unbelievable.

175
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,559
The Royal Army
has surrounded the Examination Hall.

176
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,920
The three examiners
are held in confinement there.

177
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,040
The candidates involved in the
cheating case are taken into custody.

178
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,760
The truth will be revealed

179
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,520
under interrogation.

180
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,440
Do you really think

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,119
that this is just
a simple cheating case?

182
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,760
Spill the beans.

183
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,679
You won't be punished.

184
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,559
Okay.

185
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,119
I've read

186
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,479
the answer sheets of
the candidates involved.

187
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,320
Their answers didn't match
the answers on the cheat sheet.

188
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,479
Especially for
Feng Shiying and Song Sihan.

189
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,479
In my opinion,

190
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,039
their answers

191
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,520
are even better
than the answers on the cheat sheet.

192
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,880
Why are you here?

193
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,960
Did you lose contact with my dad?

194
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:20,520
I didn't tell her.

195
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
It doesn't matter.

196
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,840
Listen,

197
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
did you lose contact with my dad?

198
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,760
Yes.

199
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,119
After we arrived at the capital of Yongzhou,

200
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,239
I sent Master a letter thrice
with his carrier pigeon

201
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,520
but to no avail.

202
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,679
What happened to my dad?

203
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,520
No worries.

204
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,080
Master is cautious.

205
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,880
He will be okay.

206
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,359
That's easy for you to say.

207
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,840
Why would my dad

208
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,719
lose contact out of the blue?

209
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,559
I've asked for Hei Fengxi's help.

210
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,799
He has sent someone to look for him.

211
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,479
Let's calm down

212
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,840
and wait for his news.

213
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,359
Wait?

214
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,559
How much longer will we have to wait?

215
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,640
You simply didn't want
to look for Master.

216
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,280
You wanted Master to die so badly

217
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:54,000
so that you can be the next Leader.

218
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,760
Is this your conspiracy?

219
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,159
We all know who's behind the conspiracy.

220
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,760
You knew that we'd
lost contact with Master,

221
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,599
but you hid the news from us.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,919
What are you trying to do?

223
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,080
I hid the news from you?

224
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,799
What can you do then,
if I inform you about it?

225
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,520
Are you going
to worry about it together?

226
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,080
You're the one

227
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,919
who should be worrying about this.

228
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,679
They say women are cruel.

229
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,599
You can do anything

230
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,840
just to be the Leader.

231
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,440
What's wrong?

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,719
Are you feeling ashamed now?

233
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,239
Gu Yu,

234
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,239
I believe
that she isn't someone like that.

235
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,239
We all know what Martial Sister is like.

236
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,960
Never judge a book by its cover.

237
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:28,760
Great.

238
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,440
Very well.

239
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,799
Never judge a book by its cover.

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,599
Gu Yu.

241
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,640
Brothers and sisters.

242
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,719
Listen to me.

243
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,919
I, Bai Fengxi,
never want to be the Leader.

244
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,320
No matter in the past or present,

245
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,799
and even the future.

246
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:48,640
Where are you going?

247
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,119
I'm going to look for my dad.

248
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,200
Where are you going to look for him?

249
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,479
It's none of your business.

250
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,000
Take her back to her room to rest.

251
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:58,719
Yes.

252
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,359
Be careful.

253
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,359
Although I'm not the Leader,

254
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,719
Master has given me the authority.

255
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,119
You must not act recklessly.

256
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,359
Stay here

257
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,239
and wait for his news.

258
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,239
About what happened today,

259
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,119
we'll talk about it
after Master has returned.

260
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,840
If you dare to make trouble again,

261
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll show you no mercy.

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,280
We'll listen to you.

263
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,799
You can go back now.

264
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,119
Okay.

265
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,000
Where are you, Master?

266
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:50,261
(Mount Wu)

267
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,239
Who are you?

268
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,440
Bai Jiande of Tianshuang Sect.

269
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
You're Master Bai!

270
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,599
Greetings, I'm Wu Rui of Diheng Branch.

271
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,599
Did you happen to meet

272
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,119
Wang Shuilong of Wanjian Manor?

273
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:07,840
Warrior Wang?

274
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,520
He was with us when we entered Mount Wu.

275
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,479
But we went our separate ways then.

276
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,400
He's really in Mount Wu.

277
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,359
Why did you

278
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,479
come to Mount Wu then?

279
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Aren't you here

280
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,359
for Old Taiyin's inheritance as well?

281
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,119
I'm here to look for Wang Shuilong.

282
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,520
We agreed to meet at Wanjian Manor.

283
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,640
But when I arrived at Wanjian Manor,

284
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
he departed to Mount Wu instead.

285
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,679
Old Taiyin has sent
a notice to all heroes.

286
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,200
He's looking for an heir
to his ultimate skill, Sacred Jade Moon.

287
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,239
That's why we're here.

288
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,479
Oh, I see.

289
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,479
Thank you.

290
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,320
I shall get going then.

291
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:42,880
Goodbye.

292
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,359
I'm sure that you've
heard about the incident

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,320
at the Examination Hall.

294
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,359
How could such a thing

295
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,840
happen in Yong?

296
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,159
I would like to ask all of you.

297
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,960
What were you doing?

298
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,520
Why has Yong

299
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,400
turned into this state?

300
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,320
What do you think about this?

301
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,599
Tell me.

302
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,960
You're staying silent.

303
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,359
Do you want me to tell you myself?

304
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,000
I plead guilty, Your Lordship.

305
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,239
Could you only

306
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,359
apologize and do nothing?

307
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,880
You're pleading guilty in court.

308
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,799
Are you asking me to

309
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,919
admit my guilt to the public?

310
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,880
No, Your Lordship.

311
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,599
The cheating case

312
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,159
involved all three ministries

313
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,679
as well as the Senior Secretary.

314
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,880
We dare not to jump to a conclusion.

315
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,919
You squabbled about

316
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,479
trivial matters every day.

317
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,679
Now you dare not to discuss this.

318
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,320
I've appointed you

319
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,799
to solve problems.

320
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,359
Is this your solution?

321
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,119
Please punish me
for my incompetence, Your Lordship.

322
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,239
Please punish us
for our incompetence, Your Lordship.

323
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,599
Your Lordship.

324
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,159
I have an idea.

325
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,200
Go ahead.

326
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:13,599
I think that

327
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,919
Prince Yongping

328
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
can be assigned
to investigate the matter.

329
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,280
Why?

330
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,239
The examination intends
to appoint capable candidates

331
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,679
to serve the Royal Family

332
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,400
and the country.

333
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,400
This matter is complicated

334
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,440
and affects the Royal Family's image.

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,479
Hence,

336
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,960
it's better to assign
a Royal member to solve the case.

337
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,280
Prince Chang and Prince Ju
haven't gotten a title yet.

338
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,640
Prince Yongping is
the most suitable candidate.

339
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,599
I second that!

340
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,440
I second that!

341
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,039
I second that!

342
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,479
I second that!

343
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,320
I second that as well.

344
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,479
Prince Yongping,

345
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,719
what do you think about this?

346
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,479
I'm willing to solve the problem
for Your Lordship.

347
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,000
Well.

348
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,280
Prince Yongping,

349
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,960
you must work with Ministry of Justice
and Ministry of Civil Service Affairs

350
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,400
to solve the cheating case

351
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,919
in seven days.

352
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,559
Noted, Your Lordship.

353
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,599
Dismiss.

354
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Long live the Lord.

355
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,200
This incident is obviously

356
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,280
targeted at him.

357
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,919
But he takes the initiative
to fall into the trap.

358
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,679
Well,

359
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:35,880
is he a fool or
is he pretending to be one?

360
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,679
Prince Lanxi is smart indeed.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,200
He thinks that he's smart,

362
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,719
but he might be hoisted
by his own petard.

363
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,159
Your Lordship, the Minister of Justice,
Zhang Zhongge is here.

364
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,760
Let him in.

365
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,960
Greetings, Your Lordship.

366
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,760
(Minister of Justice, Zhang Zhongge)
Long live the Lord.

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,559
Never mind the formalities.

368
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,039
Thank you, Your Lordship.

369
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,119
Zhongge.

370
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,719
We've known each other
for the longest time.

371
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,520
I trust you the most.

372
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,880
Do you know why

373
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,000
I assigned you to
the Ministry of Justice?

374
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,039
Your Lordship,

375
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,719
the Ministry of Justice is
in charge of punishment

376
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,799
and keeping the country in order.

377
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,719
You assigned me to lead the Ministry,

378
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,840
as you hope that I can

379
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,559
maintain Yong's national law.

380
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,159
You're right.

381
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,440
I put the public order of my country

382
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,080
in the hands of my most trusted man.

383
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,239
Although I ordered Prince Yongping
to lead the investigation,

384
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,840
the cheating case

385
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,359
is still under your charge.

386
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,960
Do keep that in mind.

387
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,640
Noted, Your Lordship.

388
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,520
Prince Yongping has little experience

389
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,039
in investigating cases.

390
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,520
When the time is right,

391
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,679
you have to step up

392
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,039
and make the decision.

393
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
This investigation

394
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,479
not only represents our national law

395
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,839
and our country,

396
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,800
it represents me as well.

397
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,239
Noted, Your Lordship.

398
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,959
I shall leave this to you then.

399
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,359
I'm worried about Master too.

400
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,959
If I know about his whereabouts,

401
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,400
no matter where it is,

402
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
I will bring you to look for him.

403
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,359
But Master's whereabouts are unknown.

404
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,040
We can't simply look for him
all over the place.

405
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,479
We should wait for the news
from Fountain Abode.

406
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,199
That's easy for you to say.

407
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,119
He isn't your dad.

408
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,880
Langhua.

409
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,640
A Master for a day is
a father for a lifetime.

410
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,040
Deep down,

411
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,160
I take Master as my father.

412
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you know that Master
worried a lot about you?

413
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,280
You haven't fully recovered,

414
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,160
yet you're throwing tantrums.

415
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
If anything happens to you,

416
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,719
Master would be upset when he's back.

417
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,800
Why did you hide the truth from us then?

418
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,359
I didn't hide the truth from you.

419
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,199
I simply didn't want this to happen.

420
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,839
You haven't fully recovered.

421
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,319
I'm afraid that you may
be overly emotional

422
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,439
and fall sick again.

423
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,400
Did you really do that for me?

424
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,280
I know that you're worried about Master.

425
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,760
I promise that

426
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,800
I will find him for sure.

427
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,439
Gu Yu detests me.

428
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,560
Hence, he tried to
drive a wedge between us yesterday.

429
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:47,920
Langhua.

430
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,479
Master put his heart and
soul into Tianshuang Sect.

431
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,160
We must protect it while he's away.

432
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,000
I need you

433
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,280
to protect Tianshuang Sect with me.

434
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,359
Can Fountain Abode find my dad?

435
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't worry.

436
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
We'll certainly get news
about Master's whereabouts

437
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,560
in a few days.

438
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,520
I'll trust you this time.

439
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,520
All right.

440
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:12,920
Come on.

441
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,880
Come on, slowly.

442
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:22,439
Are you hungry?

443
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,040
I'll get you some food.

444
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,199
Don't forget to take your medicine.

445
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,064
(Ministry of Justice, Yongzhou)

446
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,560
I, Candidate Xu Yuxin, greet you sirs.

447
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,359
The cheating case

448
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,160
has caused a stir.

449
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,800
You must confess

450
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:56,880
truthfully.

451
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,959
I will confess everything I know.

452
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,719
Do you still remember
the look of the broker?

453
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,400
I've only seen him once.

454
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
I couldn't recall.

455
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,520
You're lying.

456
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,400
I dare not to lie.

457
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:15,959
Very well.

458
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,640
Then,

459
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,839
what is the price of the cheat sheet?

460
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,880
He...

461
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
He asked for a hundred silver leaves.

462
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,520
The deposit is half the full price.

463
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,760
You're from Juancheng.

464
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,959
Your father is a petty official.

465
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,640
Your family isn't wealthy.

466
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,839
You've only brought along
a hundred silver leaves

467
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,400
to the capital of Yongzhou.

468
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,000
You don't seem like a fool.

469
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,359
Why would you believe in a broker?

470
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,280
Because...

471
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,880
Because...

472
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,119
Because...

473
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,479
Because you knew from the start

474
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,680
that the cheat sheet contained
leaked answers for the examination.

475
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,920
So, you bought the cheat sheet
even if it would cost you a fortune.

476
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,280
You know Yong's law well.

477
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,560
If you cheated,

478
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,280
you'd only be prohibited
to join the examination for three years.

479
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:59,160
But if you're involved in examination
leakage, you'll be sentenced to death.

480
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,760
So, you dare not to admit this.

481
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Please spare my life, Prince Yongping.

482
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
I was blinded by greed

483
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
and acted foolishly.

484
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,160
How did you know
that it's the leaked answers?

485
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,880
Because...

486
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,760
The questions that the broker showed me

487
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,920
were written on gold foil paper.

488
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,040
Gold foil paper?

489
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,880
Only officials ranked
above the Third Rank

490
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,959
are allowed to use it.

491
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,199
How could a mere broker

492
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,160
use it?

493
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,520
I don't believe

494
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,239
that you couldn't remember his look.

495
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,119
I'm assigned by His Lordship
to investigate the cheating incident.

496
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Please

497
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:56,640
explain the situation to me.

498
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,760
Okay.

499
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,359
I'll go first.

500
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,800
Please have a look, Your Highness.

501
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:15,560
On the day of the examination,

502
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,479
I took the examination paper
out of the cabinet.

503
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,280
They were with me as well.

504
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,880
When I took out the examination paper,

505
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,800
the envelope was sealed.

506
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,000
I checked it

507
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,040
before I took out
the examination paper from the envelope.

508
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:34,173
(Thirty-first year of Chunxi's reign.)

509
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:35,863
(Royal Examination.
Ways to promote peace.)

510
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,560
The Royal Seal is valid too.

511
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,199
If that's the case,

512
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
before the examination started,

513
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,560
you were the only ones

514
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,560
who knew the questions.

515
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
You can say so.

516
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,199
You can be frank
with us, Official Zhang.

517
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,520
One of us

518
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,199
leaked the examination questions.

519
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,760
However, our careers
and lives are on the line.

520
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,119
I hope that you can

521
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,280
prove our innocence with evidence.

522
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:14,359
Rest assured, Duke of Liang.

523
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,160
I will not wrong a good man.

524
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,760
I will also not

525
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,439
let off a bad man.

526
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,959
The Ministry of Civil Service Affairs

527
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,160
should have the usage record
of the gold foil paper.

528
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,719
Please

529
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:29,880
check if anyone

530
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,599
involved in the examination
could get their hands

531
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,560
on the gold foil paper.

532
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,439
Check where the gold foil paper goes too.

533
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,599
All right.

534
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,079
Also, check the list of workers and
Ministry of Works officials involved in

535
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,599
renovating the Examination Hall.

536
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:43,760
Pass the list to
the Ministry of Justice.

537
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:47,920
In terms of interrogation,

538
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,319
I am no match for Official Zhang.

539
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,599
I shall leave this to you.

540
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,680
Rest assured, Prince Yongping.
I'll do my best.

541
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,400
Official.

542
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,479
The artist has sketched
the broker's portrait

543
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,199
based on the description
provided by Xu Yuxin.

544
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:10,560
What?

545
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,079
Five silver leaves?

546
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,680
Gu Yu.

547
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,640
Are you out of your mind?

548
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,280
You owe us 20 silver leaves.

549
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,479
20 silver leaves?

550
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,239
I only borrowed five silver leaves.

551
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:24,079
That's the loan.

552
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,359
What about the interest?

553
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,760
Gu Yu.

554
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,239
If you want me to extend the deadline,

555
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,079
that's possible too.

556
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,479
But

557
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,119
you'd need to pay me 30 silver leaves.

558
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,439
Would you be able to afford it?

559
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:36,920
This is a scam.

560
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,199
So?

561
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,680
Are you trying to repudiate your debt?

562
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,920
Listen, Gu Yu.

563
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,520
You signed your name
on the promissory note.

564
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,479
I'm not even afraid

565
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,920
if you go to the court.

566
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,560
You...

567
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,400
Do you want to hit me?

568
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,719
Come on then.

569
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:52,719
Hit me.

570
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,920
However, you must

571
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,359
pay for my medical fee then.

572
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,359
Gu Yu.

573
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,719
What's the matter?

574
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,959
This is

575
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,160
none of your business.

576
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,079
None of my business?

577
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,640
Do you have the money to pay him?

578
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,000
You're the head of the Sect, aren't you?

579
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,599
You seem like a reasonable person.

580
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,959
If he returns my money today,

581
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,199
I'll let him go.

582
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,359
Otherwise,

583
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,760
I'll bring him to the court.

584
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,280
How much does he owe you?

585
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,239
He lost all his money
while gambling at Xifeng Casino.

586
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,680
Then, he borrowed money from us.

587
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,359
He owes us 20 silver leaves
including the interest.

588
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,760
Gu Yu.

589
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,199
Have you forgotten about the Sect Rules?

590
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,680
Tell him, Jiurong.

591
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,000
The third Sect Rule.

592
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,000
We should

593
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,959
never feast, drink excessively,
visit prostitutes, and gamble.

594
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,199
If you carry out any of the actions,

595
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,520
a mild offender will be punished
to reflect for ten days in isolation.

596
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,520
The serious offender

597
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,520
will be kicked out of the Sect
and his martial art will be withdrawn.

598
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,479
Do you remember it now?

599
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,599
Since you're a first offender,

600
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,880
you'll be punished to
reflect for ten days in isolation.

601
00:25:59,239 --> 00:25:59,959
Bai Fengxi.

602
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,520
You're not the Leader yet.

603
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,680
Stop threatening me with the Sect Rules.

604
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,800
Even if I am to be punished,

605
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,319
that is Master's right to do so.

606
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,040
You...

607
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,040
Excuse me.

608
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,760
I don't care about the punishment.

609
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,199
All I want is money.

610
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,040
This is

611
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,160
none of your business.

612
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,079
Don't worry.

613
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,119
I'll give you the money

614
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,959
by the end of the day.

615
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,439
Good.

616
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,239
Be a man of your words then.

617
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I'll wait for you

618
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,199
at A8 Yangliu Street, West District.

619
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,400
Do you really want to be a gambler?

620
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,079
Gu Yu.

621
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,280
Follow him, Jiurong.

622
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,439
Don't let him get into trouble.

623
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,079
Okay.

624
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,719
Who is it? Come in.

625
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,439
Aren't you the lady from Gu Yu's place?

626
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,079
This is the capital.

627
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,359
I've cleared the debt.

628
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,119
What about the interest?

629
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,400
I don't have it.

630
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,959
Well, this won't do.

631
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,520
If you don't have enough money,

632
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,800
you can pay with something else.

633
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,599
Well.

634
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,199
What can I pay
in place of the interest?

635
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:27,079
Well, you have a nice figure

636
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:28,880
and you're good-looking too.

637
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,640
You should be worth some money.

638
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,560
Ouch!

639
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,959
Yong's Royal Law has stated that

640
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,160
personal loan is prohibited.

641
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,479
Do you know that

642
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,800
if I report this to an official,

643
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,239
who will be the unlucky one?

644
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,680
Me.

645
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,040
Bring me the promissory note.

646
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:48,119
Okay.

647
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,839
Okay.

648
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,199
I'll give it to you.

649
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:04,640
Run.

650
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,479
Run if you dare.

651
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,959
I'll ask you one last time.

652
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,000
Are you going to bring me
the promissory note or not?

653
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,199
I don't have the promissory note.

654
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,359
Stop.

655
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,520
Why are you here?

656
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I am going to ask you this.

657
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,560
Why are you here?

658
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,280
Gu Yu borrowed money from him.

659
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,599
I'm here to return him the money

660
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,560
and retrieve the promissory note.

661
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:30,880
Are you

662
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,439
asking for the note like this?

663
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:33,839
Of course.

664
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,160
I'll settle the promissory note for you.

665
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,439
Where's the promissory note?

666
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,599
It's not with me.

667
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,359
It's with Third Master Wu.

668
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Third Master Wu?

669
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,680
The leader of the local bullies.

670
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:54,880
He's the boss of Xifeng Casino

671
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,800
and a few brothels.

672
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:56,760
Take him away.

673
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:57,439
Yes.

674
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,280
I'll get the promissory note for you.

675
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Thanks so much.

676
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:46,199
I think I got the flour

677
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,359
on my face earlier.

678
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,959
I've got to go.

679
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,079
(Why does he always show up)

680
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,079
(when I'm in trouble?)

681
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,800
(Is he following me?)

682
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,680
(He can go anywhere)

683
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,560
(in the capital of Yongzhou.)

684
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,040
(Who is he?)

685
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,239
Official.

686
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,119
Official.

687
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,199
I know that
it's illegal to give personal loans.

688
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,640
But I'm just a mere broker

689
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:26,719
earning a little commission.

690
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,400
I beg for your mercy.

691
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,599
There's no need to lock you up

692
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,839
in the Ministry of Justice due
to the offense of giving personal loans.

693
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,199
What do you mean, Official?

694
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,800
Tell me about
how you sell the examination questions.

695
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,119
Examination questions?

696
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,760
I'm innocent, Official.

697
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,280
I am illiterate.

698
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,760
I sell the cheat sheet

699
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,439
under the order of Third Master Wu.

700
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,040
I am innocent, Official.

701
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:50,319
Chuanyun, Chuanyu.

702
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,160
Bring me Third Master Wu.

703
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,040
Okay.

704
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,560
Official Zhang is here.

705
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:01,959
Official Zhang.

706
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,199
Greetings, Your Highness.

707
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,719
You must be tired

708
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,280
from the investigation.

709
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,719
I'm doing it for Father.

710
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,680
I'll enter the palace later

711
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,920
to inform His Lordship

712
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,239
about the findings of the investigation.

713
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,199
You're frail.

714
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,880
You should go back and rest.

715
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,680
I shall settle the rest of the matter.

716
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,160
Thank you, Official Zhang.

717
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,719
Goodbye, Your Highness.

718
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,920
Your Highness.

719
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,880
Why did you choose to leave

720
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,479
at such a critical period?

721
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,520
When listening to others,

722
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,160
you must listen
to the underlying message.

723
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,760
Official Zhang said
that he would inform Father.

724
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,160
The one who wants me
to leave isn't him then.

725
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,839
Father knows about this.

726
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,800
This relates to the struggle for power.

727
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,439
I'm

728
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,000
in the middle of the struggle.

729
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,079
Are we going back to the residence then?

730
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Let's go to Pagoda Tree Estate.

731
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,040
Okay.

732
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,199
Come on.

733
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,800
Catch it.

734
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,400
Come on, hurry up.

735
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,599
Here you go.

736
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:22,880
She's here.

737
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,119
Martial Sister.

738
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:30,760
Martial Sister is here.

739
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,599
You're really brave.

740
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,280
How dare you sneak up on me!

741
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,959
I'll teach you a lesson today.

742
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,079
Come on.

743
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:48,920
Pass it to me.

744
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:55,800
Your Highness.

745
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,119
You're here at short notice.

746
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
We haven't tidied up the estate yet.

747
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,520
It's okay.

748
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,800
Tidy up my bedroom first.

749
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:06,959
All right.

750
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,040
What are they doing?

751
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,599
Why is it chaotic?

752
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,479
She's so good at this.

753
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,119
Pass it to me.

754
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:17,719
My turn.

755
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:24,640
Watch out.

756
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,119
Stop the ball.

757
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:25,599
Over here.

758
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:46,400
You can either kick the ball back to us

759
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,719
or join us.

760
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,800
Are you inviting me
to play Cuju with you?

761
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,439
So far

762
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,920
I haven't met
any worthy opponent in Cuju.

763
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,760
Don't be too proud.

764
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,880
Let's have a match.

765
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,319
Sure.

766
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:02,760
Well,

767
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:03,959
I

768
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,959
never make a deal with no rewards.

769
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,560
If you want to play Cuju with me,

770
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,159
there must be a reward.

771
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,560
Okay.

772
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,600
Let's have a best-of-one.

773
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,800
If you score this ball,

774
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,760
you win.

775
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,399
If you lose,

776
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,040
you shall cook us dinner.

777
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,840
You little Black Foxy.

778
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
I've known you for years,

779
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,120
yet you've only cooked for me once.

780
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,159
You should reflect on yourself.

781
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,199
But it made you

782
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,639
crave for it ever since.

783
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,840
If I win,

784
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,719
I can make any request to you.

785
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,560
Deal.

786
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,080
It's Prince Lanxi.

787
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:06,879
Well.

788
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,879
Your Highness.

789
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,840
Your Highness.

790
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,399
They're not playing Cuju.

791
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,120
What are they doing then?

792
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,560
They're flirting with each other.

793
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,919
Whenever Young Master sees Miss Feng,

794
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,560
he's like a different man.

795
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:02,959
Bravo!

796
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,199
What does this count then?

797
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,719
That's right.

798
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
It's a tie, of course.

799
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,199
A tie?

800
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,919
All right.

801
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:15,560
We played Cuju.

802
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,679
Clean up

803
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,560
and prepare for dinner.

804
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,040
Okay.

805
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:19,840
Let's go.

806
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,280
Yes, let's go.

807
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,360
Come on.

808
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
I saw that you were
in a hurry previously.

809
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,479
Something must have happened.

810
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,199
Did you manage to solve it?

811
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,479
It's just the beginning.

812
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,479
I'm here today

813
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,239
to pass you something.

814
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:44,379
(I, Gu Yu, promise to pay Bai Laoqi
five silver leaves in three months.)

815
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:49,080
Sir.

816
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,840
I'm rather busy.

817
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,719
I shall get going then.

818
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,120
When I'm done with work,

819
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,080
I shall cook you a meal.

820
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,080
Okay, I'll wait for it.

821
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,840
I should be happy,

822
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,280
seeing that Lanxi is healthy now.

823
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,239
But I still feel down.

824
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,919
Uncle De.

825
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,600
What else is Lanxi

826
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
hiding from me?

827
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,600
Prince Lanxi

828
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,719
must have

829
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,919
his own reasons.

830
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,479
He has his own reasons.

831
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:48,840
I first realized
that he was hiding something from me

832
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,239
at the Hot Spring Palace.

833
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,120
Although I didn't know where he went,

834
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
I wouldn't allow Feng Ju to harm him.

835
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,719
Hence, I backed up his lie.

836
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,000
During the autumn hunt,

837
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,399
he gave me a big surprise.

838
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,479
But seeing that he has gotten capable

839
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,919
and received Father's recognition,

840
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,439
I felt happy for him.

841
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,199
But he shouldn't lie
to me about his health.

842
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,760
(Integrity and honesty)
According to Wu Peng's confession,

843
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,159
also known as

844
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,320
Third Master Wu,

845
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,000
the one who provided him
with the answers

846
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,879
should be the chief butler
of Duke of Liang's Residence.

847
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,479
I've sent someone

848
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,479
to arrest the chief butler.

849
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,520
Please lead the interrogation,
Prince Yongping.

850
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,879
I've also sent my men
to Duke of Liang's Residence

851
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,560
to check on the stock count
of the gold foil paper.

852
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,199
Compared with the record
in Ministry of Civil Service Affairs,

853
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,360
they're short of
one piece of gold foil paper.

854
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
I questioned Duke of Liang
about it at the Examination Hall,

855
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,199
but he said that

856
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,280
it happened a long time ago.

857
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
So, he couldn't remember
where the gold foil paper went.

858
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,719
Interrogate the chief butler of
Duke of Liang's Residence now.

859
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:55,479
Besides,

860
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,439
continue to examine
the residences of Wu Peng and the others

861
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,520
just in case the missing
gold foil paper is with them.

862
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,479
Okay.

863
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,479
Your Lordship.

864
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,280
We've conducted investigations
on the cheating case

865
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,600
and we have some findings.

866
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,239
Through investigation,

867
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,360
the person behind the cheating case

868
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,719
is Duke of Liang.

869
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,280
Do you have evidence?

870
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:16,719
According to the investigations,

871
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,679
the butler of Duke of Liang's Residence
has admitted

872
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,560
that Duke of Liang
leaked the answers to him.

873
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,199
He then passed it
to the local bully, Wu Peng

874
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,120
under the order of Duke of Liang

875
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:27,320
to pretend to sell
the leaked examination questions.

876
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,000
Pretend to sell?

877
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:30,600
What do you mean?

878
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,479
It is verified by Official Zhang
that only three of the candidates

879
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,679
among the seven candidates involved

880
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,600
had a deal with the broker.

881
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,000
The four other candidates
are being framed.

882
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,479
All four of them

883
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,919
are the disciples of
Senior Secretary, Pei Youshuo.

884
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,959
I've found the gold foil paper

885
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,280
at the broker's place.

886
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,199
The handwriting on the paper

887
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,879
matches Duke of Liang's handwriting.

888
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,280
Moreover,

889
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,479
we've examined
Duke of Liang's Residence.

890
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,719
We found
that there's a missing gold foil paper

891
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,560
at Duke of Liang's Residence.

892
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,639
Since the testimony
and evidence are pointing toward him,

893
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,320
well...

894
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,120
Objection, Your Lordship.

895
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,879
What is it, Official Wang?

896
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,159
The evidence

897
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,120
is fake.

898
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,520
The missing gold foil paper
in Duke of Liang's Residence

899
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,600
is with me.

900
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:47,800
Yuan Lu.

901
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,919
The legitimate daughter
of Duke of Liang, Yan,

902
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
has been serving the Queen

903
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:57,959
and growing up with Prince Ju.

904
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:01,800
(Please do me a favor.)
Hence, Duke of Liang wrote me a letter.

905
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,320
He hoped that I can
propose to Your Lordship

906
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,479
to grant their marriage.

907
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,600
I wanted to inform
Your Lordship about this

908
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,919
after the royal court session.

909
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,959
I didn't expect that Prince Yongping

910
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:19,159
would prove Duke of Liang guilty
of this.

911
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:22,560
So, I had to present the letter.

912
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,040
About the handwriting,

913
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,560
Duke of Liang's
handwriting isn't that prominent.

914
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,159
It's easy to imitate it.

915
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,639
Prince Yongping.

916
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,280
What is this?

917
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,399
I have no idea.

918
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,080
Prince Yongping said that

919
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,760
an official is falsely accused.

920
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,199
Who is the one

921
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,080
accusing people falsely now?

922
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,000
Pei Youshuo is Minister Feng's mentor.

923
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,000
Prince Yongping is
close with Minister Feng.

924
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,679
In order to protect Official Pei,

925
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,760
they accuse Duke of Liang falsely.

926
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,159
What a brilliant scheme,
Prince Yongping.

927
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,959
Please order a retrial, Your Lordship.

928
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,919
I second that!

929
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I second that!

930
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:14,520
I second that!

931
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,439
I second that!
