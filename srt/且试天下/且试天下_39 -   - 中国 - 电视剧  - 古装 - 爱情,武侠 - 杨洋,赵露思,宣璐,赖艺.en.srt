20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,879
What did you bring me here for, Mr. Yu?

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,519
If I hadn't stopped you
from sending troops,

22
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,760
what would you have done?

23
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,919
Of course I would pretend to
help the Shangzhou and Beizhou

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,000
to resist the Jizhou and Yongzhou

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,199
and then consolidate my forces
to crush the rebels.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,120
What would be the chances of winning?

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,839
Thirty percent.

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,519
You really know what you're doing.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,639
Now,

30
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,320
it's less than 10%.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't worry.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,320
I have a plan.

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,320
(Chengze Gate)

34
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,324
(Chengze Gate)

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,279
Who are all these people?

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,119
These are my secretly trained
Divine Forces.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,919
Divine Forces?

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,279
A very dominating name.

39
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,590
(Chengze Gate)
I didn't know

40
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:51,440
you could train an army.

41
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,559
Give it a try.

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,559
- Okay.
- You go and try them out.

43
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,279
Yes.

44
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,270
(Chengze Gate)

45
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,320
That's too few.

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,240
How about having three teams
attack them together?

47
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,440
How cocky.

48
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,919
Then, I'll give you

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,440
a taste of failure.

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,520
You,

51
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:17,680
(Chengze Gate)

52
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,520
attack them together.

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,039
Yes.

54
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,360
These weapons are from the Tie family.

55
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,559
This is the Xuanyuan family's
Iron Gyro Formation.

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
Stop it now. Stop it.

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,800
Stop it. Stop it now.

58
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,880
These Divine Forces...

59
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,679
How many men do you have?

60
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,759
A hundred thousand.

61
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,039
A hundred thousand?

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,320
I wonder

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
what you think your chances are now.

64
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,799
Seventy percent.

65
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,359
But I think the chances of winning

66
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,679
with my plan

67
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,119
are a hundred percent.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,920
I was wrong about you before.

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,920
I hope you won't take it personally.

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,480
You are dedicated to Dadong Empire.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,559
You don't need to feel sorry.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you and I,
a general and a strategist,

73
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,480
work together,

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,160
we will be able to win every battle

75
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,519
for Dadong Empire.

76
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,959
Sir.

77
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,640
Is the plan going well?

78
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,239
After this battle,

79
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,480
the winner will be determined.

80
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,839
According to your plan,

81
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,880
the Yongzhou and Jizhou leaders

82
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,799
will enter the Realm of the Kings
in a few days.

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,399
Given their personalities,

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,959
they would have fought to the death

85
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,279
before entering the Imperial City.

86
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,440
No matter who wins,
it's going to be a tough win.

87
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,480
So, we just sit back and ride it out.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
This is called an obvious conspiracy.

89
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,040
So, we just sit back
and watch the fight?

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,679
In this world,

91
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,559
when there is an obvious conspiracy,
there is a hidden conspiracy.

92
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,359
I have prepared a good show

93
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,880
for Lord of Yongzhou
and Queen of Qingzhou.

94
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,160
Well,

95
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,279
what about

96
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,720
Huang Chao?

97
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,119
I know Huang Chao best.

98
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,720
He values trust above all else.

99
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,279
He would never forgive me

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,760
if he knew I have done such a thing.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,679
So if we spare him,

102
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,359
there will be endless trouble.

103
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,679
I got it.

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,559
(Yongzhou Royal Palace)
Now that the situation is better known.

105
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,799
Emperor Jing Yan has issued an imperial edict
for the recruitment of sages.

106
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,959
I want to enter the Realm of the Kings.

107
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,480
What do you think?

108
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,119
According to the current situation,
we'll definitely support Your Lordship.

109
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,000
Your Lordship,

110
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,000
I think Huang Chao of Jizhou
has the same idea.

111
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,399
Emperor Jing Yan's edict

112
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,000
is ostensibly a recruitment drive,

113
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,200
but in reality, he wants us
to compete with Huang Chao

114
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,040
so that he can fight one last time.

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,040
Your Lordship,

116
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,760
in my opinion, although Emperor Jing Yan
doesn't attend to political affairs,

117
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,239
there is still a veteran general

118
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,920
within the Imperial Family,
Dong Shufang.

119
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,799
This man is as capable as Lian Po.

120
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,200
We must not take him lightly.

121
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,000
Your Lordship,

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,679
however,

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,119
the Imperial Family only
has a total of 100,000 soldiers.

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,119
Even if he is powerful,

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,679
he must have troops
that can be deployed.

126
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,239
What do you think

127
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,519
of today's events?

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
The battle at the Realm of the King
is inevitable.

129
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,200
But what I'm most worried about right now

130
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,359
is Yu Wuyuan who has been
hiding behind all this time.

131
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,640
He's hiding in the dark

132
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,399
and we don't know what he's up to.

133
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,600
So it's better to be careful.

134
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:29,760
Yes.

135
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,679
The Finest Gentry has yet to appear.

136
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,880
But he has figured out

137
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,000
that even if I am wary of him,

138
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,200
the battle at the Realm of the Kings
is still inevitable.

139
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,839
So, this time,

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,920
what are your plans?

141
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,399
I want

142
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,200
Chuanyun and Chuanyu

143
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,760
to lead 100,000 men of the Moyu Cavalry

144
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,920
through Beizhou and Jiaocheng

145
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,160
to the Realm of the Kings.

146
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:54,559
Huang Chao will certainly
send his main force from Jizhou

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
to Yancheng.

148
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,359
After all, Jizhou is much closer to
the Realm of the Kings than Yongzhou,

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
so he wants to save time.

150
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,640
Exactly.

151
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:06,440
Besides, Moyu Cavalry and the troops
from Yongzhou and Beizhou

152
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,720
will be led by me and my Mentor

153
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,880
to break through the border
of Yongzhou and Shangzhou

154
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,079
to the Realm of the Kings.

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,839
This will create a wrap-around situation
for Huang Chao.

156
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,119
Then, my men from Qingzhou

157
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,519
will be left in Juancheng.

158
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,839
You are the one who knows me best.

159
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,559
Queen of Qingzhou, please lead
Fengyun Cavalry to conquer Juancheng.

160
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
When I fight with Huang Chao,

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,720
you can lead your men straight
to the Realm of the Kings.

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,039
No problem.

163
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Tomorrow, I'll take
Xu Yuan back to Qingzhou

164
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,599
to enumerate Fengyun Cavalry
and head straight for Juancheng.

165
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,520
Okay.

166
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,080
I'll be waiting for you
in the Imperial City.

167
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
After this battle,

168
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,159
peace will reign in the land.

169
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,440
Everyone,

170
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
will you support me
in my conquest of the world?

171
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,919
We obey Your Lordship's command.

172
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,799
Jizhou is closer to
the Realm of the Kings.

173
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,000
I will personally lead the troops
into the Realm of the Kings.

174
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm sure Feng Lanxi will figure out
what I'm planning to do.

175
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,679
Therefore,

176
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,880
he will definitely
intercept us at Dongdan.

177
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
The battle of Dongdan

178
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,159
is the key to the future.

179
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,200
Xuekong.

180
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:19,919
Yes, Your Lordship.

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,280
You lead your troops around Fucheng

182
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,919
to reach Dongdan first.

183
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,159
Yes.

184
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,159
Jiushuang.

185
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,640
(General of Jizhou, Qiu Jiushuang)
Yes, Your Lordship.

186
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Lead your troops to Jiaocheng.

187
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,760
To enter the Imperial City
from Yongzhou,

188
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,320
one must pass through Jiaocheng.

189
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,679
You need to be there to slow them down.

190
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,960
Yes, Your Lordship.

191
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,599
Where is Huang Yu?

192
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,080
She hasn't come back yet?

193
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,239
Hasn't.

194
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,479
Forget it.

195
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,359
It's not too late to look for her

196
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,159
after we enter the Realm of the Kings.

197
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,760
We must

198
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,679
win this battle!

199
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,760
Win this battle!

200
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,520
The scouts report
that the city ahead is empty.

201
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
There is no one at all.

202
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,640
The Imperial Family is depleted
and its forces are inadequate.

203
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,919
Your Lordship and Huang Chao both
advance into the Realm of the Kings.

204
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,520
I think Jing Yan is making a last resort

205
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,000
by pulling his troops back
to the Imperial City.

206
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,200
What about the people?

207
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,760
The people of the city
are nowhere to be seen.

208
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,640
What exactly is the purpose of Jing Yan?

209
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,760
Maybe it's not Jing Yan.

210
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,719
Yu Wuyuan.

211
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,919
What is he up to again?

212
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,200
Qiu Jiushuang is still quite competent.

213
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,320
It will take some time

214
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,840
to defeat her.

215
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Why have the provisions not yet arrived?

216
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,520
The provisions in the city are
less than five days of supplies left.

217
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
There is continuous
heavy rain in Mount Pa,

218
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,880
and there's also a mudslide on the road.

219
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,039
The provision wagons probably
couldn't get through that easily.

220
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,479
A starving soldier cannot win a battle.

221
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,239
If His Lordship's plans are ruined,

222
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,479
how will you and I be responsible?

223
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,400
I know.

224
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,640
But it will take at least eight days

225
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,599
for the road to be repaired.

226
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,400
According to the plan,

227
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,599
we should now be approaching
the Realm of the Kings.

228
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,880
The next target is Huocheng.

229
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:22,919
There are already

230
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,520
people from Jizhou in Huocheng.

231
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,599
If we march like this,

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,640
we'll be no match for Skyrider Cavalry.

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is there any other way?

234
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,960
Why don't we ask for provisions
from Queen of Qingzhou?

235
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,520
Anyway, before
conquering the Imperial City,

236
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,080
Fengyun Cavalry would be resting

237
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,200
and would not advance easily again.

238
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,520
We will proceed to Huocheng as planned.

239
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:40,960
That should be quick.

240
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
This is a good plan.

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,119
Send a letter immediately
to the Queen of Qingzhou to ask for help.

242
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,119
Qi Shu,

243
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,719
lead 3,000 men to escort

244
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,760
half of the city's provisions
to Moyu Cavalry.

245
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,640
Yes.

246
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,119
Xu Yuan,

247
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,760
lead 5,000 men
to Mount Pa to clear the road.

248
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,119
Yes.

249
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,119
Your Ladyship,

250
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,400
in the past few months of battle,

251
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,640
our army has lost nearly 1,000 men,

252
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,760
and more than 2,000 have been wounded,

253
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,679
although the casualties have been minor.

254
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,359
In addition to the garrison left behind

255
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,119
after the conquest of the cities,

256
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
there are now less than 30,000 men

257
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
in the city who can engage in battle.

258
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,000
The Moyu Cavalry has 200,000 soldiers.

259
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,880
Why can't they allocate 10,000 men

260
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,000
to transport provisions?

261
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,760
We'll have to rest here
until Lord of Yongzhou

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,840
conquers the Imperial City anyway,

263
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,200
so don't mind that.

264
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,239
Moreover,

265
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,159
I've been married to Lord of Yongzhou.

266
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,359
We are one as husband and wife

267
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,359
and there is no more need
to be calculative.

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,559
Yes.

269
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,400
Martial Sister,

270
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,599
according to the scouts,

271
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,880
the vanguard of Dong Shufang

272
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,640
is less than five days away
from Juancheng.

273
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,119
Dong Shufang is not on guard
at the Realm of the King,

274
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,400
and he is coming to Juancheng.

275
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,239
Emperor Jing Yan
really does have other plans.

276
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,239
Your Ladyship,

277
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,080
should we recall Xu Yuan and Qi Shu?

278
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:56,919
It's fine.

279
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,159
The most important thing now is

280
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,359
to protect the Yongzhou Army.

281
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,359
As for General Dong Shufang,

282
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,559
I would like to see

283
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,000
what this famous veteran general

284
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,280
is really like.

285
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,119
If so,

286
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,880
the walls of Juancheng are very low
and fragile, so it is weak in defense.

287
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:10,840
Besides,

288
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,479
half of the provisions in the city
have been sent away.

289
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,599
In this case,

290
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,640
this gives us

291
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,520
just enough to last 20 days.

292
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,400
Who says we have to
hang on to Juancheng?

293
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,359
Even though
General Dong Shufang is famous,

294
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,799
he hadn't set foot outside
the Imperial City for nearly a decade.

295
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,039
As juniors,

296
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,640
we should treat him with more courtesy

297
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,080
and welcome him from afar.

298
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,479
Lin Ji,

299
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,599
with the arrival of General Dong Shufang
in Juancheng,

300
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,760
there is certain to be
a battle in Juancheng.

301
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,239
The key to victory

302
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,760
lies with Moyu Cavalry.

303
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,799
Send a letter
to Lord of Yongzhou at once.

304
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,880
Fight immediately

305
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,760
to avoid turbulence.

306
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,320
Yes.

307
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,560
(Yongzhou, Qingzhou)

308
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,795
(Yicheng)

309
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,880
General, with the speed of our march,

310
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,679
we can reach Juancheng in three days.

311
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,239
The Divine Forces

312
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,000
are indeed prepared for war.

313
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:03,960
There's little need

314
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
for rest on the journey.

315
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,640
This is a knife for killing.

316
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,200
It is not yet known
in whose hands it will be held.

317
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,479
Where is General Luo at the moment?

318
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,400
Ten thousand soldiers in the vanguard
of the Imperial Army led by General Luo

319
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,599
are already half a day ahead

320
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,479
and less than a hundred li
away from Mount Luoying.

321
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,159
Contact with the vanguard

322
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,119
every two hours.

323
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,640
Yes.

324
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Your Ladyship,

325
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,919
except for about a thousand men
who had escaped,

326
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,440
Luo Lun and his Imperial Army

327
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,359
were completely wiped out.

328
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,799
What do we do next?

329
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:48,719
Juancheng is too small.

330
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,719
If 30,000 soldiers attack the city
with all their might,

331
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,080
with our strength,

332
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,000
the city will be invaded
in less than two days.

333
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,239
Moreover,

334
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,640
the people of Juancheng

335
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,039
have just recovered a little
from the last destruction of the city.

336
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,559
It would be too much to let them

337
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,880
experience the destruction
of the city and homes again

338
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,119
and to let innocent people

339
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,719
die in vain.

340
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,200
The final battle

341
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,679
is to be staged in Xiyuan.

342
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,400
I'll get ready now.

343
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,599
Report!

344
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:36,719
Your Lordship,

345
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,719
General Ren and the others are here.

346
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:38,760
Allow them to enter now.

347
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,440
Yes.

348
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,440
Greetings, Your Lordship.

349
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,359
You are three days ahead of schedule.

350
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,280
Xu Yuan, Qi Shu.

351
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,479
Greetings, Your Lordship.

352
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,440
Why are you here?

353
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,479
We are here on orders from our queen

354
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,239
to escort the provisions
for General Ren.

355
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,159
But the war is pressing,

356
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,760
so I asked the two generals to join us.

357
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,799
Only with the help of the two generals,

358
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,320
can we meet up with Your Lordship
ahead of schedule.

359
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,440
What about the situation in Juancheng?

360
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,239
With Queen of Qingzhou
and 30,000 soldiers of Fengyun Cavalry,

361
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,239
it shouldn't be a problem.

362
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,359
All right.

363
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,200
With the help
of General Xu and General Qi,

364
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,960
we will have more confidence

365
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,479
in our next battle with Huang Chao.

366
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,119
Report!

367
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,799
Your Lordship,
someone from Juancheng is here.

368
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:19,760
Allow him to enter.

369
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,479
Yes.

370
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,000
Greetings, Your Lordship.

371
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,520
My Queen sent me
to tell Your Lordship

372
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,760
that Dong Shufang
has led his men to Juancheng

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,840
and is not guarding
the Realm of the Kings.

374
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,280
There may be an ambush
in the Realm of the Kings.

375
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,440
Your Lordship must be careful.

376
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,760
What is the situation in Juancheng?

377
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:31,840
By the time I set out to get here,

378
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,039
Her Ladyship had already gone out

379
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,840
to wipe out 10,000 soldiers
of Luo Lun's Imperial Army vanguard.

380
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,320
I don't think Dong Shufang
is a match for Her Ladyship.

381
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,760
That's good then.

382
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
We need to speed up

383
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,960
to ease the crisis in Juancheng.

384
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,200
We will march into Dongdan tomorrow.

385
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,599
Yes.

386
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
General Luo Lun.

387
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,760
Pass on my order.

388
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,079
Set off for Xiyuan.

389
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,079
Yes.

390
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,400
We've all been waiting

391
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
for this battle for a long time,
haven't we?

392
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
This battle

393
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,439
has finally taken place.

394
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,640

Retreat.

464
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,800
Retreat!

465
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,160
Thirty thousand soldiers
of Fengyun Cavalry.

466
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,079
Twenty thousand men of the enemy.

467
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,680
We used most of our men

468
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,079
and only managed
to wipe out half their numbers.

469
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,280
Is it because we underestimated them?

470
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,319
How much manpower have we left?

471
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,839
After counting the number of wounded,

472
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,040
there are only

473
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,599
about 5,000 men left.

474
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,599
There's a great disparity in strength.

475
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280
A tough fight
would only increase casualties.

476
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,439
I think

477
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,239
their weapons and equipment are unusual.

478
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,400
Moreover, they are skilled
in their formations.

479
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,839
More to the point,

480
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,760
they recovered quickly
from their injuries.

481
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:15,680
It was as if they had taken
my family's secret medicine.

482
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,239
How did these people get their hands

483
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,640
on this secret recipe of the Han family?

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,719
Maybe it's because of Yu Wuyuan.

485
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
Yu Wuyuan?

486
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
All of their equipment
was well prepared for war.

487
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,119
Iron armors of the Xuanyuan family,

488
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,439
horses of the Ma family,

489
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,599
the armory of the Tie family,

490
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,199
and medicine of the Han family.

491
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
These were obtained by Yu Wuyuan
through the Soultaker Sect.

492
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:37,800
You mean

493
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,560
the one who attacked my family

494
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,280
was Yu Wuyuan?

495
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,239
He has lost his humanity
and caused chaos in the world.

496
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,880
I must take my revenge.

497
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,839
Vengeance must be avenged.

498
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,640
But the most urgent thing
at the moment is

499
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,959
how to win this battle.

500
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,839
It's strange.

501
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,560
They could have come up the mountain
and fought us to the death.

502
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,199
But they're just surrounding us now

503
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,239
to keep us from breaking out.

504
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,400
Maybe

505
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,640
they want to hold us back

506
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,119
to reduce casualties.

507
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,560
According to the time now,

508
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,640
Lin Ji should be arriving
at Dongdan soon.

509
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,000
Lanxi should soon receive

510
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,920
intel about the enemy.

511
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,800
May there be peace

512
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,119
and no more war

513
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,680
after this battle.

514
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,479
Martial Sister, what do you want to do

515
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,920
when the time comes?

516
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,319
Just like the old days,

517
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,239
find a farm and be a peasant woman.

518
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,199
Martial Sister,
you can never be a peasant woman.

519
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,680
I'm not that spoiled.

520
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,560
That's not what I mean.

521
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,920
I mean, you're lazy.

522
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,040
My brother-in-law doesn't look
like he knows how to farm either.

523
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

524
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,319
What about you?

525
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,719
What do you want
to do after this battle?

526
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,800
I...

527
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,280
I want to go back to my hometown

528
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,680
and open a medical center.

529
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,719
Although there is no war,

530
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,640
there must still be sick people.

531
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,599
So,

532
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,359
I can save people.

533
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,280
Why?

534
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,719
You don't want to be a warrior anymore?

535
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,400
No.

536
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,920
Being a good doctor

537
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:22,880
is also being a warrior.

538
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,160
Anyone who can save a life

539
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,199
is a warrior.

540
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,199
You have grown up a lot.

541
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,680
It is reasonable to assume

542
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,640
that Dong Shufang's troops

543
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,959
are no match for Fengyun Cavalry.

544
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,319
Fengxi should have entered
the Imperial City by now.

545
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,599
But there is no news at all.

546
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,400
Your Lordship.

547
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,119
Lin Ji, come.

548
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,719
What happened?

549
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,400
We encountered a very strong enemy
on Mount Luoying

550
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,680
and almost lost half of the 30,000 men
of Fengyun Cavalry.

551
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,560
Her Ladyship protected us
from the siege with all her might.

552
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,280
Please save my Queen quickly!

553
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,239
What strong enemy?

554
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,719
How is Fengxi?

555
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,000
We met Dong Shufang's troops

556
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,400
at Mount Luoying.

557
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,920
They are not the Imperial Army

558
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,359
but a group of powerful
and vicious soldiers

559
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,880
who are harmful to the people.

560
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,560
Her Ladyship asked me
to pass on a message

561
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,959
about the plans of Dadong Empire.

562
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,760
Her Ladyship is now fighting
for her life with her soldiers,

563
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,160
defending at Mount Luoying
where the situation is unknown.

564
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,119
Please send help at once!

565
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:47,959
Queen of Qingzhou is in danger

566
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,479
as the enemy rages on.

567
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:52,280
I am only competing
with Huang Chao for power.

568
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,319
Protecting people is more important.

569
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,439
Chuanyu, Xu Yuan.

570
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,439
Yes, Your Lordship.

571
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,199
I want 100,000 soldiers
to follow me to Mount Luoying.

572
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,959
Yes.

573
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:03,920
Come.

574
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,479
Zhong Li, go to Jizhou Encampment
on behalf of His Lordship

575
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
to deal with Huang Chao.

576
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,359
I will immediately gather the troops

577
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,839
and get out of the way to Dongdan

578
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
to show our sincerity.

579
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,959
Yes.

580
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,040
Your Lordship,

581
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,239
the envoy of Yongzhou
requests an audience with you.

582
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,760
What is the intention of Yongzhou

583
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,319
to send an envoy at this time?

584
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,199
Let him in.

585
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,160
Yes.

586
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
Inviting the envoy of Yongzhou
to an audience.

587
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,719
Greetings, Lord of Jizhou.

588
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,920
Why did Lord of Yongzhou
suddenly send you here?

589
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,319
My lord asked me to pass on
a message to Your Lordship.

590
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,000
Now that the army
of Dadong Empire is rampant,

591
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,079
my lord wants to retreat
for the time being

592
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,560
and eliminate the enemy first.

593
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,880
It is now a critical moment
in the battle between us.

594
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,680
Lord of Yongzhou retreats at this time,

595
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,280
why should I listen to his orders?

596
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,719
How can I know

597
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,439
that this is not
a trick of Lord of Yongzhou?

598
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:11,239
My lord said

599
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,680
that both of you are only competing
with each other for power.

600
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,599
My lord believes that Lord of Jizhou
thinks the same as he does.

601
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,319
When we fight with the enemy,

602
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,439
it will only cost the lives of people.

603
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,520
We hope Your Lordship will be able
to make the right decision.

604
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,800
Why should I trust you?

605
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,680
My lord

606
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,520
knows that you won't believe us.

607
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,719
That's why we've gotten out of the way

608
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,319
to Dongdan

609
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,839
so that Your Lordship can
head to the Imperial City first.

610
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,359
My lord also said

611
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,599
that Dadong Empire may have other plans.

612
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,719
So, Yongzhou Army

613
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,160
will travel with Your Lordship

614
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,839
at a distance of 30 li.

615
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,359
If there is anything you need,

616
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,640
we are here to help.

617
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,599
Your Lordship,

618
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,400
please

619
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,520
prioritize the people first.

620
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,640
Your Lordship,
Yongzhou Army has retreated.

621
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,560
Your Lordship,

622
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,680
my lord has kept his promise.

623
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,400
You go back first.

624
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,479
Yes.

625
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,560
Xuekong.

626
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:18,719
What do you think?

627
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,199
Your Lordship,

628
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,479
now that Yongzhou has retreated

629
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,680
to get out of the way
to the Imperial City,

630
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,000
perhaps this is true.

631
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,119
I am more worried

632
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,719
that the person behind this army

633
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,400
is not simple to deal with.

634
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:37,880
Fine.

635
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,040
This is indeed a good opportunity.

636
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,800
Let's give it a try.

637
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Assemble the troops

638
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,640
for the Imperial City immediately!

639
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,880
Yes.

640
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,662
(Capital of Jizhou, Wuhui Valley,
Capital of Yongzhou)

641
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,800
Sir,

642
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,839
Feng Lanxi has led
his troops to Mount Luoying.

643
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:09,839
But before he left,

644
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,119
he got out of the way to Dongdan.

645
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,479
The 300,000 soldiers of Jizhou Alliance

646
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,079
are now heading for the Imperial City.

647
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,680
They are expected
to arrive at the Imperial City

648
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,800
in less than ten days.

649
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,199
The Yongzhou Alliance
seems to be following behind.

650
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,680
There are now less than
10,000 soldiers in the city.

651
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,959
How should we defend it?

652
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,239
I still have 100,000 people in the city.

653
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,839
This is my way
of restraining Huang Chao.

654
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:33,040
Grown men continue
to train as divine soldiers.

655
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,160
And I have other uses

656
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
for the old and infirm.

657
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,400
The game is coming to a close.

658
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,719
If I succeed in killing
Feng Lanxi and Feng Xiyun,

659
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,839
the world

660
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,479
will be mine.

661
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,319
You're here, Wuyuan.

662
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,640
Come and take a look
at this painting of mine.

663
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,239
Your Majesty can't imitate

664
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,479
the state of mind of Mr. Xieyue.

665
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:15,959
Wuyuan,

666
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:18,400
Dong Shufang said you are unpredictable

667
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,959
and told me to watch out for you.

668
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,520
But I think you're good.

669
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,199
I don't like politics,

670
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,719
and you can help me.

671
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,439
I like to paint,

672
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,839
and you can appreciate it with me.

673
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,280
Anyway, Wuyuan,

674
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:32,520
what do you want?

675
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,520
I fear that if you want nothing,

676
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,920
I will not be able to keep you.

677
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,880
You've given me everything
I've ever wanted.

678
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,800
I, from the Empyrean Yu family,

679
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,920
want to see the world.

680
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,160
What is there to see in this world?

681
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,719
It's complicated
with loads of scrappy affairs.

682
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,439
Uninteresting at all.

683
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,839
Your Majesty finds it uninteresting
because you are not interested in it.

684
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,760
But I find it interesting.

685
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,319
Moreover, I almost own it.

686
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,920
Own it?

687
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,839
What do you mean?

688
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,880
You asked me to write an edict

689
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
saying that Huang Chao and Feng Lanxi
would be at war with each other,

690
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,640
and we would hide in the back
to clean up the mess.

691
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,880
In the end,

692
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,359
the world will still be mine.

693
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,479
You don't own this world.

694
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,520
It belongs to me.

695
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,479
When Queen of Qingzhou
dies on Mount Luoying,

696
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,199
Lord of Yongzhou dies in Liefeng Valley,

697
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,719
and Lord of Jizhou dies
in the Imperial City,

698
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:34,079
I will have won a great victory

699
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,280
and ascended to the throne.

700
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,760
I don't quite understand.

701
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,560
Haven't you been helping me?

702
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,760
The duty of the Empyrean Yu family

703
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,959
is to assist the Imperial Family
of Dadong Empire.

704
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,839
The duty of the Empyrean Yu family

705
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,800
is to assist those
who can pacify the world.

706
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,560
And I, Yu Wuyuan,

707
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,439
can make all the people in the world
submit to me right now.

708
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,119
Why should I give up my throne
to someone else?

709
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,920
Aren't you worried
about the Empyrean Token?

710
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:05,719
I already have the Empyrean Token.

711
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,239
Besides,

712
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,319
I have lifted the Blood Curse.

713
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,520
You killed my father.

714
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,040
If I hadn't killed him,

715
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,719
would it be your turn to be crowned?

716
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,880
So you are the 100-year lineage.

717
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:49,920
Martial Sister,

718
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,280
we have run out of food for our troops.

719
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,880
By all rights,

720
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,000
reinforcements should
have arrived by now.

721
00:32:59,119 --> 00:32:59,880
Be patient.

722
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,119
Tell the soldiers

723
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,479
to hold out one more day.

724
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,839
I'll share mine with everyone.

725
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,000
But, Martial Sister...

726
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,319
It's okay to eat one less meal.

727
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,280
Go.

728
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,359
Martial Sister,

729
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,920
this is what I have prepared
from the prescription.

730
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,800
This is the prescription.

731
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:18,199
This is the medicine.

732
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,079
Just apply it to your weapon

733
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:21,959
and hit your enemy,

734
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,479
so that they will be left limp

735
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,479
and crushed.

736
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:27,959
Pu,

737
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,040
this is a great relief.

738
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,400
But the quantity is still too little,

739
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,319
and the medicine only
works for ten hours.

740
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,079
It won't solve the war at all.

741
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,000
With this, there is hope.

742
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,000
We will get rid of all the enemy forces.

743
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,239
All right.

744
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,439
I remember there were 20 bonfires
by the side barracks.

745
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,199
Why are half of them missing today?

746
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,800
Half of them are missing?

747
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,439
Could it be that Dong Shufang
set up the fog on purpose

748
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,920
to make us think
that there are fewer soldiers

749
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,040
to tempt us to break out?

750
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,359
Hiding half of the army?

751
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,239
He can't do it.

752
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,760
What is the reason then?

753
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:10,639
I got it.

754
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,560
We are actually the bait.

755
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,280
Their purpose is
to lure Lord of Yongzhou out.

756
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,679
Dong Shufang knew
that reinforcements would come

757
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,560
so he sent his men to intercept
the reinforcements at night.

758
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,679
To lure Lord of Yongzhou out?

759
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,760
Yu Wuyuan knows Lanxi and me well.

760
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,679
He knows Lanxi will
definitely come to my rescue

761
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,919
if I am in danger.

762
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,919
So, he wants to take this opportunity

763
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,399
to wipe them all out.

764
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,000
Lord of Yongzhou may be in danger.

765
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,560
Han Pu,

766
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,120
immediately order the army to assemble

767
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,159
and break free in the night.

768
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,399
Yes.

769
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,239
Kill the enemy with me.

770
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,439
Kill!

771
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:55,000
Kill!

772
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,639
Your Lordship,

773
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,879
why did you suddenly halt the army?

774
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:51,719
There is an ambush.

775
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,239
There must be some sort of trick
to this silence.

776
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,399
Settle this as soon as possible!

777
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,479
Yes.

778
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,840
Kill!

779
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,439
Shoot the arrows.

780
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:44,959
Yes.

781
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,280
Pu.

782
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,479
Step aside.

783
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,399
I didn't ask you to use your bodies
to block arrows!

784
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,000
Martial Sister,

785
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:16,639
it looks like Dong Shufang

786
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,919
is going to trap us here completely.

787
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,719
Follow me down the mountain!

788
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:22,239
Fengyun Cavalry know

789
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,159
that they have lost this battle

790
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:29,320
and yet they are still protecting
their queen with their lives.

791
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:32,399
They are truly loyal.

792
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,399
This is worthy of respect.

793
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:49,879
Kill!

794
00:37:50,239 --> 00:38:00,479
Kill!

795
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,399
