20
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,959
After I pass away,

21
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,319
the throne will be yours.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You will be the second female ruler

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,760
within the Dadong Empire.

24
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,519
Rest assured, Father.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,680
I will take good care of Qingzhou.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,080
Your wits and martial arts skills
are unparalleled.

27
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,559
I can leave Qingzhou in your hands

28
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,199
without qualms.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,039
But...

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,479
Actually,

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,199
I would rather you find happiness.

32
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,360
I wanted to hold the weight
of the sky for you

33
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,399
so that you could be free of worries.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,919
But now...

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,158
You'll have to hold up the sky yourself.

36
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,080
I understand.

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,399
In today's world,

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,880
the Imperial Family is in decline,

39
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,720
and talents arise from the other states.

40
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,520
It is a time when talents meet.

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,720
I fear the balance
of the Six States will collapse.

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,119
If you possess

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,160
the ambitions,

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
go forth

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,479
and surpass our ancestors.

46
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,880
Become a female ruler

47
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,679
the world has never seen before.

48
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,559
I have remembered

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,399
your every word, Father.

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,360
I will not let our people suffer.

51
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,839
In my life,

52
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,720
I have failed your mother

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,800
and my children.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,559
I had little time
to spend with all of you.

55
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,559
Do you blame me?

56
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,600
Mother and we

57
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,360
have always
regarded you as our pride, Father.

58
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:07,167
(Langcheng)

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,160
Huang Chao.

60
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,160
Mr. Yu.

61
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,000
I have to thank both of you

62
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,480
for Youzhou's victory this time.

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,640
We have seized a city.

64
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,399
For our next step, I intend to take down

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,959
the entire Qingzhou in one fell swoop.

66
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,760
Your Lordship is wise and gifted.

67
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,519
Prince Huang and I
merely provided additional support.

68
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,799
However, I believe this is not the time

69
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,720
for us to make sudden moves.

70
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,839
Qingzhou has just lost Langcheng.

71
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,600
They must be recuperating
and gathering their strength

72
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,679
to prepare to launch their counterattack
at the best time.

73
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,519
Your Lordship.

74
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,440
We shouldn't confront them at this time.

75
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,239
Father-in-law,

76
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,600
I think Wuyuan is right.

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,320
Qingzhou is furious and grieving,

78
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,160
making its momentum at its peak.

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,399
We should consider the matter at length.

80
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,679
Very well.

81
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,760
I shall wait for the arrival
of the Skyrider Cavalry in the meantime.

82
00:05:59,359 --> 00:05:59,920
Huang Chao,

83
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,000
they should be here soon, right?

84
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,040
Father-in-law,

85
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,079
the Skyrider Cavalry
is our special covert army.

86
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,559
We know this

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,880
and do does Qingzhou.

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,000
That is why

89
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,119
the Skyrider Cavalry

90
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,559
will naturally show up
at the most suitable time.

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,040
Good.

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,079
I shall

93
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,359
look forward to it.

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,425
(Qingzhou)

95
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,440
All of the guards outside

96
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,679
are on edge.

97
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:21,880
They are afraid that you will slip

98
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,119
and fall from above.

99
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,920
You've been standing here all day.

100
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,279
Have something to eat and drink.

101
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,839
I'm still here.

102
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,480
Talk to me.

103
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,320
I can see all of Qingzhou from here.

104
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,720
This is the place my father and brother

105
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,160
spent their lives protecting.

106
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,679
Further away

107
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,519
lies the place
where my brother died in battle.

108
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,880
I have no family left.

109
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,000
No.

110
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,119
You still have me.

111
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
From now on,

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,280
I will fight and protect my people

113
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,479
just as my brother and father did.

114
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,960
I will be with you

115
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,880
no matter what.

116
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:57,320
Long live the Queen.

117
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,559
Rise.

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,479
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

119
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,520
My father and brother
have just passed away.

120
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,960
I've had to shoulder this responsibility
in a moment of crisis.

121
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,520
I am willing to work with all of you

122
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,919
to reclaim Qingzhou's city

123
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,719
and protect my people.

124
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,119
Dear ministers and officials,

125
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,400
do you have any wise plans
to defeat our enemies?

126
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
I believe

127
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,039
the Lord of Youzhou
disregarded the agreement

128
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
of the Six States

129
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,479
the moment they attacked Qingzhou.

130
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
I am willing to lead the Fengyun Cavalry

131
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,640
to banish the invaders

132
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,893
and offer their blood and flesh

133
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,239
(General of Fengyun Cavalry, Lin Ji)
to the late lord and Prince Xieyue.

134
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,880
Banish the invaders!

135
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,599
The backbone of Qingzhou

136
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
is bold and valorous indeed.

137
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,880
Cheng Zhi.

138
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,599
(General of Fengyun Cavalry, Cheng Zhi)
Yes, Your Ladyship.

139
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,239
The Golden Armor Cavalry
has invaded our state.

140
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,599
I will engage them in battle myself.

141
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,320
I leave you

142
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
in charge of guarding the capital

143
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,320
while I am away.

144
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
Understood.

145
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
Qi Shu. Lin Ji.

146
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,599
- Present.
- Present.

147
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,119
Tally the remaining numbers
of the Fengyun Cavalry.

148
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,080
Follow me to Licheng
to defeat our enemies.

149
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,599
- Yes, Your Ladyship.
- Yes, Your Ladyship.

150
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,440
During my absence,

151
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,119
I hope all of you

152
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,320
will do your best
in your respective duties.

153
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,520
Do not let me down.

154
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,599
We will not disappoint Your Ladyship.

155
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,400
Qingzhou has raised the Baifeng flag.

156
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,440
It seems Princess Xiyun is going

157
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,320
to follow in her ancestors' footsteps.

158
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,200
I didn't think she would be the first

159
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,719
to become the ruler in our generation.

160
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,280
Well, we'll see

161
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,320
if this phoenix can be reborn

162
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,599
from the ashes.

163
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,520
Hei Fengxi is Feng Lanxi.

164
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,719
Bai Fengxi is Feng Xiyun.

165
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,119
Interesting.

166
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,320
I had my doubts,

167
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,840
but I could never be certain.

168
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,400
Wherever Bai Fengxi is,
Hei Fengxi is never far.

169
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,119
It will be a tough war

170
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,880
to win.

171
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,760
If I were the Lord of Youzhou,
I would know the best move to make

172
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
would be to retreat.

173
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,280
However, given his headstrong
and self-willed character,

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
that option was never in his books.

175
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,440
Then again,

176
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,440
wouldn't it be easier for you

177
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,719
to control Youzhou if he suffers defeat?

178
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
That may be so,

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,280
but it would still be too cruel.

180
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,919
That doesn't sound like

181
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,520
the Prince Huang Chao of Jizhou that I know
that intends to rule the world.

182
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,799
If you don't advance on the battlefield,

183
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,919
you fall back.

184
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,919
So be it.

185
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,479
I'll just be engaging Hei-Bai Fengxi
earlier than expected.

186
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,239
The arrows are on the bowstring.

187
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,919
That is the only option.

188
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:02,086
(Qingzhou Encampment)

189
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,320
I

190
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,080
am guilty.

191
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,599
I followed His Highness to war,

192
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,599
but I was unable to protect him.

193
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,520
Please punish me, Your Ladyship.

194
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,359
Please get up.

195
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,239
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

196
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,919
You did well
by escorting the people to safety.

197
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,440
You did nothing wrong.

198
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,520
You are well-experienced

199
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:37,960
and familiar with the battlefield.

200
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,880
I will rely on you
for many things moving forward.

201
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,960
All of Qingzhou
mourns my brother's death.

202
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,840
We share

203
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,039
the same pain.

204
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,719
Rather than dwell in our sorrow,

205
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,159
it is better to turn it into strength

206
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,719
and reclaim what we lost
and protect our people.

207
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,359
I

208
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,280
will not fail this mission.

209
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
This is the heir
of Lord of Yongzhou, Feng Lanxi.

210
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,599
He has come to assist me

211
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,559
in defeating Jizhou and Youzhou.

212
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Tell me the current situation
of the war.

213
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,239
According to reports from the scouts,

214
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,239
the Golden Armor Cavalry's Lead Infantry
will arrive at dusk tomorrow

215
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,239
or early the morning after.

216
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
In that case,

217
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,320
we must prepare a hefty "gift" for them.

218
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,159
Your Ladyship,

219
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
do you have an idea in mind?

220
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,320
This place.

221
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
(Mount Yi)

222
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,280
Mount Yi.

223
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,520
Mount Yi.

224
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,280
A place they will have to pass through.

225
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,640
Do you intend
to ambush them here, Your Ladyship?

226
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,280
This mountain is neither high nor steep.

227
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,200
There isn't much forestry on it either.

228
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,320
It'll be difficult to hide.

229
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:50,159
How will our troops hide their presence?

230
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,960
The road at the foot of the mountain
is three zhang wide.

231
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,719
We can take this path.

232
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,400
There are several places
to lurk on the slopes of Mount Yi.

233
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,239
I have traveled around over the years.

234
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,640
I have some knowledge

235
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,200
of the number of mountains we have

236
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,679
and their respective topographies.

237
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,080
Our troops will hide and wait

238
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,520
for the Golden Armor Cavalry there.

239
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,799
We must let them know

240
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,159
that we are not to be trifled with.

241
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,520
- Yes, Your Ladyship.
- Yes, Your Ladyship.

242
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,400
Your Ladyship,

243
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,479
I would like
to present them with the "gift".

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,479
All right.

245
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,440
You will lead 500 men

246
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,440
and set up the ambush.

247
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,679
The moment their Lead Infantry arrives,

248
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,640
weaken their forces.

249
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:23,799
Do not draw out the battle.

250
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,679
Understood.

251
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,880
The Golden Armor Cavalry
is coming at us with full vigor.

252
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,679
In that case,
we'll take them down a peg or two.

253
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,159
Send my orders.

254
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,440
Have those on watch tonight

255
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,080
strengthen our defense

256
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,320
and watch out for the enemy.

257
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,520
Yes, Your Ladyship.

258
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,760
Have all the residents of Licheng
been evacuated?

259
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,960
As per your orders,

260
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:44,840
the people of Licheng

261
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
have all been evacuated
to Yangcheng and Qicheng.

262
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,119
Ensure we have sufficient rations
and supplies at Licheng.

263
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,159
Yes, Your Ladyship.

264
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,359
Everyone.

265
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
In this battle,

266
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,559
the underdogs will win.

267
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,799
Secure victory

268
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,960
to honor my deceased father and brother.

269
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,679
As Your Ladyship commands.

270
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,836
(Licheng, Qingzhou)

271
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,000
(Licheng, Qingzhou)
This will be a difficult battle.

272
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,520
You've worked hard.

273
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,359
It's a little early to say that.

274
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,479
I do have a question for you, however.

275
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,559
From an onlooker's point of view,

276
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,520
what do you think
of Qingzhou's Fengyun Cavalry?

277
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,799
Though you have 10,000 troops,
they do not make clamor.

278
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,599
The generals and commanders

279
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,479
are extremely capable
and obey all orders.

280
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,159
The Fengyun Cavalry

281
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,640
lives up to its name.

282
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,159
The Skyrider Cavalry of Jizhou
has 200,000 soldiers.

283
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,280
The Golden Armor Cavalry of Youzhou
has 150,000.

284
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,039
Yongzhou has a total
of 200,000 troops as well,

285
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,960
not including your Moyu Cavalry.

286
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:44,280
Despite this,

287
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,320
all of you want more troops.

288
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,000
I, on the other hand,

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
only wish to protect Qingzhou.

290
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,760
A Fengyun Cavalry
with 100,000 soldiers is enough.

291
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,640
You're acting more and more
like a ruler now.

292
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm worried I'll be losing soon.

293
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,319
I know you're trying to lift my spirits.

294
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,119
It's true
that I can only feel more at ease

295
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,839
when I am with you.

296
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,400
You are the carefree Heroine Bai Fengxi,

297
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,199
and you're the regal Queen Feng Xiyun too.

298
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,000
Both of them are your true selves.

299
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
You have to believe in yourself.

300
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,040
No one knows me

301
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,479
as you do.

302
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,079
I will not

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,079
disappoint you either.

304
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,680
Don't worry.

305
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,640
I will be by your side.

306
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
You have not only me

307
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,319
but also the Moyu Cavalry
and Fountain Abode

308
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
to support you.

309
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,199
I understand what you mean.

310
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,719
I will not let you use
your own forces to help me

311
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,839
unless absolutely necessary.

312
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,040
All right.

313
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
As you say.

314
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,479
But let's make this clear.

315
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,160
I will be by your side

316
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,400
on the battlefield.

317
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,280
You can't refuse me.

318
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,400
It's dangerous on the battlefield.

319
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,520
Things are unpredictable...

320
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,800
That is exactly all the more reason

321
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,640
I must be with you.

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,479
I made a promise
to the late Lord of Qingzhou,

323
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,479
Prince Xieyue,

324
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,760
and myself.

325
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,680
So

326
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,560
stop trying to change my mind.

327
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,479
All right.

328
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,839
I entrust my life

329
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,479
to you.

330
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,319
I will do everything

331
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,239
to keep you safe.

332
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,199
Retreat.

333
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,280
Your Ladyship is wise indeed.

334
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,640
We set up an ambush

335
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,040
and took down several thousands

336
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,280
of the Golden Armor Cavalry's
lead troops.

337
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,520
I'm sure

338
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,239
the Lord of Youzhou
will be "pleased" to hear that.

339
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,800
Youzhou's Lead Infantry
should arrive at dawn tomorrow.

340
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,119
According to my calculations,

341
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,119
they will attack the city immediately.

342
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,280
Their army will have just arrived.

343
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,560
Logically, they should rest
for a day or two

344
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,520
before launching their attack.

345
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,959
If they were to attack right away,

346
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
the front-line general...

347
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,680
The Lead Infantry lost 5,000 men
before even reaching Licheng.

348
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,439
I'm sure the general
will want to seize Licheng

349
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,760
before his lord arrives

350
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,160
to make up for his mistakes.

351
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,760
How are you going to deal with them?

352
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,239
With the Bloody Phoenix Formation

353
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,760
created by my ancestor.

354
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,599
Famous books on military strategies
have said the following.

355
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,439
Run when you encounter the Feng,

356
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,640
Feng Duying of the Feng family,

357
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,880
and the Bloody Phoenix Formation.

358
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,119
But,

359
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,520
Youzhou and Qingzhou
have been fighting for years.

360
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,119
They should know a way to deal with it.

361
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,839
I think...

362
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,760
You mean

363
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
we should make some changes

364
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,319
to the existing formation.

365
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,280
Prince Feng,

366
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,680
Qingzhou's
Bloody Phoenix Formation is renowned.

367
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,439
We've been fighting
against Youzhou for many years.

368
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,640
If they knew how to solve it,

369
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,400
they would've attacked us
a long time ago.

370
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,839
But we are not just going up

371
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,760
against Youzhou.

372
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,160
His concerns are justified.

373
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,920
Youzhou's generals
may not be able to break it,

374
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:57,280
but we must be on guard

375
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,400
against Huang Chao and Yu Wuyuan.

376
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,079
Bring the diagram of the formation.

377
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,239
Your Ladyship,

378
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,280
the Bloody Phoenix Formation
is Qingzhou's...

379
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,920
I, Feng Lanxi, hereby vow

380
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,439
that I will never reveal this
to another soul.

381
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,880
I trust him.

382
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,439
Bring the diagram.

383
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,239
Yes, Your Ladyship.

384
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:28,593
(Licheng)

385
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,719
Your ancestor created
the Bloody Phoenix Formation

386
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,520
and helped Emperor Weilie
to conquer the world.

387
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,479
She was the only female general
among the six lords.

388
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,599
Emperor Weilie was deeply moved

389
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,839
and wanted to name her his empress

390
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,640
and rule the world with her.

391
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,920
However, Feng Duying enjoyed freedom.

392
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:43,439
She turned him down.

393
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,199
He then decided
to give her a piece of territory.

394
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,599
Later, to make things fair,

395
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,400
he divided the land into six states.

396
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,839
That is the origin
of Dadong and the Six States.

397
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,280
Qingzhou upholds peace.

398
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,599
The rulers of Qingzhou
have never been fond of war.

399
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,719
The Bloody Phoenix Formation
was left untouched for many years.

400
00:21:59,239 --> 00:21:59,959
Until

401
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,920
today.

402
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,280
That is how Qingzhou has always been.

403
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,040
We will not attack

404
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,560
unless we are attacked.

405
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,280
My father died of illness,
and my brother was killed.

406
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,439
Qingzhou is in danger.

407
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,119
To protect my people,

408
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,599
I must resort to this.

409
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,520
Report!

410
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,479
Your Ladyship, the Golden Armor Cavalry
is 100 zhang away from the city gate.

411
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:23,800
Take up the gauntlet.

412
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:24,959
Yes, Your Ladyship.

413
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,114
(Licheng)

414
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:51,880
Sir!

415
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,319
They only sent out 10,000 soldiers!

416
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,359
Are they underestimating us

417
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,040
after the ambush?

418
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,239
Men!

419
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,800
We must capture Licheng

420
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,280
before His Lordship arrives!

421
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,199
Get them!

422
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:16,280
Charge!

423
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,920
How can this be?

424
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:27,839
Useless!

425
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,479
Every one of you!

426
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,680
30,000 men were wiped out in one day!

427
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,680
Ye Yan is inept!

428
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,640
Father-in-law,
please appease your anger.

429
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,479
The new ruler of Qingzhou, Feng Xiyun,
was the one defending the city.

430
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,560
She has a long-standing reputation.

431
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,439
General Ye must have lost

432
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,000
because he underestimated her.

433
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,959
As such,

434
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,599
that is even more reason
for us not to act recklessly.

435
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,040
Feng Xiyun

436
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
is but a little girl.

437
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
Mr. Yu,

438
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,400
you are well-read in military tactics.

439
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,719
Is there a way to break the formation?

440
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,880
Your Lordship,

441
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,599
this is the Bloody Phoenix Formation

442
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,119
created by the first ruler
of Qingzhou, Lord Feng.

443
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,000
The formation is said
to be unpredictable.

444
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,560
Those caught in the formation

445
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,359
are said to be as if hunted
by a bloodthirsty phoenix

446
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,439
and will find no rest
until they are devoured.

447
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:19,599
Lord Feng used this
to defeat Lord Tao back then.

448
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,160
Using one against ten,
and decimating the enemy troops.

449
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,599
I have yet to hear of anyone
successfully breaking this formation.

450
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,560
Is it truly that powerful?

451
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,119
I dare not deceive Your Lordship.

452
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Then,

453
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,239
doesn't that mean I have no choice

454
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,880
but to retreat?

455
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,719
Huang Chao,
where is your Skyrider Cavalry?

456
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,520
Father,

457
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,239
it is not impossible to secure victory.

458
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,520
However,

459
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,359
we must first observe it
before we are to destroy it.

460
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,920
So...

461
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Meng Hai.

462
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,319
Present.

463
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,599
Lead 5,000 soldiers
and attack the city at nine!

464
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Understood.

465
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:03,659
(Youzhou Encampment)

466
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,319
(Youzhou Encampment)
I remember you gave Ye Yan a sachet.

467
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,680
Did it not contain the way
to break the formation?

468
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,319
Or did you

469
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,079
plan this?

470
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,800
I did give him a sachet,

471
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,560
and it did contain the method
to break the formation.

472
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,560
However, changes were made
to the formation.

473
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,560
Is Feng Xiyun that capable?

474
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I don't think it was her doing.

475
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,439
Feng Lanxi?

476
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,719
If you wish to conquer the world,

477
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,880
those two will be formidable enemies.

478
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,560
I've never been afraid of powerful foes.

479
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,000
However,

480
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,079
if we are not
to launch an all-out attack now,

481
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,160
then what are we waiting for, Wuyuan?

482
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,079
For the Lord of Youzhou
to unleash his ultimate weapon.

483
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,959
The artilleries?

484
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,199
Yes.

485
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,719
They are the reason why you and I came

486
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:49,680
to Youzhou.

487
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,119
But those things

488
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,959
will cause devastating damage
and cost countless lives.

489
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,719
That gives us

490
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,119
more reason

491
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,400
to seize control of such a weapon.

492
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,079
The Lord of Youzhou wants to use
thousands of soldiers as bait

493
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
to lure out the Bloody Phoenix Formation

494
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,040
to find a way to break it.

495
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,079
He must be waiting for the right time

496
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:25,239
to send his 100,000 troops
to wipe out your cavalry.

497
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,800
But my cavalry

498
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:30,319
is well-prepared.

499
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,280
The Lord of Youzhou underestimated you.

500
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,160
Your Lordship,

501
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,000
the Fengyun Cavalry
did not set up the formation.

502
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,400
However, we have already lost 3,000 men.

503
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,599
Please order the troops to retreat!

504
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,479
If not...

505
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:08,703
(Youzhou Encampment)

506
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,479
I was incompetent.
I will accept punishment, Your Lordship.

507
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,280
General Meng Hai.

508
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,520
Go and get some rest, all of you.

509
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,520
Yes, Your Lordship.

510
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,319
Military Adviser.

511
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,439
Your Lordship.

512
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,040
Any news about the Skyrider Cavalry?

513
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,199
Not yet.

514
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,280
Does Huang Chao intend

515
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:35,560
to take advantage

516
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,640
of my battle with Qingzhou?

517
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:38,400
Your Lordship,

518
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,959
I believe he does have that in mind.

519
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,839
But that is merely because

520
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,880
he is unaware of Youzhou's

521
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,959
true force.

522
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,479
If our troops invade in large numbers,

523
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,439
they may be trapped
in the Bloody Phoenix Formation.

524
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,719
If we send fewer soldiers,
they might be defeated by the archers.

525
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:55,959
Enough.

526
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,040
How soon can the artilleries get here?

527
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,880
Your Lordship,

528
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,760
they will arrive
at one tomorrow afternoon.

529
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,479
Good.

530
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Seize Licheng at three
the day after tomorrow!

531
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:09,119
Yes, Your Lordship.

532
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,000
That little girl, Feng Xiyun.

533
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,599
I will see to it
that you are defeated this time!

534
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:20,000
(Licheng)

535
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,680
Your plan worked.

536
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,760
Yes.

537
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,359
I stopped the Lord of Youzhou in Licheng

538
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,280
to force him
to bring out his artilleries.

539
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,760
The artilleries are weapons
capable of causing mass destruction.

540
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,920
If we let that thing
enter the battlefield,

541
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,599
who knows how many lives will be lost?

542
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,400
So I must have him bring it out
and get rid of them

543
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
as soon as possible.

544
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,959
So

545
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,359
you had the main army retreat first.

546
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,199
Yes.

547
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,400
I heard those artilleries
are immensely powerful.

548
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,040
One shot can injure hundreds.

549
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:20,239
They can tear down
even the sturdiest city walls.

550
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,520
That's why

551
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,199
I want to see

552
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,199
just how much damage it can cause.

553
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,199
What about you?

554
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,199
I'll be by your side, of course.

555
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,719
Men!

556
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,239
Blow up the city gate!

557
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:47,959
Yes, Your Ladyship!

558
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:11,560
(Licheng)

559
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,000
Protect the artilleries!

560
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,298
Shame.

561
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,959
We only destroyed one
out of the five artilleries.

562
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,239
Huang Chao has made his appearance.

563
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,719
Those artilleries are as good

564
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,760
as tens of thousands of troops
in his hands.

565
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,680
I have another idea.

566
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,280
We'll advance by retreat.

567
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,239
Like you,

568
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,686
Feng Xiyun
is after Youzhou's artilleries,

569
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,553
except she wants to destroy them.

570
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Youzhou used ten years
to build five artilleries,

571
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,239
and she destroyed one in a day.

572
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,400
As expected of her.

573
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,400
One of the artilleries you've been
longing for all this time was destroyed.

574
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,040
Don't you feel upset?

575
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
I believe

576
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,560
this is an opportunity.

577
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,199
Once I examine the remains,

578
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,640
I'm sure I'll find a way
to produce them.

579
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,199
One artillery was destroyed,

580
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,359
but I gained the method

581
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,000
to create countless more.

582
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Isn't that a good thing?

583
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:47,719
The Wuyuan I know

584
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,040
strives for the well-being
of the people.

585
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,640
Artilleries are weapons
of mass destruction.

586
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:54,760
I've said that before.

587
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,640
Well, that depends

588
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,599
on who controls them.

589
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,997
(Licheng)

590
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,359
Your Lordship.

591
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,479
Speak.

592
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,079
The gates of Licheng are wide open.

593
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,640
There are no signs of living within.

594
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,760
On the towers

595
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,439
are only strawmen dressed in armor.

596
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,800
That little girl, Feng Xiyun,

597
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,199
must be afraid of my artilleries.

598
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,239
That's why they fled.

599
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,599
Send my command.

600
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,959
We will enter the city and recuperate.

601
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,359
Continue to pursue the Fengyun Cavalry.

602
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:02,839
As Your Lordship commands.

603
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,959
The Wuhui Valley
is the next stop after Licheng.

604
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,639
Feng Lanxi and Feng Xiyun

605
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,560
will surely

606
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,040
finish the battle
with the Golden Armor Cavalry there.

607
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,360
Indeed.

608
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,040
Xuekong notified me yesterday.

609
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:27,959
Is the Skyrider Cavalry here?

610
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,679
They will be here soon.

611
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,919
It is all thanks
to the late Lord of Youzhou

612
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,239
that Youzhou is the most prosperous
and wealthy of all the states today.

613
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,399
Unfortunately,

614
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,679
his successor

615
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,520
is such a headstrong, short-sighted,

616
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:42,159
and self-absorbed man.

617
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,520
What do you plan to do then?

618
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,600
I will replace him,

619
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,879
of course.

620
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,760
Feng Xiyun deliberately gave up Licheng.

621
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,879
She must be after the four artilleries.

622
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,760
That's the reason
she let the Lord of Youzhou

623
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,320
occupy Licheng, isn't it?

624
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,560
It would be too difficult
to infiltrate the Youzhou Encampment

625
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,040
and destroy the artilleries there.

626
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,560
She is familiar with Licheng.

627
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,040
There is only one place they can store

628
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,959
the artilleries.

629
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,679
To think there would be
such secret passages

630
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,679
within Licheng.

631
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,439
Keep going forward
after this secret alley.

632
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,520
This is the only place in this city

633
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,760
where they can set up the artilleries.

634
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,800
Queen of Qingzhou.
Heir of Lord of Yongzhou.

635
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,639
We meet again.

636
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,080
Prince Huang. Mr. Yu.

637
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,280
It has been a while.

638
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,639
What?

639
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,239
Do you plan to keep us here?

640
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,600
Are you sure you can do that?

641
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,000
I am aware of my capabilities.

642
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,000
Given both of your skills,

643
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,000
it would be a tie at best.

644
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,520
Think of this
as a meeting of old friends.

645
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,439
I would like to talk to both of you.

646
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,239
Are you planning to make peace?

647
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,800
Will you be representing Jizhou

648
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:00,800
or Youzhou?

649
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,520
I speak on behalf
of both Youzhou and Jizhou,

650
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,360
of course.

651
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,239
In my case,

652
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,800
there can only be one outcome.

653
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,399
Jizhou and Youzhou

654
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,080
will have to concede
to Yongzhou and Qingzhou.

655
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,360
Well, wise minds certainly think alike.

656
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
However, it would be the opposite

657
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,439
in my case.

658
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,280
I look forward to fighting you

659
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,639
on the battlefield, Prince Lanxi.

660
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,479
I as well.

661
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,600
Prince Huang.

662
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:32,760
I've never forgotten

663
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,280
the spy you planted.

664
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,560
When the time comes,

665
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,800
we'll have to settle that score.

666
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,159
In one way or another,

667
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,560
it gave you
your position today, didn't it?

668
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,280
There is no one

669
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,280
standing in your way in Yongzhou now.

670
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,679
I doubt you came
to catch up on old times, Prince Huang.

671
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,280
Did you come to stop us

672
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,239
from destroying the four artilleries?

673
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,800
If that is your intention,

674
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,800
I cannot stand idly by, of course.

675
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
You'll have to go through me

676
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,760
to get to the firearms camp.

677
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:01,800
You've seen the power

678
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,159
those things can cause
in the past two days.

679
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,600
Can we really allow

680
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,399
such a terrifying weapon to exist?

681
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,120
As the heir of the Empyrean Yu family,

682
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,959
can you allow that as well, Mr. Yu?

683
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,120
Weapons of all kinds

684
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,000
are devastating

685
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,360
to the common folk.

686
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,600
What is the point of destroying them

687
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,199
if wars are not ceased?

688
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:24,040
It looks like Prince Huang
intends to use force

689
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,919
to end this war.

690
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,120
I only fight on the battlefield.

691
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,959
No innocent civilians will be harmed.

692
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,719
Don't get ahead of yourself.

693
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,000
It would be better
to destroy such a weapon at once

694
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,479
than to let it exist.

695
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,719
Since both of you insist,

696
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,919
make your move then.

697
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,560
I must destroy the artilleries.

698
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,280
Excuse me.

699
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,399
To the firearms camp.

700
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,159
Hurry!

701
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,639
My artilleries!

702
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,080
This way!

703
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,040
Hurry!

704
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,439
Quickly!

705
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
My artilleries!

706
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,919
Who did this?

707
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,800
Who? Who did this?

708
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,280
Who?

709
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,879
Your Lordship.

710
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,040
It was someone from Qingzhou.

711
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:18,080
All the artilleries have been destroyed.

712
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,959
Feng Xiyun.

713
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,760
I will seize her!

714
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,320
I will not give up!

715
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,919
Hurry up and put out the fire!

716
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:26,600
Yes, Your Lordship.

717
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,479
Hurry! Over here!

718
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:29,760
Feng Xiyun!

719
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,439
Feng Xiyun!

720
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,199
You will pay for this!

721
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,360
Are you not going to make your move yet?

722
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,199
It's not the time yet.

723
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,479
Her strategy to control her enemy
by first disrupting his mind

724
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,959
proved effective.

725
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,760
Since the incident with Licheng,

726
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,159
her successive moves have confused
and unsettled the Lord of Youzhou.

727
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,399
If I were to strike,

728
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,199
I would at least ensure
that I knew my opponents' moves first.

729
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,280
Otherwise, I might not be successful

730
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,120
in depleting both forces' powers.

731
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,120
The Valley of No Return
is next after Licheng.

732
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,520
I wonder

733
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,479
who won't make it out alive this time?

734
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,040
Well, it won't be either of us for sure.

735
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,719
Hurry!

736
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,959
- Martial Sister.
- Martial Sister!

737
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:15,760
Langhua.

738
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,840
Why are you guys here?

739
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
Where are the others
from Tianshuang Sect?

740
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:20,719
They stayed behind at the sect.

741
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:21,800
The three of us came here

742
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,159
because we discovered new leads.

743
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,080
After returning to the Tianshuang Sect,

744
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,639
I sorted through my father's belongings.

745
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,239
I discovered

746
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,679
a fragmented jade pendant was missing.

747
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,080
What jade pendant?

748
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:33,959
I don't think that belonged to him.

749
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,000
I remember my father would sometimes
stare at the jade pendant in concern

750
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
after he returned
from the capital of Yongzhou.

751
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,919
The jade pendant had a distinct feature,

752
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:41,919
so I remembered.

753
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,360
When he was at the dungeon in Yongzhou,

754
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,239
he asked a jade carver

755
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,520
about the pendant.

756
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,520
The jade carver told him

757
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,919
the pendant belonged
to the Empyrean Yu family.

758
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,280
So you suspect

759
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,239
Yu Wuyuan took it?

760
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,280
Yes.

761
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,239
Who else could it be
from the Empyrean Yu family?

762
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,760
I recalled what happened that day

763
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,439
and remembered he was there as well.

764
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,800
He must have had ulterior motives.

765
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,639
If the jade pendant is a key connection

766
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,800
to what my father was investigating,

767
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,479
then the person who took the pendant

768
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,120
is most likely my father's murderer.

769
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,639
Did you guys find anything

770
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,600
when you followed him here then?

771
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,600
We followed Yu Wuyuan all this way

772
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,639
and learned that he was traveling
with Huang Chao of Jizhou.

773
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,159
When we entered the city,

774
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,679
we ran into General Qi,
who was surrounded by Youzhou's troops

775
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,840
as he tried to blow up the artilleries.

776
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,239
We couldn't watch and do nothing

777
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,439
when we found out
it was Qingzhou's army.

778
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,199
So we worked together with General Qi

779
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,959
and set off all the explosives
in the firearms camp.

780
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:31,479
Han Pu helped

781
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,280
to set the barracks on fire too.

782
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,840
He distracted them

783
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,239
and allowed us to escape.

784
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,679
You did a fantastic job, Pu.

785
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,120
You're amazing.

786
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,040
Won't you make me a general then,
Martial Sister?

787
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,120
I heard from Miss Langhua

788
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,840
that you are the Queen of Qingzhou now.

789
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,760
I wanted to see what you were like
as the ruler of Qingzhou,

790
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,959
so I came along.

791
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:55,239
I saw you earlier. You looked so mighty.

792
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,679
General Qi looked

793
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,560
so powerful too.

794
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,320
All right. I promise you.

795
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,800
I will make you a general,

796
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,479
- all right?
- Really?

797
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:07,199
If Yu Wuyuan is indeed the culprit,

798
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,439
given his wary nature,

799
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
he will pull every string
to get himself out of it.

800
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,320
We thought of that too.

801
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,520
So

802
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,000
we don't have enough proof yet.

803
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,760
We heard there were other Token Keepers
at the borders.

804
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,439
We want to go there to learn more

805
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,760
and gather more evidence.

806
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,439
