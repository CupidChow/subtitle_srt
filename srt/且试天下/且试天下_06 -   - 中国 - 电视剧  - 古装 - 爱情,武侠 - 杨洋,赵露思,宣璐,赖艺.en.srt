=Episode 6=

20
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,480
Father ordered me
to participate in the hunt.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,279
I had no choice but to obey.

22
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,800
I've been ill for a long time.

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,720
Somehow, that has turned me
into somewhat of a physician.

24
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,720
While I was studying medicine,

25
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,760
I discovered
that the sap of Lanwei flowers

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,440
could temporarily tame wild animals.

27
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,239
That's why I had
Chuanyun and the others use this method

28
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,519
to lure the prey.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,919
What about your wishes?

30
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,639
My wishes

31
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:05,959
are similar to Minister Feng's.

32
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,240
I am willing to hunt for you,

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,039
Father.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,320
Minister Feng.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,240
Looks like the Cloud Cutter Sword
will remain with my family.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,759
Xi.

37
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,559
Receive the sword.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,559
Thank you, Father.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,939
(Feng Qiwu's Residence, Yongzhou)

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,679
Chief, you wanted to see me?

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,039
Elder.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,279
Go and bring me

43
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,080
the box I hid at the Fountain Abode.

44
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,919
Help me buy
a piece of information from them.

45
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,639
What information?

46
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,679
Information

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
regarding the Second Prince, Feng Lanxi.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
Prince Lanxi did gain favor today,

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,240
but it was through cheap tricks.

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
Do we have to get

51
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,240
the Fountain Abode involved?

52
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,360
Elder.

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,720
What do you think
of my assessment of people?

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,320
Precise but ruthless.

55
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,360
You have a much sharper eye than me.

56
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,919
What if a person

57
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:27,880
managed to dupe everyone
for a dozen years,

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,360
and even got me deceived?

59
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,039
What do you think

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,919
of the person's shrewdness

61
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,479
and scheming?

62
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,160
Go on.

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,039
Yes, Chief.

64
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,679
Miss Huan.

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,240
What is it?

66
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,320
Miss Huan.

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
You've been serving His Highness
for a dozen years.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,720
Within the residence,

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,679
you must be the one
who knows His Highness best.

70
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,800
So I'd like to ask you something.

71
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,039
Is it about
why His Highness pretended to be weak?

72
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,800
Yes.

73
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,639
Why don't you ask your father?

74
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,720
My father wouldn't tell me.

75
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,679
Miss Huan, tell me, please.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,440
I'll have to start from the beginning.

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,119
(His Highness' birth mother)

78
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,359
(was Princess Yige of Dadong.)

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,880
(Princess is the sister)

80
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,600
(of Emperor Chunxi.)

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,519
(Queen of Yongzhou, Yige)
(Her status is unrivaled.)

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
(So naturally,
she would become Yong's first queen.)

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,399
The late queen
was virtuous and unblemished.

84
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,839
Despite knowing the lord took

85
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,239
Baili as a concubine
before their wedding,

86
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,160
(she still welcomed her
into the palace.)

87
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,200
(She also took in her son)

88
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,160
(Young Baili)
(as her own.)

89
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,279
(It was none other than First Prince,
Feng Chang.)

90
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,760
(Because of that,)

91
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,320
(despite Prince Chang's aloofness
towards others,)

92
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,920
(Young Feng Chang)
(he's always adored His Highness.)

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,279
(he's always adored His Highness.)

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,119
(The late queen's health deteriorated
after giving birth.)

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,959
(Baili attended
to His Lordship with full devotion.)

96
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,119
(After giving birth
to the Third Prince, Feng Ju,)

97
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,160
(she was conferred
the title of consort.)

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,239
(Due to her identity,)

99
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,279
(the queen
did not contend for attention.)

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,559
(Young Feng Lanxi)
(She feared the accusation of jealousy.)

101
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,600
(Several years later,)

102
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,559
(she died from heartache.)

103
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:05,920
(Before long,)

104
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,720
(Baili was conferred as the new queen.)

105
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,399
(She is the current queen)

106
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,720
(who went to pray
at Mount Ning ten days ago.)

107
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,640
(Teenage Feng Lanxi)
(Everyone thinks of Baili)

108
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,600
(Teenage Feng Lanxi)
(as kind and virtuous.)

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,600
(She regards His Highness
as her own son.)

110
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,320
(But little do they know.)

111
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,679
Baili is only trying
to spoil His Highness.

112
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,320
She purposely
sent courtesans and beautiful women

113
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,480
to attend to His Highness,

114
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,079
all because

115
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,359
she wants her own son, Prince Ju,

116
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,399
to be first in line
for the title of the heir of lord.

117
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,959
After the late lord passed away,

118
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,559
His Lordship did not appoint
the heir right away.

119
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
And he never paid much attention
to His Highness.

120
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,119
I feel bad

121
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,200
that he has to cosy up
to Baili on one hand,

122
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,239
while working hard on the other.

123
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,119
He's been persevering for three years

124
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:49,359
before the chance came

125
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,000
to drive Baili out with the reason

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
of being poisoned.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
His Highness had a birth mother
who was unlucky.

128
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,519
Then he had a deceptive stepmother.

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,799
Not to forget
the traitorous palace maids.

130
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,000
I see.

131
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,279
This is why His Highness
has been pretending to be weak.

132
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,440
If His Highness
hadn't been sick for so long,

133
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,160
Baili would never have stopped.

134
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,359
Fortunately, in these past years,

135
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,000
she believes His Lordship only favors
her birth son, Prince Ju.

136
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,679
So she hasn't been finding fault
with His Highness.

137
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,359
If she hadn't lowered her guard,

138
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,880
His Highness wouldn't have been able

139
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,200
to manage the Fountain Abode smoothly.

140
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,079
I counted.

141
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,119
I think our prince fell ill

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,119
in the 14th year of Chunxi's reign.

143
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,679
Miss Huan, doesn't that mean

144
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,320
His Highness only used eight years

145
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,160
to concurrently master literature
and arts

146
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,600
while building up the Fountain Abode
to be the world's best?

147
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,839
His Highness is a genius.

148
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,440
If not,

149
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,679
how did you think

150
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,279
His Highness was able
to be elegant yet secretive

151
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,320
while playing
two of the Four Gentry roles

152
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,679
at the same time?

153
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,279
Then why did His Highness

154
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,040
make himself conspicuous
at the autumn hunt?

155
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm sure His Highness has a plan.

156
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,320
We just have to oblige.

157
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,839
I told you all this today

158
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,279
not only to curb your curiosity

159
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,119
and make you serve him whole-heartedly,

160
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720
but also

161
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,920
to let you know

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,040
that His Highness has started to move.

163
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,559
You must be prepared

164
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,640
to do your part for His Highness.

165
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,440
Your Highness.

166
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,320
I asked you to be the messenger.

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,079
Have you passed the message
to Bai Fengxi?

168
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I wasn't able to.

169
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,079
Miss Feng has left Peicheng.

170
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,079
But the intel from various sources

171
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
says that Tianshuang Sect
is heading for King Ma's castle.

172
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,040
So she has the same idea as me.

173
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,959
There's a message about Feng Family.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,160
Chief Feng

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
seems to have taken an interest in me.

176
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,760
Your Highness.

177
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,160
How should we reply?

178
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,359
Tomorrow at noon.

179
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,079
Lanyun Pavilion.

180
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
I will wait for her there.

181
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,160
Yes, sir.

182
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,079
Looks like

183
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,079
we managed
to get ahead of Soultaker Sect.

184
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
According to what we found out about the Ties,

185
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,600
the Soultaker Sect will surely
be watching the Ma family.

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,000
They will be notified

187
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,279
at the slightest movement.

188
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,920
The way it is,

189
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
we can only prepare ourselves

190
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,279
and invite the guest in.

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,119
We do not know how many men

192
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,119
the Soultaker Sect has sent.

193
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,479
With the few of us,

194
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,719
we will be outnumbered.

195
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,599
Since it's a set-up,

196
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,599
we'll need Mas' cooperation.

197
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,200
That's the only way

198
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,200
to stop the Soultaker Sect's scheme.

199
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,280
Master.

200
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:45,599
I have an idea.

201
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,719
It may or may not work.

202
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,840
Speak up.

203
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,040
(Ma Family, Jizhou)

204
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,559
I am Bai Fengxi of Tianshuang Sect.

205
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,239
I have an important matter
to discuss with you.

206
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:02,599
Bai Fengxi?

207
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,531
(Chief of Ma Family, Ma Mengqi)

208
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,119
Why did you suddenly turn up
at King Ma's castle?

209
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,119
And why did you come to see me

210
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,280
in this manner?

211
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,479
It's an emergency.

212
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,000
I hope you understand.

213
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,679
Have you heard that lately,

214
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,440
many sects and clans

215
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,599
have fallen prey to the Soultaker Sect?

216
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,239
Yes, I have.

217
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,159
Word out there is that

218
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,440
the Soultaker Sect is ruthless.

219
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,679
Wherever they pass through,

220
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,719
they leave behind carnage and despair.

221
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,599
I see.

222
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,239
Rest assured, Heroine Feng.

223
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,799
King Ma's castle
is an advocate for justice.

224
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,840
We won't sit by idly.

225
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,000
If needed,

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,159
the Mas will take action.

227
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,359
Master Ma is upright and noble.

228
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,280
You have my respect.

229
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,840
But I didn't come today

230
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,559
to ask for help.

231
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:52,919
Not to ask for help?

232
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,960
Then why are you here?

233
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,359
We think

234
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,919
the Soultaker Sect's next target

235
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,320
is the Ma family.

236
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,280
What makes you think the Soultaker Sect

237
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,200
would want to harm us Mas?

238
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,799
The Soultaker Sect is brutal.

239
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,960
Everything is done for profit.

240
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,559
In the eliminated sects,

241
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,359
many of them perished for good.

242
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,520
But the Soultaker Sect
was only putting up a show.

243
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,559
Their real targets

244
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,320
are the Hans, Ties, Xuanyuan Sect,

245
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,400
and you, the Ma family.

246
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,599
Their motive is to gather

247
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,440
the four main assets of soldiers,
medicine, arrays, and horses

248
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,080
and secretly set up an army

249
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,559
to take over the world.

250
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
I had thought

251
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,520
it was a simple power scuffle.

252
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,039
I didn't expect it

253
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,080
to involve the whole world.

254
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:41,960
What is your thought,

255
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,200
Heroine Feng?

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,640
My master has set up
the necessary defense outside.

257
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,320
I hope you'll agree

258
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,479
to work with us.

259
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,000
So you want us to be the bait?

260
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,799
Yes.

261
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,440
All right.

262
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,719
It's fine to be the bait.

263
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,280
As long as we can eradicate
the Soultaker Sect,

264
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,760
we, the Mas will do everything
we can to help.

265
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,159
Besides,

266
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,880
if the Soultaker Sect falls on my turf,

267
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,840
I will have reason to brag.

268
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,559
Thank you, Chief Ma.

269
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,200
Master, after two days of observation,

270
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,640
we've determined
the layout of King Ma's castle.

271
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,840
Any movements?

272
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:25,960
Everything is normal.

273
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
We will act one hour after midnight.

274
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,679
No one is to be spared.

275
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,400
Yes, Master.

276
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,000
Your Highness, Chief Feng has departed.

277
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,760
We should depart too.

278
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,840
Yes, sir.

279
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,000
Your Highness.

280
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,200
Your Highness.

281
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,280
Why are you out of breath?

282
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,039
Prince Chang is here.

283
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,119
I smell trouble.

284
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,400
Miss Huan is trying to stop him,

285
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,280
but I don't think it's working.

286
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,359
So she asked me to give you a heads up.

287
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm here to see my own brother.

288
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,280
I don't need you servants
to pass the word.

289
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,280
Good day, brother.

290
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,440
Is there a reason

291
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,719
you come today?

292
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,799
A reason?

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
No need to pretend you're clueless.

294
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,119
Judging from your cold expression,

295
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,039
I suppose you're here to reprimand me.

296
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,599
You haven't explained to me
what happened at the autumn hunt.

297
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,440
Last night,

298
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,200
I already wanted to come and ask you.

299
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,719
But knowing your condition,

300
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,599
you must be tired.

301
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,919
So I held it in until now.

302
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,799
I guess you're unhappy
that I stole the spotlight.

303
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,159
I hereby apologize to you.

304
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Lanxi.

305
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,520
In your eyes,

306
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,320
am I just a resentful, sore loser?

307
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm just frustrated
you didn't tell me sooner.

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,200
Why did you lie to me?

309
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,359
Chang.

310
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,159
When did I lie to you?

311
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,280
I told you at the autumn hunt.

312
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Chuanyun and Chuanyu

313
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,359
helped me prepare the prey.

314
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,520
But you didn't say
how it would be prepared.

315
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,960
But, Chang.

316
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,159
You didn't ask.

317
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,919
You little brat.

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,239
You're talking back to me now.

319
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,760
Okay. Tell me.

320
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,239
You weren't at the Hot Spring Palace
the last time. Where were you?

321
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,520
What's wrong?

322
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,599
I feel light-headed.

323
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,119
Fine, fine.

324
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,320
I'll stop asking.

325
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,719
I won't ask anymore.

326
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,440
Compared with when you were younger,

327
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,479
you've certainly become more annoying.

328
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,880
You're so annoying.

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,159
Even if I'm annoying,

330
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,799
you're still my older brother.

331
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
I haven't been able to thank you yet

332
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,159
for what you did for me that day,

333
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,400
I prepared this gift for you as thanks.

334
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,640
I was just about to go give it to you.

335
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,080
I guess you do have a conscience.

336
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,880
You have to be more careful from now on.

337
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,280
Feng Ju gets jealous easily.

338
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,919
Now that you received favor
at the autumn hunt,

339
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,599
who knows what he'd do to you next time?

340
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,359
Aren't you going to see what I got you?

341
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,719
It's from you.

342
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,640
It can't be bad.

343
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,000
Even if it is, I'll still cherish it.

344
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,119
Greetings, Your Highness.

345
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,200
You clearly agreed

346
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,799
to help me keep the secret.

347
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,679
The next thing I know,

348
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,640
you sent a secret letter
to the Fountain Abode

349
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,479
wanting to investigate me.

350
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,320
I am the chief of the family.

351
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,799
The fate of the Feng family lies in me.

352
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm just trying

353
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,640
to know you better.

354
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,440
Only by knowing who you are,

355
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,440
can I make an informed decision.

356
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,960
So have you come to a decision?

357
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,400
At this present time,

358
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,159
are you "elegant"

359
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,159
or are you "secretive"?

360
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,880
Being secretive

361
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,640
is a cover.

362
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,719
If the cover is blown,

363
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,960
it will be dangerous.

364
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,320
What you just said

365
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,719
came from the Shuowen Jiezi.

366
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,919
It's an explanation for "secretive".

367
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,440
In Erya,

368
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,320
being secretive is being concealed.

369
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,440
What is hidden
can also be profound and subtle.

370
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,760
Sima Qian once appraised
Sima Xiangru's compositions.

371
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,520
"Spring and Autumn" can deduce
the subtleties of things,

372
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,039
while "Book of Changes" is meant to be
subtle but explained superficially.

373
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,280
Do I get that right?

374
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,919
Sima Xiangru was overlooked
for officialdom due to sickness.

375
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,719
I am similar in that way.

376
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,159
So I will remain hidden in the dark.

377
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,159
Rather than being in the dark,

378
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,080
why not take a lantern to light the way?

379
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,640
If you wish to be Sima Xiangru,

380
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
then I shall be Zhuo Wenjun.

381
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,559
I will hold the lantern for you.

382
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,880
I'm afraid the lantern

383
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,559
will only reveal
what I'm trying to hide.

384
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,520
I dare not.

385
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,559
From today on,

386
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,960
the Feng family will follow you,

387
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,840
whether in elegance or in secret.

388
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,520
Your Highness will lead the way.

389
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,400
That we're able to be honest
with each other

390
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,760
is what I have wanted too.

391
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,119
I vow

392
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,520
not to let Your Highness down.

393
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
It's a trap! Run!

394
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,359
I may have failed today.

395
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,599
But the Ma family will perish!

396
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,599
Thank goodness for Heroine Feng's plan

397
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,479
that saves us from annihilation.

398
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,000
It's not over yet.

399
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,760
The Soultaker Sect will not stop

400
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,160
before they get what they want.

401
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,920
I'm afraid they will attack again.

402
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,839
I have sent word
to the governor of Zhaocheng.

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,760
The Jizhou Defenders
will lend a hand as well.

404
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
Having the Defenders come is good.

405
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,760
But the Soultakers are skilled.

406
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,520
After this defeat,

407
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,680
they would surely send stronger men
next time.

408
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,520
They'd be even more ruthless.

409
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,920
I am willing to stay with the Ma family

410
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,280
and take on the enemy together.

411
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,719
That should help minimize casualties.

412
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,760
To have Tianshuang Sect's help,

413
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,839
allow me

414
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:45,520
to express my utmost gratitude.

415
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,640
Since Chief Ma
has notified the governor,

416
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,719
inform him
to relocate the female, young and old

417
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,680
back to the city.

418
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,959
War is upon us.

419
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,479
Better not to implicate the innocent.

420
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,040
I will.

421
00:17:59,239 --> 00:17:59,839
Your Highness.

422
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,000
Last night, Tianshuang Sect,
together with the Ma family,

423
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,400
managed to drive away the assassins
from Soultaker Sect.

424
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,839
Okay.

425
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,680
Also, the Abode has found out more

426
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,959
about the Soultaker Sect's
Ten Temples Devils.

427
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,280
Six of them

428
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
are heading for King Ma's castle.

429
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,280
They will reach within three days.

430
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,000
What is the skill level of those six?

431
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,119
The Ten Temples Devils
are shrouded in mystery.

432
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,000
We don't know a lot about them.

433
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,040
But we learned

434
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,680
that one of them called Chu Jiang

435
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,959
once took down five elites

436
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,640
from Mingyue Court by herself

437
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,520
and left in one piece.

438
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,160
She's in the operation.

439
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,119
Looks like

440
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,119
we'll have to make a trip
to King Ma's castle too.

441
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,880
But we're back in the capital.

442
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,119
It won't be that easy to leave.

443
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,160
Moreover, tomorrow morning

444
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,119
is the first court meeting
after the autumn hunt.

445
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,280
His Lordship has given an order

446
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,359
for all three princes to attend.

447
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,439
Then we'll use the court as a reason

448
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,160
to find an opportunity.

449
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,920
Yes, sir.

450
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:00,240
(Royal Palace of Yongzhou)

451
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,359
(Royal Palace of Yongzhou)

452
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,520
(Royal Palace of Yongzhou)
In today's court session,

453
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,560
I have something to ask everyone.

454
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,479
Presently,
the Imperial Family is vulnerable.

455
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,439
Word has it that the Empyrean Token

456
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,599
has fallen into the hands
of Prince Huang Chao of Jizhou.

457
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,520
I'd like to know

458
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,359
what Yong should do about it.

459
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,160
I think

460
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,880
we should take the opportunity
to dispatch the army

461
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,520
against Jizhou.

462
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,280
We have all the reasons
to send our troops.

463
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,680
Among the Six States,

464
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,920
Yong and Ji are the strongest.

465
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,239
By taking military action,

466
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,040
we can weaken Jizhou's power.

467
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,920
I concur with
Minister Wang's suggestion.

468
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,520
Father, I have some input.

469
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,239
I agree with taking military action.

470
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,199
As long as Yong makes the first move,

471
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,199
the other four states
will have to oblige.

472
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Jizhou will be surrounded
by enemies then.

473
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,719
This way, we'd be able to subsequently
take over Jizhou.

474
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,439
Prince Ju is right.

475
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,199
As such, we could get rid of Jizhou

476
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,640
while strengthening Yongzhou.

477
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,439
Does Lanxi have any thoughts?

478
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,520
I do have something to say.

479
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,599
Just as Minister Wang said,

480
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,280
Yong and Ji
are the world's two biggest powers.

481
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,800
However, the Six States have existed
for centuries.

482
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,359
The power levels are different,
but the disparity isn't huge.

483
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,040
If we go to war with Jizhou,

484
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
win or lose,

485
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
it won't be either of us

486
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,280
that will benefit from the fight.

487
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,719
So in my opinion,

488
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,520
we shouldn't take action against Jizhou.

489
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,359
Rather, we should take a neutral stance.

490
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,000
Take a neutral stance?

491
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,160
People would make fun of us.

492
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,359
Lanxi,
why should we let others get the praise

493
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,839
while we take the back seat?

494
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Taking a neutral stance
doesn't mean we don't do anything.

495
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,119
Presently, the other states
are ready to make trouble.

496
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,160
We should take this time
to fully prepare ourselves.

497
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
Gather our strength quietly.

498
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,920
According to you,

499
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,319
how should we prepare then?

500
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,239
Compared with the other states,

501
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,839
Yong has the advantage
of land and population.

502
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,359
I suggest

503
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,400
we implement
state-wide army conscription.

504
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,640
With cities as units,

505
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,160
temporary armaments
will be distributed to the people.

506
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,040
They will train in secret.

507
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,760
If war does break out,

508
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,520
Yong's military power will far outrank
the other states'.

509
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,439
Secondly,

510
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,239
to be battle-ready
by improving the people's livelihood.

511
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:18,520
After the war ends,

512
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
the fight
will then be about state power.

513
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:21,839
I think

514
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,880
we should encourage common merchants
and businesses

515
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,640
to get involved in state-owned
businesses like infantry and salt.

516
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,079
The increasing profits
will benefit everyone.

517
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,272
(Minister Wang of Yongzhou)

518
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,839
Prince Lanxi's ideas

519
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,640
will shake the foundation of Yong.

520
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,280
Minister Wang is right.

521
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,479
Commoners should not be allowed
to have troops.

522
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:43,479
If cities are allowed
to have their own troops,

523
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,920
who will care about royal authority?

524
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,000
It will only weaken our state
instead of strengthening it.

525
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:49,800
Nonsense!

526
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,839
I thought you would be knowledgeable

527
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,640
(Minister Qin of Yongzhou)
since you read more while sick.

528
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm appalled at what you've learned.

529
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,680
Forgive me, Father.

530
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Your Lordship,
Lanxi only wanted to help.

531
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,119
It's just...

532
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,640
Are you saying that I'm wrong?

533
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,199
Pass the order.

534
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,800
Second Prince, Feng Lanxi,
spoke out of line.

535
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,599
He is to reflect on his error
in the residence

536
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,119
and shall not be allowed to leave
for half a month.

537
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,760
Your Lordship.

538
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,640
I accept.

539
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,719
I thought
Feng Lanxi was smarter than that.

540
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,400
Who knew he'd make such a big blunder?

541
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,280
I can't be more pleased though.

542
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,760
Prince Lanxi cannot be compared with you.

543
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,359
I've looked into it.

544
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,680
Prince Lanxi suffers from tuberculosis.

545
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,319
I'm guessing
he doesn't have long to live.

546
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,800
Feng Chang, what is your problem?

547
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,680
Dare you hit me?

548
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,599
You allowed your servants
to ridicule your older brother

549
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,359
and called me by my name.

550
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,800
Shouldn't I hit you?

551
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,880
What? Do you want to report it?

552
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,959
Go ahead.

553
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,920
Tomorrow, I'll get the censor

554
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,079
to charge you
with disrespecting your brothers.

555
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,280
When Mother returns from the temple,

556
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
I'll make you pay.

557
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,319
Your Highness.

558
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,800
Those things you said at court today

559
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,640
really angered His Lordship.

560
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,040
Have you thought about it?

561
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,199
How will you handle it?

562
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,400
If he's angry,
I am here taking my medicine.

563
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,280
If he's not angry,

564
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm still here taking medicine.

565
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,560
Do you think

566
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,599
there's any difference, sir?

567
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,479
What you mean is...

568
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,079
His Lordship is here.

569
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,400
Here he comes.

570
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,719
Greetings, Father.

571
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:50,920
Save the formalities.

572
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:51,800
Yes, Father.

573
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,839
Stand up.

574
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,040
Sit.

575
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,359
I wouldn't dare.

576
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,280
Just take a seat.

577
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,640
Yes, Father.

578
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,520
Did you know I was coming?

579
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,319
Father knew I got a scare

580
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,319
during the court meeting today

581
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,920
and came to check on me.

582
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,920
That's only to be expected.

583
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,719
However,

584
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,640
since I moved out from the palace at 15,

585
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,959
this is the first time

586
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,520
you've come to my residence.

587
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,719
I've been busy with official matters
over the years

588
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,400
and have neglected you.

589
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,880
But I'm reassured.

590
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,560
Although you take after
your mother's physique,

591
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,119
weak by nature,

592
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,640
in terms of intelligence,

593
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,719
you get more of that from me.

594
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,560
Thanks for the praise.

595
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,599
The things you brought forth
today in court

596
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
did make sense.

597
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,400
But you know this.

598
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,800
The Dadong empire
set up Six States as enfeoffment.

599
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,520
It's similar to what you've said.

600
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,119
And you saw how that ended.

601
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,680
The Six States grew in strength
while Imperial Family weakened.

602
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,160
How do you explain that?

603
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,280
What I proposed

604
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,640
is not the same as what Dadong had done.

605
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,760
Dadong is in peril mainly
due to the division of power.

606
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,560
The Six States are autonomous.

607
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,760
It's difficult for Imperial Family
to oversee each state.

608
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,880
That's why it ended up like this.

609
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,119
What I proposed is the exact opposite.

610
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm trying to gather all the power
into your hands.

611
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,719
On the surface,
each city has its own troops.

612
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,520
But with this,
you can take the opportunity

613
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,199
to send your own men.

614
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,560
Not only will it not divide the power,

615
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,319
but it will also put you in control
of all the cities' troops.

616
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,520
The world would be under your command.

617
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,880
In addition,

618
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,839
although commerce is stunted,

619
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,599
it is the foundation of everything.

620
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,079
Allow merchants
to be involved in the military,

621
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,439
while the government
controls the military.

622
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,719
Work is delegated to others

623
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,959
but the credit

624
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,719
goes to the lord.

625
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,719
The art of lordship

626
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:16,880
is passed down from father to son
and kept esoteric.

627
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,439
I didn't mean to punish you.

628
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,199
It's just that,
to those elderly officials,

629
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,280
your words

630
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,479
were a little too sharp.

631
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,400
I reprimanded you

632
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,800
because I wanted to protect you.

633
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,599
I understand.

634
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,000
Take care of your health.

635
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,839
Once you're well,

636
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,520
I have big plans for you.

637
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,319
You have a task for me.

638
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,599
I should oblige.

639
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,560
But...

640
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,000
My health

641
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,520
has always been bad.

642
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
And I did get quite a shock today.

643
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,640
If so,

644
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,400
stay in the residence and recuperate.

645
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,800
We'll talk once you're better.

646
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,079
I will give the order

647
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,560
for you not to be disturbed.

648
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,439
Thank you, Father.

649
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,599
Take care of yourself.

650
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,560
You are my oldest legitimate heir.

651
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,520
I have a lot of expectations of you.

652
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,400
Take care, Father.

653
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
And with that,

654
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,520
you managed to change
His Lordship's impression of you.

655
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,760
Your Highness, you are discerning.

656
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,119
You've earned my respect.

657
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:42,760
Why did you turn down
His Lordship's appointment?

658
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,199
My father

659
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,079
is always full of suspicion.

660
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,000
Once he did give me a task,

661
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,439
if I did badly,

662
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
it would invite criticism.

663
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,479
If I did well,

664
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,520
it would make him wary of me.

665
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,599
If it were me,

666
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,880
while in my prime,

667
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,880
I watched as my sons all scramble

668
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,199
for my throne,

669
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,160
I'd probably be on edge too.

670
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,439
Besides,

671
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,800
I have to make a trip
to King Ma's castle in Jizhou.

672
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,280
This is the perfect chance for me
to sneak out.

673
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,560
I will leave today.

674
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,439
Well then, Chuanyun and Chuanyu,

675
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,880
go and prepare.

676
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:17,839
There's no need.

677
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,479
I will be going alone.

678
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,119
Although Father has given an order

679
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,040
for others to leave me alone,

680
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:25,040
the news that he came to visit me

681
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,119
would reach Ju soon enough.

682
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,760
If you two come with me,

683
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,400
it will only create more trouble.

684
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:32,760
Understood.

685
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,359
Does either of you know

686
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,800
why His Highness
is going to King Ma's castle?

687
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,199
The Fountain Abode
sent word a few days ago.

688
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,119
The Soultaker Sect had wanted
to destroy King Ma's castle.

689
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,280
But Bai Fengxi and Tianshuang Sect
managed to wreck their plan.

690
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,359
After that, the Soultaker Sect
gathered its best men

691
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,359
and headed for King Ma's castle.

692
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,920
I'm guessing His Highness is going there
for this matter.

693
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,479
For this matter?

694
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,319
Or for Bai Fengxi?

695
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,319
I think His Highness already planned it.

696
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,599
He purposely crossed His Lordship

697
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,160
in court today

698
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,359
because of Bai Fengxi, didn't he?

699
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,880
Are you saying
that His Highness and Bai Fengxi are...

700
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,040
(Jizhou boundary)
I think Master is over-reacting.

701
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,680
(Jizhou boundary)
He actually asked the six of us

702
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,040
to take on the little Bai Fengxi?

703
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,199
(Yan Luo)
Ma has moved his family to Zhaocheng.

704
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,479
I'm afraid

705
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,319
the secret manual has been moved too.

706
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,800
Don't worry.

707
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,839
I already have a plan.

708
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,800
Song Di, Tai Shan, Du Shi.

709
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,599
Listen up.

710
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:35,319
Yes.

711
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,360
(Bian Cheng, Tai Shan)

712
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,561
You three will deal with Bai Fengxi.

713
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:38,959
(Song Di, Du Shi)
You three will deal with Bai Fengxi.

714
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,920
Bian Cheng, Chu Jiang.

715
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,360
(Chu Jiang)

716
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:46,040
You will come with me
to abduct the others.

717
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,160
I've been wanting
to slay that Bai Fengxi.

718
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,800
Our mission

719
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,000
is not only to kill her.

720
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,520
Make sure
we don't disrupt Master's plan.

721
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,000
Heroine Feng.

722
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,880
I'm Sun Si from the Fountain Abode.

723
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,000
Young Master asked me to let you know

724
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,680
that the Soultaker Sect
has sent skilled fighters.

725
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,680
Six of the Ten Temples Devils
are on their way.

726
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,599
Please be on the lookout.

727
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,599
That Black Foxy.

728
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,560
Thanks for the heads-up.

729
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,319
Young Master also said,

730
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,079
if you need any assistance,

731
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,599
the Fountain Abode will do what we can.

732
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,479
There is something

733
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,959
that I need your help with.

734
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
What a huge commotion.

735
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,959
I appreciate the effort.

736
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,959
Bunch of cheap tricks.

737
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:41,400
You wench.

738
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,079
Even in the face of death,

739
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,760
you refuse to behave.

740
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,040
Die!

741
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,760
(Zhaocheng, Jizhou)

742
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,520
Thank you, Commander Wang.

743
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,880
The enemies have been wiped out.

744
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,359
The Ma family is safe and sound.

745
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,280
The Soultaker Sect

746
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,920
would even harm
the powerless family members.

747
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,640
I'm grateful
for the Fountain Abode's help too.

748
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,680
You're welcome, commander.

749
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,640
Greetings, Young Master.

750
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm Fengxi of Fountain Abode.
Good to meet you, Commander Wang.

751
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,479
So it's you, Mr. Fengxi. It's my honor.

752
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,439
Why are you lot here?

753
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,079
It was Miss Feng's idea.

754
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,839
She guessed the Soultaker Sect
would come after the family members,

755
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:57,199
so she asked us to set up an ambush.

756
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Once we rendezvous with you,

757
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,319
we'll head to King Ma's castle together.

758
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,760
This time,

759
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,760
even I was not informed.

760
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,560
All right.

761
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,959
Send word to say we're safe.

762
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,119
Will do.

763
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,599
The men you sent to Zhaocheng

764
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:28,599
will not be returning.

765
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,560
You thought you played me.

766
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,520
But in fact, you walked into my trap.

767
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,839
Surprised?

768
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,000
How dare you wreck Master's plan?

769
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,160
Today,

770
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,599
you will die here!

771
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,120
Langhua.

772
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:30,479
Are you okay?

773
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:43,919
Jiurong!

774
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,120
Jiurong, you...

775
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:45,840
I'm fine.

776
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,280
A man of the Xiu clan will not let
a woman be harmed

777
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,399
so long as we're alive.

778
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,760
Langhua!

779
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,840
Father.

780
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,399
Master!

781
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:38,520
I'm fine.

782
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,360
Master, here's a Buddha Pill.

783
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,040
Take it.

784
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,760
Are you okay?

785
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,239
I don't like to kill.

786
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:55,919
But today,

787
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,520
you're forcing my hand.

788
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,195
(Royal Horsemanship)

789
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,280
Father.

790
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,520
- Father.
- Master.

791
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,199
Master!

792
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:56,919
Master.

793
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:58,239
Langhua, take master away from here.

794
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
But you're injured too, Xiyun.

795
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,439
It's just a little scratch.

796
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,399
Hurry up and go.

797
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,199
Go!

798
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,040
(Immortal Fame and Virtue)

799
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,600
Go.

800
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,719
The secret manual.

801
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,520
You killed my brothers today.

802
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,239
I will make you pay for it.

803
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,639
Sure.

804
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,879
Bai Fengxi, you have nowhere to run.

805
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,479
I'm not running.

806
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,639
First, I'm going to
send the four of you to hell.

807
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,679
You're staring death in the eye.

808
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,239
Just give up the brave front.

809
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:22,959
(Black Foxy.)

810
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
(I've been waiting for you.)

811
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,080
Are you Hei Fengxi?

812
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,479
Mind your own business.

813
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,280
What did you give me?

814
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,000
Poison to send you along the way.

815
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,280
Arson to you. Honey to me.

816
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,760
The poison tastes pretty good.

817
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,320
Is the scratch on her left arm

818
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,040
made by you?

819
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,000
Let me leave the same scratch on you.

820
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,239
You'll know then.

821
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,159
I've been looking for you.

822
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,239
I will let you pay

823
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,919
for the silk string cut on her.

824
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,840
Mr. Feng.

825
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,719
I will deliver the Ma's secret manual

826
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,879
back to Chief Ma tomorrow.

827
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,879
What brings you here, Mr. Yu?

828
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,000
Mr. Yu?

829
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,719
Are you Mr. Yu?

830
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:21,919
That's me.

831
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:25,280
I was originally going
to see Huang Chao in Jizhou.

832
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:26,239
But on the way,

833
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,800
I heard
Heroine Feng was at King Ma's castle.

834
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,800
So I hurried here to see

835
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,959
who this world's oddest woman
as described by Huang Chao is.

836
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,040
The world's oddest woman?

837
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:39,679
Huang Chao sure likes to come up
with monikers.

838
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,399
Still, what a coincidence.

839
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,320
I've been wanting to meet you, Mr. Yu.

840
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,719
I didn't expect we'd meet like this.
