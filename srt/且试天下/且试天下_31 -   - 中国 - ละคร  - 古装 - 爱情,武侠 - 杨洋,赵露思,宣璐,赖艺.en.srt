=Episode 31=

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,120
I know that I'm not capable enough

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,120
to be selected, Your Lordship.

22
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,559
Hence, I shall give up.

23
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:49,879
Please take account

24
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,680
of my gracious act, misters.

25
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,319
If you can do a business with me,

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,519
I'll be more than grateful.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,080
I shall leave first.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,920
(Ceaselessly Neutral)

29
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,680
Mr. Shan is purposeful indeed.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,040
Prince Huang.

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,399
What do you think?

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,960
(Ceaselessly Neutral)

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,759
As I see it,

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,160
the Six States

35
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:16,759
emphasize the vision.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
Those who prioritize a city

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,839
survive on the city.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,679
Those who prioritize a state

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,679
are able to sense evolution.

40
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,119
And those who prioritize the world

41
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,000
can bless and rule the world.

42
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,039
This person must possess
the character of a king

43
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,039
who is true to his words.

44
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,639
Prince Huang, you're indeed remarkable.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,440
Please have a seat.

46
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,479
What about Prince Lanxi?

47
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,600
In my humble opinion,

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,880
the world is still

49
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,679
about fate.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,440
Fate?

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,720
Are you saying

52
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,919
everything is arranged by heaven?

53
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,919
A nation's fate concerns

54
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,720
the people's livelihood,
the people's opinion,

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
and the emperor's capability.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,279
Fate is found

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,839
among the officials and the people.

58
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,559
Whether

59
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,720
it's a person,

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,080
a city, a state,

61
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,360
or a nation,

62
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,759
it requires

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,119
the people who form the base

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
and the emperor's capability.

65
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,199
Fate, it is.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,119
What kind of fate

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,919
would you think that be?

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,399
Peace in all ages.

69
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,279
Peace in all ages?

70
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,479
Prince Lanxi,

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
it would be interesting

72
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
for the people, then.

73
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,240
I wonder

74
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,119
what Your Lordship thinks
of our answers?

75
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,080
You're all especially privileged people.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,720
In the future,

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
the state affairs
of the world will naturally

78
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,919
be closely related to you.

79
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,679
My question happens

80
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,119
to be related to the people.

81
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,639
Gentlemen,

82
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,240
come with me.

83
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,480
Isn't this Cangmang Endgame?

84
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:24,279
Indeed.

85
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,720
Ten years ago,

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,720
Old Taiyin and Old Tianji left

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
this Cangmang Endgame

88
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,079
in Mount Cangmang of Youzhou.

89
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,399
It was said that their predictions

90
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,119
about the world are hidden

91
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,000
within this game of Go.

92
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,880
So I'm planning to use this game of Go

93
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,119
to test four of you.

94
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,959
The final winner will be

95
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,320
my son-in-law.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,559
My father has been to Mount Wu

97
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,959
to search for Old Taiyin's legacy.

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,320
But he didn't even get
to meet Old Taiyin.

99
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
While I'm no match for my father,

100
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,160
how can I compete

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
with Prince Lanxi and Prince Huang Chao?

102
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,440
I thought today's liberal arts test was

103
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,440
about text or poem writing.

104
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,040
I didn't expect it to be a game of Go.

105
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,600
I could take the challenge
if it were poems or lyrics.

106
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,559
But...

107
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,320
Your Lordship,

108
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,920
it looks like I'm not fated
to marry the princess.

109
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,880
I'll forfeit my rights.

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
Your Lordship,
I'll forfeit my rights too.

111
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,839
Gentlemen,

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
please go ahead.

113
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Prince Huang Chao and Prince Lanxi.

114
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,160
Are you confident in ending this game?

115
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,399
Prince Lanxi,

116
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,880
are you willing to play with me?

117
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,839
Of course.

118
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,559
Prince Lanxi,

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,600
let's decide who starts first.

120
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,119
Prince Huang, you're in a high position

121
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,720
while I'm only a marquis.

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
Since you're ahead in the world,

123
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,279
it's natural for you
to make a move first.

124
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,200
It's mealtime.

125
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,799
Mealtime.

126
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,079
His Highness and His Lordship
have reached an agreement.

127
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,399
We'll take action tonight.

128
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,399
Please make your preparation.

129
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,480
I've already made the arrangement
at the dungeon.

130
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,839
After you have rescued those
from Tianshuang Sect,

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,959
someone will come to your aid.

132
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:46,600
Yes, Your Highness.

133
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,839
Disguise as Marquis Yongping's men

134
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,480
and wait for the arrival
of Royal Army there.

135
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,839
You must not

136
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,239
let any disciples of
the Tianshuang Sect escape.

137
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,839
You must let the Royal Army
witness them as proof.

138
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,959
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
You'll be handsomely rewarded
after you complete your task.

140
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,239
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,040
Go now.

142
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,559
When His Lordship is in rage,

143
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,399
those from Tianshuang Sect
will lose their heads.

144
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,200
The relationship
between His Lordship and Prince Lanxi

145
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,519
will be irreconcilable, then.

146
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,320
When that happens,

147
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,679
Prince Lanxi will have no power
to save the situation.

148
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,440
I guess Lanxi will regret trying

149
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,640
to marry the princess.

150
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,000
But I don't think

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
I'll be able to see how he reacts.

152
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,600
After all, we're not certain

153
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,119
if he can return to Yongzhou safely.

154
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:04,959
Chunran,

155
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,000
why are Mr. Huang Chao
and Mr. Lanxi still not making

156
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,480
their move until now?

157
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,559
Father,

158
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,320
I think

159
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,640
wise men think a lot
while foolish men don't think much.

160
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,239
I'm afraid they've played no less than

161
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,399
a hundred games in their head.

162
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,479
Prince Lanxi,

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll make the first move, then.

164
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,840
Master Bai, we're here to rescue you.

165
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,559
Hurry!

166
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Hurry up.

167
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,559
Let me help you.

168
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,200
Quickly now.

169
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,039
There are too many of us.

170
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,719
We must split ways.

171
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,440
You go first.

172
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,280
Father, it's too dangerous.

173
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,760
Let's go together.

174
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,799
Go, and I'll cover all of you.

175
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,679
Father!

176
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,400
Go now!

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,919
- Come on, let's go.
- Father.

178
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,080
Hurry.

179
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,599
Are you really going to stay?

180
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,479
I'm just a jade carver.

181
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,799
I may have offended
the Lord of Yongzhou,

182
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,719
but it wasn't grievous enough
to be put to death.

183
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,039
But if I escape the dungeon with you,

184
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,599
the crime would be even greater.

185
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,719
Master Bai, let's go.

186
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,039
Let's go.

187
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,359
(I must not take Feng Lanxi lightly.)

188
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,400
(He could actually
see through my deception)

189
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,280
(and not fall for it.)

190
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,080
(Huang Chao indeed has
the capability to rule the world.)

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,599
(Not only does he have
high political ideals,)

192
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:21,239
(but there are also
indistinguishable schemes.)

193
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,760
Over there!

194
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,559
Hurry! Go that way!

195
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:46,799
This way.

196
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,479
Prince Lanxi,

197
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,840
that was testing the water just now.

198
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,760
The real battle starts now.

199
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,640
Your attack is quick and forceful.

200
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,039
You march ahead boldly.

201
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,119
Don't tell me

202
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,559
this is your way of being an emperor?

203
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,280
Using the Go board as my world
and the pieces as my people,

204
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,520
it will be a game
of life and death between us.

205
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,799
Your Highness, the plan went well.

206
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,640
There was a jailbreak.

207
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
Everyone from Tianshuang Sect
was rescued.

208
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,320
Well done!

209
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,280
Send someone to inform Zhang Zhongge

210
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,200
to capture them.

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,719
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,479
Young man,

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,159
we're done changing our clothes.

214
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,200
Jiurong, Langhua, and the rest

215
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,239
are still waiting for us.

216
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,479
Can we leave the city now?

217
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,320
His Highness said
someone would escort us.

218
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,200
Let's wait for a while.

219
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,760
Take him away.

220
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,679
Prince Chang,

221
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,080
what's wrong?

222
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,080
You were tricked.

223
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,479
He's from Feng Ju's fraction

224
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,760
to set Lanxi up

225
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,359
by abducting all of you.

226
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,479
What should we do now?

227
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
What about Jiurong, Lu Shi,
Langhua and the rest?

228
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,520
I've rescued them.

229
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,640
I hope you can bear with it

230
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,799
and return to the dungeon.

231
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,239
Lanxi will return soon.

232
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:52,880
When that time comes,

233
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,080
you will be released.

234
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,320
We were careless

235
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,200
to fall for the enemy's trick.

236
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,239
We'll wait for Prince Lanxi
to come back.

237
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,599
Thank you, Prince Chang.

238
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,880
Lanxi never fails to plan ahead.

239
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,320
He knew Feng Ju was up to no good.

240
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,200
So he asked for my help.

241
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,400
Yet, Feng Ju doesn't know

242
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
that there's a trap waiting for him.

243
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,760
This time,

244
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,239
he'll have to admit defeat.

245
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,520
Your Highness is a kind person

246
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,719
for helping others in distress.

247
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,159
I'll make sure

248
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,559
to convey this to Prince Lanxi.

249
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,080
No need.

250
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,080
I didn't do much to help anyway.

251
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:26,840
If you want to tell him,

252
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,520
just deliver a message to him.

253
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Tell him

254
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,880
that I'm waiting for him to come back

255
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,960
to play a game of Go.

256
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:38,919
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,719
Cangyi, be quick.

258
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,000
Fly to Youzhou quickly

259
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,760
to tell His Highness this piece of news!

260
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,440
Prince Lanxi,

261
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,320
how can you defeat me

262
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:53,599
if you only defend?

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,119
One needs to fight to take control
of the world instead of defending it.

264
00:13:59,119 --> 00:13:59,960
Is that so?

265
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:08,640
Do you really think

266
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,479
you can turn the table like this?

267
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:12,080
Before the time is up,

268
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,239
it's hard to tell who's the victor.

269
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,080
You shall see

270
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,400
how I slay the dragon with this move.

271
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,719
My men have been arrested?

272
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,159
They were arrested
by Prince Chang's men.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm afraid Feng Lanxi
was behind this again.

275
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,719
It looks like Feng Lanxi
had a backup plan.

276
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Are those
who have been captured reliable?

277
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,200
Yes.

278
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,599
Prepare to leave the capital.

279
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,599
Prince Huang,

280
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,640
defending is to find a way to attack.

281
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,919
I kept defending

282
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,799
for the sake
of stabilizing the situation.

283
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,280
You failed to slay the dragon.

284
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,239
How can you defeat me

285
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,159
after you have lost
your drive and ambition?

286
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,239
You strive for the world

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
with your unswerving spirit.

288
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,039
I strive for the world

289
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,400
by making good use of everyone.

290
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,799
The Go pieces that seemed insignificant,

291
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,239
which you abandoned,

292
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,640
can even change the situation

293
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,320
at a critical moment.

294
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,919
I've learned a lot

295
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,159
from playing with you.

296
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:53,080
It doesn't matter who wins
or loses in this game.

297
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,760
What you taught me today gave me

298
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,919
a higher chance of conquering the world

299
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,799
in the future.

300
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,039
A Go board is a Go board, after all.

301
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,119
The world belongs to the people.

302
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,599
This is the intention

303
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,679
of our predecessors,
Old Taiyin and Old Tianji.

304
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,520
If you can understand this,

305
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,000
the people

306
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,080
will not suffer

307
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
if either of us leads the world.

308
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,200
I understand that now.

309
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,479
However,

310
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,840
I still want to end this game with you.

311
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,919
Please.

312
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,719
I lose this round.

313
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,079
In that case,

314
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,119
Prince Huang Chao has won today.

315
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,160
Thank you, Lord of Youzhou.

316
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,319
In that case,

317
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,239
those from Tianshuang Sect

318
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,239
are in the dungeon?

319
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,520
According to my secret observation,

320
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,040
they don't seem keen on escaping.

321
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,560
We must investigate
those black-clothed men

322
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,119
who wanted to break them out
of the dungeon.

323
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,199
But it seems

324
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,319
that Lanxi knows where the line is.

325
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,560
Next,

326
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,959
we shall see his choice in Youzhou.

327
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:20,680
It's all ended?

328
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,199
Yes.

329
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,599
What about Master and the rest?

330
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm sure Father will release them

331
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,199
after knowing today's result.

332
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,199
Zhong Li will escort them back

333
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,280
to Tianshuang Sect.

334
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:36,959
Thank you.

335
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,040
I've been thinking

336
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,880
about something for a very long time.

337
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,280
But I've never spoken of it.

338
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,800
Today,

339
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,119
I don't want to miss out
on this chance again.

340
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,680
I can finally finish
what I wanted to tell you

during Lantern Festival.

342
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,920
This time,

343
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:21,479
nothing can stop me,

344
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,400
even if the world falls apart.

345
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,479
I seek only to have your heart.

We will never be apart.

347
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,959
This is what
I've always wanted to tell you.

348
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,880
It's also something
I should've told you earlier.

Young Master,

384
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,400
we have news
from the capital of Yongzhou.

385
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Feng Ju's plan has failed.

386
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,719
Feng Lanxi had a backup plan.

387
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,439
Feng Ju is useless now.

388
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,040
And Feng Lanxi gave up on the princess

389
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:57,920
to return to the capital of Yongzhou.

390
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,560
Lord of Yongzhou

391
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,800
may not let him have a good time.

392
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,959
That's strange.

393
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:05,959
Without Yongzhou,

394
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,479
how is he going to conquer the world?

395
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:09,880
Now,

396
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,079
the fight for the title of Heir
has officially begun in Yongzhou.

397
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,599
He wouldn't have time
to conquer the world.

398
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,560
Then I shall wait

399
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:18,599
for Prince Huang to marry Hua Chunran.

400
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,640
Then we'll combine the army forces
of Jizhou and Youzhou

401
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,479
to conquer the world.

402
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,959
The Cricket army has expanded
to 5,000 people.

403
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,079
It's still not enough.

404
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,959
With Huang Chao's capability,

405
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:30,119
he'll need five years the most

406
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,560
to attack the Imperial City.

407
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,959
Before that,

408
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,040
we must expand the Cricket army
to 20,000 people.

409
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,160
I understand.

410
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,560
Young Master,

411
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,479
while spying on the prison breakout
in the capital of Yongzhou,

412
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:42,479
I noticed

413
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,599
the jade carver
you've been searching for

414
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,680
is locked in the dungeon too.

415
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,520
What?

416
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,880
But I don't think

417
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,239
he'll run into Bai Jiande

418
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,160
since the dungeon is huge.

419
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,680
Many things happened
due to coincidence.

420
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,000
We must not be careless.

421
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,560
I want you

422
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,199
to go to Tianshuang Sect
with me these few days.

423
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,479
Noted.

424
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,959
Your Lordship,

425
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,640
a letter from Youzhou.

426
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,880
It says

427
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,680
Princess Chunran of Youzhou has chosen

428
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,760
Prince Huang Chao of Jizhou.

429
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,079
The wedding ceremony
will be held in the near future.

430
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,839
Lanxi is willing to give up

431
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,160
on marrying the Princess of Youzhou.

432
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:30,439
It looks like it's very likely

433
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,520
that he established the Fountain Abode

434
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,479
to protect himself.

435
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,199
What do you think?

436
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,520
I think

437
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,359
Prince Lanxi values more
his relationship with you.

438
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,959
You have a point.

439
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,119
I want you

440
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,640
to order Zhang Zhongge

441
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,160
to release

442
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,719
those from Tianshuang Sect.

443
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,400
There's no need to lock them up anymore.

444
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,479
Yes, Your Lordship.

445
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,400
His Highness sent someone
to deliver this letter.

446
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,959
He instructed me to deliver it to you.

447
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,800
What is this?

448
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,680
What nonsense is this?

449
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:25,839
Is His Highness really planning

450
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,319
to leave like this?

451
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,560
His Highness said

452
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,920
Chancellor Ren is already old

453
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,479
and is an important minister to him.

454
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,239
Under such circumstances,

455
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,520
he can only request Chancellor Ren

456
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,599
to disarm and retire.

457
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,479
His Highness feels guilty about this.

458
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,520
He hopes you can forgive him.

459
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,680
He also told me

460
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,959
to let you know

461
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
that Liangcheng is a good place to go.

462
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,000
But

463
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,800
His Highness didn't marry Hua Chunran

464
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,560
and failed to get Youzhou as his support

465
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
to go against His Lordship.

466
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,560
If he returns to court,
he won't have as much power.

467
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,760
Prince Chang has given up
on being an Heir.

468
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,920
But Prince Lanxi and Prince Ju's fight

469
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,880
has only started.

470
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,719
I suppose His Highness
is giving up completely.

471
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,359
He went to Youzhou

472
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,160
not only because of having no choice

473
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:15,800
but also

474
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,119
because he wanted to leave completely.

475
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
His Highness said

476
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,560
the Feng family is deeply rooted
in Yongzhou.

477
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:23,920
After this,

478
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,800
you don't have to worry.

479
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,719
His Lordship won't cause trouble
for the Feng family.

480
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,040
The Feng family can use this chance

481
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:30,920
to serve His Lordship.

482
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,479
As for the token of loyalty,

483
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
His Highness has prepared it for you.

484
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,239
With this list,

485
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,000
one can control

486
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,040
the Fountain Abode

487
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,400
His Highness handed to His Lordship.
Am I right?

488
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,479
Yes.

489
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,800
His Highness said

490
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,040
you're a heroic woman.

491
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,959
The power of Fountain Abode is huge.

492
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,400
His Lordship took it for his own use.

493
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:03,000
Naturally, no one
can control Fountain Abode.

494
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,760
Also, His Lordship is worried

495
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,680
about letting someone else

496
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,119
manage such an organization.

497
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,599
So His Lordship only has two choices.

498
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,319
First, it's Yuan Lu, Eunuch Yuan.

499
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,560
Second, you.

500
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,239
I understand.

501
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,000
Chancellor Ren and Official Feng,

502
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,319
we'll only meet again

503
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,479
in the martial arts world
after tomorrow.

504
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,760
Do you really agree

505
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,479
with this matter?

506
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,160
His Highness

507
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,239
made the right move in this matter.

508
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:54,959
Wuyuan,

509
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,599
are you leaving?

510
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,359
According to Lord of Youzhou,

511
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,800
the wedding ceremony will be in Youzhou.

512
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,160
I have something to take care of.

513
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,319
After you're married,

514
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,640
I'll definitely return.

515
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,160
Also,

516
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,040
you should wait

517
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,239
if you intend to ask Youzhou

518
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,520
to conquer Qingzhou.

519
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,479
What should I wait for?

520
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,000
An opportunity.

521
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,439
But it won't take too long.

522
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,160
I shall wait and see, then.

523
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,694
(Tianshuang Sect)

524
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,000
Are you waiting
for Martial Sister and Mr. Feng?

525
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,920
Mr. Feng sent his hawk
to deliver a message

526
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,640
and said they'll arrive
within these few days.

527
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:38,119
Why are they still not here yet?

528
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,760
Don't you know people forget
to come home if they have too much fun?

529
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,239
I'm sure they wish
they could come back later.

530
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,719
They forget to come home
because they have too much fun?

531
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,640
I thought only ignorant people do that.

532
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,160
You're too young to understand.

533
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,160
Martial Sister could come back
with her eyes blindfolded.

534
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,239
Come on. Stop waiting here.

535
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,880
No, I want to wait for them here.

536
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,520
Pu! Langhua!

537
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,040
Martial Sister!

538
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,040
Come here.

539
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,640
I guess only you care about me.

540
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:12,760
Let me take a look at you.

541
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,239
I'd like to thank you for your help
in the capital of Yongzhou.

542
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,719
Tianshuang Sect got into trouble
because of me.

543
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,280
I was only making up
for my mistake. That's all.

544
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,839
There's no need for you to thank me.

545
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,520
Then I'll thank you
for taking care of naughty people.

546
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:27,959
Who is she talking about?

547
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,680
Who else?

548
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,719
You're one of them.

549
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,760
After returning
from leaving the mountain,

550
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,280
your courage has grown much.

551
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,400
Just a little.

552
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:37,839
Your Highness.

553
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,520
Thank you for your hard work
in the capital of Yongzhou.

554
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,520
I've been working for you since young.

555
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,839
You gave me a life.

556
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:45,959
So it's not hard at all.

557
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,199
By the way,

558
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,520
Master Bai is waiting
for you and Miss Fengxi.

559
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,199
Let's go in, then.

560
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,719
Pu, let's go first.

561
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,599
I didn't expect

562
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,040
Lord of Yongzhou to keep his promise

563
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,040
and let us return.

564
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,839
I didn't marry the princess,

565
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,680
and I handed over Fountain Abode to him.

566
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,000
I no longer have anything that he wants.

567
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,959
So I'm harmless

568
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,520
to him now.

569
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,400
Moreover,

570
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,439
he didn't want to provoke those
from the martial arts world.

571
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,439
Since I've given him enough face,

572
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,040
he'd naturally go with the flow.

573
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,199
What's wrong?

574
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,719
In ancient stories,

575
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,280
Ne Zha carved his own bones
and flesh to repay his parents.

576
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,560
You're doing the same too.

577
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,119
To have peace in a royal household,

578
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,680
there mustn't be
any suspicions among the family.

579
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:56,959
It's exhausting.

580
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,760
Indeed, it is.

581
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,520
But I'm fortunate to have met you

582
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,760
along the way.

583
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,319
Master.

584
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:22,239
You're back.

585
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,479
Is everything all right?

586
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,239
All is good.

587
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,199
Master Bai,

588
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,920
I'm sorry about what you had
to go through in the capital of Yongzhou.

589
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,560
Mr. Feng, no need to feel guilty.

590
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,920
You took good care

591
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,239
of Tianshuang Sect
in the capital of Yongzhou.

592
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:34,880
I've also

593
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
let those from Fountain Abode stay here.

594
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Thank you, Master Bai.

595
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,239
Do you have any plans for the future?

596
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,319
I still have to return
to the capital of Yongzhou.

597
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,439
It's my home, after all.

598
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,319
Since Huang Chao
is marrying Hua Chunran,

599
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,880
his world conquest will happen soon.

600
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
I hope

601
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,920
you can protect the people

602
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,400
when that happens.

603
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,199
I shall bear

604
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,640
your teachings in mind.

605
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,400
Master,

606
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,319
rest assured.

607
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,319
If he disregards the people

608
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,400
to conquer the world,

609
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,959
I'll be the first to teach him a lesson.

610
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,040
Gosh.

611
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,079
The happiest thing in my life

612
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,880
is to see both of you
finally being together.

613
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,040
Mr. Feng,

614
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,400
I hope

615
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,959
you can take good care of my disciple.

616
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,560
I'll make sure she's well-fed.

617
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,680
You had a long journey.
You should get some rest now.

618
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,479
Yes, Master.

619
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,622
(Cangyun Pavilion)

620
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,920
I shall see you off

621
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,599
with tea instead of liquor.

622
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,560
After we go separate ways,

623
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I don't know when we'll meet again.

624
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:15,013
(Cangyun Pavilion)

625
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,680
I have faith

626
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,280
that we won't have to wait too long

627
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,800
with His Highness' capability.

628
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:22,560
You should just wait
in Liangcheng patiently.

629
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,760
His Highness may need your help

630
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,920
in the future.

631
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,719
That is, of course.

632
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,599
The Feng family
and His Highness are one.

633
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
I shall take my leave now.

634
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:38,127
(Cangyun Pavilion)

635
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,400
Official Ren, have a safe journey.

636
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:52,521
(Cangyun Pavilion)

637
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,920
After being an official for decades,

638
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,319
he only leaves with a few packages.

639
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:59,160
This must be how helpless officials are.

640
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,719
Miss, it's time for us to leave too.

641
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,680
Let's head to the palace.

642
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,239
The palace?

643
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,439
His Lordship is waiting for me.

644
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,719
So is His Highness.

645
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,359
Do you really feel at ease
in letting him go?

646
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,439
This rebellious son of mine

647
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,319
may cause me a lot of headaches,

648
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,880
but he has a big heart.

649
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,719
He had handed over everything now.

650
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,359
He's also frail from illness.

651
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,640
He said he wanted to travel the world.

652
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,040
So I let him go.

653
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,959
I heard Feng Qiwu

654
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,359
requested an audience with you.

655
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,920
She brought the list
of the Fountain Abode.

656
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,719
It's also a leeway Lanxi left for her.

657
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,560
The Fountain Abode is very powerful.

658
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,239
None of my men can control it.

659
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,439
So she took the chance
to discuss it with me.

660
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,119
Her objective was
to protect the Feng family.

661
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:07,719
It looks like

662
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:10,399
Feng Lanxi is a sentimental person.

663
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,560
You're his father, after all.

664
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,639
Even if he left Yongzhou,

665
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,840
he still thinks about his family.

666
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,879
Stop probing.

667
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,840
I already said

668
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:26,080
no one could run from their mistake.

669
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,120
I haven't forgiven him

670
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,879
for all the things he had done.

671
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,800
I'll just pretend
I don't have a son like him.

672
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,439
He can never return

673
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,159
to Yongzhou.

674
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,800
I never intend to probe.

675
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:50,399
I know what you're thinking.

676
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,959
Feng Chang has no intention
of seizing the throne.

677
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,560
Feng Lanxi has now left Yongzhou.

678
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,560
So there's Feng Ju who will be

679
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,639
my only heir now.

680
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:00,840
Am I right?

681
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,800
But is Feng Ju completely innocent

682
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,639
in this matter?

683
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,120
He was the one who reported it.

684
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,919
He was also the one who sent people
to break into the prison.

685
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:13,320
Do you think

686
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,080
I don't know that?

687
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:17,919
Ju only wants

688
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,439
to gain your trust.

689
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:21,639
He did it for Yongzhou.

690
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:22,719
He has no intention of being disloyal.

691
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,239
Please judge it fairly.

692
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,919
I know very well

693
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,919
of these little tricks.

694
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,600
But you were right.

695
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,040
He did it

696
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,320
for the sake of Yongzhou and me.

697
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:37,919
When I go back,

698
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,760
I'll educate Ju properly

699
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,879
so he'll be more cautious

700
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,399
and not let you worry.

701
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,080
Get up.

702
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,439
If he wants to be my heir,

703
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,320
he needs to prove his capabilities.

704
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,399
There are many rebels in the south.

705
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,439
If he managed to get rid of them,

706
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:58,239
he'd have the right

707
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,439
to be my heir.

708
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,439
Your Lordship,

709
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:04,280
the bandits in the south are fierce.

710
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,320
For Ju, it'd be...

711
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,320
How can he be the pillar of the state

712
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,719
if he doesn't experience any hardship?

713
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,080
Lanxi may have left.

714
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,040
But he established Fountain Abode

715
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,040
with his own capabilities.

716
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,639
Are you saying

717
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,879
that I only have one capable son?

718
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,320
But it's your birthday

719
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,320
in a month.

720
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:23,879
All right.

721
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,040
I'll give him a month, then.

722
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:26,959
What do you think?

723
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,040
Thank you, Your Lordship.

724
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,159
Aren't you staying here today?

725
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,120
Huang Chao of Jizhou wants
to marry the Princess of Youzhou.

726
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,280
After they get married,

727
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,360
the situation of the world would change.

728
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,120
I should think of a countermeasure.

729
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Moreover,

730
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,000
didn't you already get what you wanted?

731
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:58,520
I shall see you off, Your Lordship.

732
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,639
I didn't expect you'll be here

733
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,800
after my retirement.

734
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,520
I happened to pass by.

735
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:12,040
So I came to visit you.

736
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,399
Well, you come at the right time.

737
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,639
Yes.

738
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,879
I must be fated to meet you.

739
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,840
Mr. Yu,

740
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,360
I got my hand on something
many days ago.

741
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,239
I wonder if you know its origin.
