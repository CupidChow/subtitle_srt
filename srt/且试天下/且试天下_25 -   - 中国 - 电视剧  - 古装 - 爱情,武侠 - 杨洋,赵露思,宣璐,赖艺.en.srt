When His Lordship wants
to get you a husband,

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,720
the other States responded quickly.

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,120
Even the most prestigious
Prince Huang Chao

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,959
responded.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,120
Is it really necessary to earn
the title of the Divine Fairy?

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,680
I need the prestigious title

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,839
to stand on equal ground with them.

28
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,120
Only then can I have leverage.

29
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,360
(Besides,)

30
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,399
(Huang Chao is not my concern.)

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,040
(Eight Pagoda)

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,720

(Young Huang Chao)

(Young Feng Xiyun)

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,440
Buddy,

36
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,249
do you know where

37
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,919
(Young Feng Lanxi)
Lord Feng's Huang Crown is?

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,720
I get it now!

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,720
You are playing the statues.

40
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,240
The first to move loses.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,720
Buddy, am I right?

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,160
All right, stop poking me.

43
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,679
All right, I lost.

44
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,559
I shouldn't have
played this game with you.

45
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,639
Why do you ask about the crown?

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,639
My father says this is the Eight Pagoda.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,240
Lord Feng's ceremonial crown
is kept inside this pagoda.

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,880
Emperor Weilie named it himself.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,960
The Huang Crown is more
distinguished than the Feng Crown.

50
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,080
I want that crown.

51
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,160
Lord Feng only had one crown.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
When Lord Feng passed away,

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,119
the body was buried inside
the Eight Pagoda by Emperor Weilie.

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,000
It was decreed that Lord Feng
had returned to heaven

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,119
and the crown must never be worn again.

56
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,160
Not even Lord Qing
who succeeded Lord Feng

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
could wear it,

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
you certainly can't wear it.

59
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,559
I like the crown. I want to wear it.

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm done with the game.

61
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:49,639
You should be

62
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,279
more attentive to the lady.

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,679
Hush, don't cry.

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,360
The crown has been
kept there for centuries.

65
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,039
It's been old and ruined by now.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,759
Miss, you were born a beauty.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,401
Only the Feng Crown is worthy of you.

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,600
Isn't that right, Xiyun?

69
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,960
I don't know about that,

70
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,600
but I do know that you lost.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,399
Five silver leaves from each of you.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,639
All you ever care about is the money.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,320
What do you even need the money for?

74
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,320
For delicious snacks.

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,760
One silver leaf is enough
to get me a dozen of drumsticks.

76
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:23,920
Let's go.

77
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,559
Is the Feng Crown pretty?

78
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:27,959
Of course.

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
An empress shows love
for all her subjects.

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
That makes the empress
the most beautiful woman.

81
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,359
Remember, you should wear
the Feng Crown meant for the empress,

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
not Lord Feng's Huang Crown.

83
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:36,799
Very well.

84
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,399
I don't want the Huang Crown anymore.

85
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,959
I want to be the most beautiful woman

86
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,519
and wear the beautiful Feng Crown.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,440
(I wonder, who will be the one)

88
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,440
(to put the crown on me?)

89
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,559
Hua Chunran?

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,799
The Divine Fairy of Dadong?

91
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,799
This sounds interesting.

92
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,880
Hua Chunran is very witty.

93
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,679
Before New Year, there were rumors

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
the greatest beauty of Youzhou
was looking for a husband.

95
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
She's been titled the Divine Fairy.

96
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:07,799
All the men from this land

97
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:08,880
will want to try their luck.

98
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,600
Moreover,

99
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,880
if she was only
the greatest beauty of Youzhou,

100
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,160
she'll only be an heir's consort

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,559
no matter who she marries.

102
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,799
But now, she is the Divine Fairy.

103
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,920
Even if she married you or Huang Chao,

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,359
her status in the marriage

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
wouldn't be beneath you.

106
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,480
(We share the same thought
on the matter.)

107
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,480
What's wrong?

108
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
News from the Royal Palace of Youzhou

109
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,000
is only passed among the royal families.

110
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
How did you know all this?

111
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,720
This is huge.

112
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,600
It's already made a wave.

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,799
Everyone in the martial arts world
talked about it.

114
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,480
By the way,

115
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,200
what is your thought

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,799
on Youzhou's greatest beauty?

117
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:49,920
There are talented minds everywhere.

118
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,640
A heroine is nothing to be surprised at.

119
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,559
Hua Chunran may be smart,

120
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,359
but she is still inferior

121
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,799
to Princess Xiyun.

122
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,359
When you reunite with Princess Xiyun,

123
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,559
your jaw will drop so hard.

124
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,079
She's not who you think she is.

125
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:11,600
Xiyun had made
a name for herself long ago.

126
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,519
Do you think

127
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,200
Hua Chunran can outmatch her?

128
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,279
Of course not.

129
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,000
I...

130
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm done with you. I'm going out.

131
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,320
But...

132
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:39,799
Your Highness,

133
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,119
is Miss Fengxi

134
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,760
jealous of her?

135
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,359
Jealous?

136
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,480
That is a good sign.

137
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,160
It means she cares about me.

138
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,640
That's how it goes

139
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
in the novels.

140
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,480
Your Highness,

141
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,880
you need to read the whole story!

142
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,480
There is more after that.

143
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,519
Don't you remember?

144
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,200
There's more?

145
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,839
You must figure out a way

146
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,880
to cheer Miss Fengxi up.

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,279
A jealous girl is an essential element

148
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,600
of the story.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,119
It could take the guy

150
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,600
around a week to cheer her up.

151
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
In the worst cases,
jealousy turns into hatred.

152
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,720
It could be the man's demise.

153
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,440
By the way,

154
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,559
how is the camp in Qingzhou?

155
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,239
They are preparing for war.

156
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,600
They will close in
on Liangcheng in a few days.

157
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,279
Your Highness,

158
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,519
what should we do?

159
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,359
War

160
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,320
seems inevitable.

161
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,679
The better plan

162
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,200
is to have a truce treaty

163
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,079
and avoid casualties.

164
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,160
But,

165
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,519
it seems His Lordship

166
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,799
wants to wage war on Qingzhou.

167
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,079
Your Highness, how do we counter this?

168
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
The people come first.

169
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,279
While the general is away,
he must learn to improvise.

170
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,959
Our top priority

171
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,239
is to contact Xieyue
and learn about his plan.

172
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,239
If our opinions align,

173
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,440
that's for the best.

174
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,559
Yes, consider it done.

175
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,239
But,

176
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
what if he disagrees with us?

177
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,600
We have a contingency plan.

178
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,919
We must stay alert.

179
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,119
Order the Moyu Cavalry to stand by.

180
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:37,799
Have you

181
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,080
learned anything new about
the water canals of Liangcheng?

182
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,280
My men have found

183
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,359
the original blueprints.

184
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,159
They are compiling.

185
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,336
(Main Camp of Qingzhou Army)

186
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Generals.

187
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,359
Yu Ming refuses to fight.

188
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,880
We can't afford to waste more time here.

189
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
If we don't alter the drainage in time,

190
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,840
(Heir of Lord of Qingzhou, Feng Xieyue)
Qingzhou will suffer great damage.

191
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,520
(Heir of Lord of Qingzhou, Feng Xieyue)

192
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,799
Therefore,

193
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,080
we will attack Liangcheng in two days.

194
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,479
Yu Ming specializes in defenses.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,479
What is the plan?

196
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,640
Liangcheng is the most
fortified stronghold in Yongzhou.

197
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,039
But over the years,

198
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
Yu Ming has filled his pocket

199
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,919
by asking for funding

200
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,919
in the name of flood control.

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,640
To avoid inspections,

202
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,320
he built some water canals as his front.

203
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
These water canals

204
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,200
will be our opening.

205
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,159
Therefore,

206
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,000
- we...
- Brother.

207
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,520
Xiyun, why are you here?

208
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

209
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,080
At ease.

210
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,280
Dismissed.

211
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,320
Yes.

212
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,880
I got your letter.

213
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,239
I knew you were stationed
near Liangcheng.

214
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,080
So, I came right away.

215
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
Did you come from Liangcheng?

216
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,760
Yes.

217
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm not here to fight your war.

218
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm here because

219
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I want a truce.

220
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,960
Truce?

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,000
Perhaps you haven't heard.

222
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,799
Yu Ming is dead.

223
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,320
The person in charge of Liangcheng

224
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
is Feng Lanxi of Yongzhou.

225
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,159
Mr. Lanxi, the Prince Yongping?

226
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,320
It's him?

227
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,080
You have surrounded Liangcheng

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,559
to prevent a possible flood.

229
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,880
Feng Lanxi already has
a plan to overcome that.

230
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,799
I think

231
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:30,080
you should have a word
with him in person.

232
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,679
If war broke out,

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,840
it'd only exert a great cost

234
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
on Yongzhou and Qingzhou.

235
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,440
How do you know he already has a plan?

236
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,919
I saw everything.

237
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,679
It's going to work.

238
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,880
Very well.

239
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,640
I will send my envoy

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,799
to Liangcheng.

241
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,440
In that case,

242
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,840
I should get going.

243
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Stay here for the night.

244
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,960
I brought some liquor.

245
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,479
I wouldn't mind that.

246
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,400
Your Highness!

247
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
Have you found her?

248
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,400
All of our scouts in the city
are newly assigned.

249
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,200
They could only gather
so much information.

250
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,719
They haven't heard
anything about Miss Fengxi.

251
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,159
Who would have thought?

252
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,080
She cares so deeply about me.

253
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,880
She got so jealous

254
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,320
over a mere name.

255
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,000
Do not blame yourself.

256
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,200
You should start thinking
about ways to cheer her up.

257
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,799
You are right.

258
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,799
Come, tell me

259
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,840
how they do it in the novels.

260
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,479
Well?

261
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,719
After trying all kinds
of liquors on my journey,

262
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
the best of them

263
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,520
is still the Clear Water Liquor
of Qingzhou.

264
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,119
Brother,

265
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,400
you don't partake in alcohol.

266
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,320
Why did you bring the liquor with you?

267
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,719
Actually, I always bring some with me

268
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,359
when I leave home.

269
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,919
I hope to meet you

270
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,159
on your journey.

271
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
You are the best brother.

272
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,960
Has Father ever mentioned me?

273
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,280
Is he well?

274
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
Father is healthy and well.

275
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
He misses you.

276
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,559
Whenever he receives your letter,

277
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,960
he smiles with joy.

278
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,840
When he hears about your heroic feats,

279
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,200
he is proud of you
while worried about you.

280
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,280
If it wasn't for your secret identity,

281
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,320
I bet Father would have
announced to the world

282
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,440
that the gallant and famous Bai Fengxi

283
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,159
was Feng Xiyun,
the Princess of Qingzhou.

284
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,760
I am able to roam the land freely,

285
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
lead a life I want,

286
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
and do what I love

287
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,640
because I have a brother
and a father who love me.

288
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,280
Well,

289
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,159
what is going on between
you and Feng Lanxi?

290
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,559
In your letter, you said

291
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,119
you'd spend the New Year
in the capital of Yongzhou.

292
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,599
But now,

293
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,080
it seems

294
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,840
there was a reason for that.

295
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,000
Honestly,

296
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,200
it's a long and complicated story.

297
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,440
I'm not in a hurry.

298
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,520
I'll listen.

299
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
Liquor and stories.

300
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,039
How delightful.

301
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,159
I thought you were the only one
who entered the martial arts world.

302
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,280
As it turns out,

303
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,840
Prince Lanxi is actually Hei Fengxi.

304
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,119
You two are meant for each other.

305
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,280
Does he know about your identity?

306
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,080
Not yet.

307
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,440
If you ever talk to him,

308
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,119
do not tell him my true identity.

309
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,200
Of course.

310
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,159
It should be a truce
negotiation tomorrow.

311
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,200
But now,

312
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,559
it's the first meeting
for two families.

313
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,719
I want to see if Feng Lanxi

314
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,640
is worthy of marrying my younger sister.

315
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,239
No one is marrying.

316
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,799
Nonsense.

317
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,679
When you told me
the tales of you two,

318
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,799
the smile on your face was too obvious.

319
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,719
Do you think I can't tell?

320
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,119
I am your brother, after all.

321
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,200
Tomorrow, I will find an opening

322
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,640
to give him a word of warning.

323
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
I want to make sure

324
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:28,440
that he knows someone has your back.

325
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,159
Brother,

326
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,599
don't make it difficult for him.

327
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,159
You are obviously taking his side now.

328
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,640
What I mean is,

329
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,880
the fate of the two States is at stake.

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,320
Do not let my relationship
get in the way of the greater good.

331
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,200
You are still

332
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,799
just as witty with words.

333
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,000
Perhaps my worry is unnecessary.

334
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,039
No one alive is capable

335
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,640
of mistreating you.

336
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,840
I should consider

337
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,719
giving Feng Lanxi some tips
to deal with you.

338
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,679
Otherwise, he might get mistreated.

339
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,280
How can you do that to your own sister?

340
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,359
Fine.

341
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,719
That's enough from me.

342
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,359
Cheers.

343
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,599
Cheers.

344
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,479
You're finally back.

345
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,039
You were gone the whole night.

346
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,599
I can explain why I was gone.

347
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,640
Last night,

348
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,119
I...

349
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,080
(I was only away for one night.)

350
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,559
(There is no need to restrain me.)

351
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,880
(Feng Lanxi, don't overdo it.)

352
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,280
(It's not like I'm afraid to fight you.)

353
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,640
Your Highness.

354
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,479
To cheer a girl up,

355
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,479
the first step

356
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,440
is to calm her down.

357
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,039
Don't provoke her.

358
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Stop her from being jealous.

359
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,960
Otherwise, the situation
will only get worse.

360
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,479
It could escalate

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,479
into a worse argument.

362
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,280
The best way

363
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,760
to calm her down

364
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,400
is to show her
you are caring and gentle.

365
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,559
Let her feel your love

366
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,599
once again.

367
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,359
Admit your mistake,

368
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,679
and she will forgive you.

369
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,960
It's quite a lot of work.

370
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,959
You were away the whole night.
Are you hungry?

371
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,920
Did you catch a cold?
Did you sleep well?

372
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,920
(This Black Foxy is acting
like a different person.)

373
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,359
(Is he hallucinating?)

374
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
I prepared breakfast for you.

375
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,199
This is your favorite snack

376
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,439
and your favorite porridge.

377
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,479
(Kindness purposefully shown
comes with ill intent!)

378
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,280
Here.

379
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,560
I feel a little dizzy.

380
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,479
I should get some rest.

381
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,400
Now that you're back,

382
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,280
your whereabouts last night
don't matter now.

383
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm so glad

384
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
you decide to come back.

385
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,839
I understand your concern.

386
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,199
You are concerned about
Feng Xiyun of Qingzhou.

387
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,680
(He knows who I really am?)

388
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,839
(Forget it.)

389
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,680
(I guess I have no choice now.)

390
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,000
Now that you know...

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,079
I will not mention her name again.

392
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,239
I will never mention

393
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,640
Feng Xiyun again.

394
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,119
My heart belongs

395
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,800
to the heroic Bai Fengxi
of the martial arts world.

396
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,520
Feng Xiyun doesn't hold a place
in my heart anymore.

397
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,520
(Is he telling me)

398
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,680
(he won't expose my identity?)

399
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,479
(But why would he do that?)

400
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,359
(No, I must think it through carefully.)

401
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
I understand what you mean.

402
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,680
Thanks.

403
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,479
(I knew it.)

404
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,800
(He wouldn't)

405
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,280
(let it go easily.)

406
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,079
Your Highness.

407
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,599
Your Highness.

408
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,880
A messenger from Qingzhou's camp

409
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,520
sent a letter.

410
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,640
A letter?

411
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,319
Prince Xieyue wants
to negotiate a truce with you.

412
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,439
The meeting is tomorrow.

413
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,640
Prince Xieyue will be here personally.

414
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,280
Summon everyone
to the side hall for a meeting.

415
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,239
Yes.

416
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,359
I'm sure all of you are aware

417
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,439
of why we are holding this meeting.

418
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,239
What are your thoughts on the situation?

419
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,599
I think

420
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,640
Prince Xieyue already knows

421
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,839
you'd taken over Liangcheng.

422
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:51,719
His visit must be to test you.

423
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,040
I suggest

424
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,640
we use this opportunity
to show our strength

425
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,599
to deter the enemies.

426
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,599
If Prince Xieyue fears you,

427
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,319
war can be prevented.

428
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,119
I have a different idea.

429
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,719
Qingzhou's army
has surrounded Liangcheng

430
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,439
for half a month.

431
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,040
The timing of this negotiation
is suspicious.

432
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,479
Prince Xieyue must be up to no good.

433
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:08,479
I suspect

434
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,640
this is part of their plan

435
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,640
to lead troops into the city.

436
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,079
With his men on the inside,

437
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,880
they will attack us.

438
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,079
We should proceed with caution.

439
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,280
Your concerns and
suggestions are justified.

440
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,880
Prince Xieyue's sudden visit

441
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,839
is rather suspicious.

442
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,760
If we overreacted

443
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,560
before we even learned their intention,

444
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,359
it could cause contentions.

445
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,719
From what I see,

446
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,199
if he is here for a truce,

447
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,119
I should discuss it with him.

448
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
If we come to an agreement,

449
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,560
the people of Liangcheng will be safe.

450
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,199
However, a contingency plan is needed.

451
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,079
Chuanyun, Chuanyu,

452
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,119
assign the guards of Liangcheng
to the Moyu Cavalry.

453
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,880
Secure the city gate

454
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,359
to prevent an assault from the enemy.

455
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,359
I want another group

456
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,199
hidden and standing by
around the Protectorate.

457
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,359
If Prince Xieyue
does anything suspicious,

458
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,000
lock him inside that building.

459
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,359
- Yes.
- Yes.

460
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
My soldiers and I will do our best

461
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,079
to assist the two generals.

462
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,319
Fear not,

463
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,079
the Moyu Cavalry is my personal troop.

464
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,359
When you join the Moyu Cavalry,

465
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,959
you become one of us.

466
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,560
Is Your Highness going to
station troops in Liangcheng?

467
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,959
Indeed.

468
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,640
Yu Ming was notorious
for building his own army here.

469
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,599
But, we are different.

470
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,520
I am royalty.

471
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,959
Even if I mass troops here,

472
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:31,560
you are still my father's subjects.

473
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,560
You still serve
the court of Yongzhou.

474
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,959
You may have lived in Liangcheng,

475
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,359
but I'm sure you know
what your priorities are

476
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:41,359
on the court.

477
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,000
I will not let Your Highness down.

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,520
We will not fail you.

479
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
(I understand your concern.)

480
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,239
You are concerned about

481
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,199
Feng Xiyun of Qingzhou.

482
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,760
I will never mention

483
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,160
Feng Xiyun again.

484
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,199
(How does he know about my identity?)

485
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:23,800
Come in.

486
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,119
I didn't finish our conversation.

487
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,239
Is this about Princess Xiyun?

488
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,199
So, you know.

489
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:49,800
Yes.

490
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,400
You've made it very obvious.

491
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,239
Of course I know.

492
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
I made it obvious?

493
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,520
Tell me,

494
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,560
what gave me away?

495
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,319
You were gone last night,

496
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,839
and just now, you barely looked at me.

497
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,800
Isn't that obvious enough?

498
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,719
I know.

499
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,719
You're jealous.

500
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,280
When I talked about Hua Chunran

501
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,359
and Princess Xiyun,

502
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:13,959
I didn't...

503
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,000
I know what you mean.

504
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,199
I'm not jealous of them.

505
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,760
So, why have you been so cold to me?

506
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,520
My heart belongs

507
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,160
to the heroic Bai Fengxi
of the martial arts world.

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Feng Xiyun doesn't hold a place
in my heart anymore.

509
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,680
(So, he doesn't know
about my real identity.)

510
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,920
Yes, I was jealous.

511
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,199
But, I forgave you.

512
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,319
Don't take it to heart.

513
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,319
Really?

514
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:46,920
You forgave me?

515
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,359
I forgave you.

516
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,640
Rest well.

517
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,407
(Jizhou)

518
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,760
What's the special occasion today?

519
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,319
Why are you in the mood
for a game of chess, Father?

520
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,319
Do I need to pick a date
to play chess with you?

521
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,880
That's not what I mean.

522
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,880
If you ever fancy a game of chess,

523
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,880
I'll gladly join you, Father.

524
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:30,760
Is that so?

525
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,719
You were obedient as a young boy.

526
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,560
Now that you're all grown up,

527
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,439
you have your hands full with work.

528
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,839
Perhaps

529
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,199
you've forgotten my advice.

530
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Pardon me.

531
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,280
What have I done wrong?

532
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,959
Please tell me.

533
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,319
Forget it. Let's continue the game.

534
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,800
My treacherous son.

535
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,040
Taking a step back for a better chance?

536
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:29,839
Not bad.

537
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
I do not understand.

538
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,239
How did Grand Tutor Ran die?

539
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,959
I am shocked

540
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,359
that you would do such a thing!

541
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:46,880
Father.

542
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,079
Grand Tutor Ran had conspired
with the officers many times.

543
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,640
He slandered me.

544
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,520
He left me with no other choice.

545
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,160
You had no choice?

546
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,760
Do you know

547
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,800
how many have reported to me

548
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,400
about your violent behaviors

549
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,560
and your lack of mercy?

550
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,079
I covered up every accusation for you.

551
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
But from what I see now,

552
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
I've raised a monster.

553
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,400
Father.

554
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,400
Please hear me out.

555
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,079
Many nobles

556
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,880
are greedy and debauched.

557
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,560
My effort

558
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,920
got in the way of their interest.

559
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,119
They see me as a threat.

560
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,920
That was why

561
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,000
they spoke ill of me.

562
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,520
I only want what's good for Jizhou.

563
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,599
I have no personal agenda.

564
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,599
Father, please see the truth.

565
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,760
Are you giving me an order?

566
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,000
You've grown arrogant.

567
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,760
You've become heedless.

568
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,319
Are you satisfied

569
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,040
with only an obedient son

570
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,319
and not a loyal official?

571
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,719
You taught me that I should

572
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,079
know what's right from wrong,

573
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,079
and that the fate of Jizhou comes first.

574
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,400
Insolence!

575
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,520
Are you saying
I'm defending the traitors?

576
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,079
That is not what I mean.

577
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,119
I only hope

578
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,520
that you can trust your own son.

579
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,239
Father!

580
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,520
Father!

581
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,000
Father!

582
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,040
Father!

583
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,160
Help!

584
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,199
Father?

585
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,160
Wuyuan,

586
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,959
my father is saved

587
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,760
thanks to your medicine.

588
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,920
Don't mention it.

589
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,719
It's only right to help.

590
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,119
These people

591
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,760
are heartless and vile.

592
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:52,680
They would even

593
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,599
poison my father.

594
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,599
They made accusations against you,

595
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,959
but that didn't work.

596
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,000
So, they went after your father.

597
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,560
Then, they will brand you

598
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,680
a patricide.

599
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,119
When you're loathed by the people,

600
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,479
they will crown a new ruler.

601
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,119
The people would do anything

602
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,839
for their own selfish goals.

603
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,359
They want to bring me down.

604
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
I shall show them no mercy.

605
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,880
Guards.

606
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:18,920
Yes.

607
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,359
Send my words.
Muster the Skyrider Cavalry.

608
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,400
His Lordship
has been harmed by traitors.

609
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,199
He was fortunate

610
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,239
to have survived.

611
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:30,959
Today,

612
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,199
we will pray for him

613
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
and prosperity for Jizhou.

614
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,319
The tributes will
be the traitors' lives.

615
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,319
We'll cleanse them from the court.

616
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,239
Yes.

617
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:46,652
(Yongzhou)

618
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,439
Your Lordship,

619
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,959
Prince Ju wants to see you.

620
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,079
Let him in.

621
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,560
Yes.

622
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,280
Greetings, Father.

623
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,079
Long Live Your Lordship.

624
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:03,800
At ease.

625
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:04,880
Thank you, Father.

626
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,119
Ju,

627
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:09,520
do you even know what time it is?

628
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,680
I do.

629
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,800
Why have you come at this hour?

630
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:13,839
Father,

631
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,359
I've made an important discovery.

632
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,959
It concerns the House of Jade.

633
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,000
The House of Jade?

634
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:20,560
I know.

635
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
The business started out in Yongzhou

636
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,239
and they now have branches
across the land.

637
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,400
What about it?

638
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,760
Is something wrong?

639
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,520
I was investigating the taxation
at the Ministry of Revenue.

640
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,000
The House of Jade

641
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,280
is guilty of tax evasion.

642
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:34,839
There's more.

643
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,920
The House of Jade is also involved

644
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,160
in the illegal selling of salt

645
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,959
for a lucrative profit.

646
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,880
I suspect the House of Jade of treason.

647
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,079
They must be executed.

648
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,640
Please pass your judgment.

649
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,520
It's a business.

650
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,719
A businessman wants profit.

651
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,439
You can accuse him
of being cunning and deceiving.

652
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,000
But treason?

653
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:56,760
Can you prove it?

654
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,199
If the House of Jade
was a normal business,

655
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,760
I wouldn't connect it

656
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,719
with the heinous crime of treason.

657
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,160
Based on my investigation,

658
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,000
the House of Jade belongs
to an organization

659
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,479
known as the Fountain Abode.

660
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,400
The Fountain Abode

661
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,199
is known to have information
about everything

662
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,760
and they sell intel.

663
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,119
After the group was formed,

664
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:19,760
we can see traces of it
in many major incidents.

665
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,119
I am deeply concerned.

666
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,800
The Fountain Abode?

667
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,839
I've heard about them.

668
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,560
Their leader

669
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,599
is known as Hei Fengxi by the people.

670
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,800
He, Lanxi, Yu Wuyuan,

671
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,880
and Huang Chao

672
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,119
are known as the Four Gentry.

673
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Who would have thought?

674
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,680
He also founded the House of Jade.

675
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,119
Hei Fengxi is indeed

676
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,359
a force to be reckoned with.

677
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,160
A business with branches across the land

678
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,400
is working for
an intelligence organization.

679
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,760
The leader

680
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,079
is certainly capable

681
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,560
and even terrifying.

682
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,680
If he wants to start a rebellion,

683
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,199
he could be unstoppable.

684
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,959
If that's the case,

685
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,800
he is a loose cannon.

686
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,719
This is serious.

687
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,760
I'll think about it.

688
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,640
By the way,

689
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,280
your mother

690
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,400
has recently mentioned your wedding.

691
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,599
Any thoughts about it?

692
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,400
My marriage is for you two to decide.

693
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I will follow whatever
arrangement you make for me.

694
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:23,839
Very well.

695
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,800
You and Duke Liang's daughter

696
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,359
were childhood friends.

697
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,479
I'll order the Astronomy Officer

698
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,119
to determine the day of your wedding.

699
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,680
You will officially
be betrothed to her.

700
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,319
Thank you, Father.

701
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,119
You may leave now.

702
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:39,640
Rest well.

703
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,199
I take my leave.

704
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,079
Yuan Lu.

705
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
Yes, Your Lordship?

706
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,560
I want Zhang Zhongge to start
investigating the House of Jade.

707
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,560
If we have evidence of their treason,

708
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,719
arrest the owner of House of Jade

709
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,839
immediately and secretly.

710
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:00,920
And...

711
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,839
What do we do with him?

712
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,160
It'd be a shame

713
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:07,640
to destroy the Fountain Abode.

714
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:09,920
They will prove useful

715
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,119
under my command.

716
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,520
Understood.

717
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,199
Black Foxy.

718
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,119
What brings you here?

719
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,000
I have some free time.

720
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,599
I'll wait with you.

721
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:33,560
Our discussion

722
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,760
is about national affairs.

723
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,280
I thought you weren't interested.

724
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,640
I'm not interested,

725
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,479
but I don't mind being an audience.

726
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,439
I can learn something.

727
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:42,239
Are you here

728
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,959
to meet Xieyue?

729
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:45,719
Yes.

730
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,239
I heard he was a wise leader.

731
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,199
The people of Qingzhou adore him.

732
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,479
A wise leader

733
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,400
earns my admiration.

734
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,400
Very well.

735
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,760
You can wait with us.

736
00:32:59,199 --> 00:32:59,800
Your Highness.

737
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,400
Your Highness.

738
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,760
Prince Xieyue is heading
for the Protectorate.

739
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,520
He will arrive shortly.

740
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,599
How many soldiers does he bring?

741
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,000
He comes alone.

742
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:09,760
Is Chuanyun

743
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:10,880
in position?

744
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,880
He and his team

745
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,160
are standing by at the gate.

746
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,400
The scouts have left the city

747
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,760
to monitor the enemy camp.

748
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,119
If Prince Xieyue comes alone,

749
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,599
someone is backing him.

750
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,079
I want to see

751
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,239
just who

752
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,280
is backing him.

753
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Prince Xieyue arrives.

754
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,199
I am Feng Lanxi,
Prince Yongping of Yongzhou.

755
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,719
Greetings, Prince Xieyue.

756
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,719
Greetings, Prince Lanxi.

757
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,360
I've heard great things
about your talents and good look.

758
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,399
Now that we meet,

759
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:14,879
the stories are true.

760
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,399
Graceful and gentle
as the stillness of orchids.

761
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,280
I'm flattered.

762
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,320
I've heard stories

763
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,120
of your wise leadership.

764
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,320
You're adored by the people.

765
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,399
I look forward to our meeting.

766
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,280
Welcome.

767
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,600
Let's set aside the formalities.

768
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,399
Dismissed.

769
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,040
Yes.

770
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,760
Prince Xieyue.

771
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,760
Welcome.

772
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,280
Welcome.

773
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,399
Act like a proper court lady.

774
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,560
Mind the cover.

775
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,879
Stand by my side.

776
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,080
My father ordered me
to lead the troops here

777
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,879
because there was no choice.

778
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,399
Just recently, I learned that
you had come to Liangcheng

779
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,000
and taken over the city.

780
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,360
I know

781
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,760
that you are one of the Four Gentry.

782
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:21,879
You're cultured and knowledgeable.

783
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,719
You're different from Yu Ming.

784
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,399
I came to Liangcheng

785
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:27,520
to learn more about your plan.

786
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,000
If we can have peace,

787
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:33,120
our people will not suffer
the cruelty of war.

788
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,719
That is for the best of all.

789
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,399
You care for the people.

790
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,199
I'm impressed.

791
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,399
The tension and fighting

792
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:43,199
became an opportunity for others.

793
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,600
Before I came to Liangcheng,

794
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,879
I'd designed a flood control plan

795
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
based on the terrain.

796
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,239
I'd like to have your advice.

797
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,180
(Qingzhou,
Red Sea Snail River, Yongzhou)

798
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,879
If we can proceed with this plan,

799
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,320
this dam will benefit

800
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,679
countless people,

801
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,639
including those from Qingzhou.

802
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,399
This dam will prevent
the river from overflowing

803
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,320
and irrigate farmlands.

804
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,399
(Qingzhou, Red Sea Snail River, Yongzhou)
It will benefit us all.

805
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,719
The future generations

806
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,399
will be grateful for your effort.

807
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,879
However,

808
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,560
I have some questions.

809
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,840
Speak away.

810
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
The freshet is coming.

811
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,879
How do you plan to complete the dam

812
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,360
before that?

813
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,600
Without war,

814
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,120
everyone in Liangcheng can participate

815
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,399
in the construction.

816
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
The soldiers and common folks

817
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,000
will work as one.

818
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:36,360
We can complete the dam

819
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,399
before the freshet.

820
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,199
What is your goal

821
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,399
in building this dam?

822
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,320
For the people,

823
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,919
this dam

824
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,399
will prevent Liangcheng from flooding.

825
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,760
It can be used for farming,

826
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,239
thus helping the farmlands.

827
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:59,080
It's killing two birds with one stone.

828
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,000
For the nation,

829
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,879
the completion of this dam

830
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,879
will be viewed as a defense.

831
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,879
It can defend us against Qingzhou

832
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,760
and tens of thousands of soldiers.

833
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,120
Well,

834
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:11,800
what about personal agenda?

835
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,399
I am of the royal bloodline.

836
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,600
Every trouble in the world
is mine as well.

837
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:21,719
If the people thrive,
so will the nation.

838
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,840
A thriving Yongzhou

839
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,800
is

840
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,760
the best support I can have.

841
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:28,760
On top of that,

842
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,080
there is someone

843
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,120
I must protect.

844
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,639
Not bad.

845
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,159
You said I was a wise leader,

846
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,280
but I think you're even wiser.

847
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,000
You will be a great leader.

848
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,000
Don't worry,

849
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,399
my army will fall back tomorrow.

850
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
There is someone

851
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,600
I must protect.

852
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,879
The negotiation is successful.
