(I hope he doesn't take this wrongly.)

58
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,799

Black Foxy.

I've never seen you
in this sorry state.

62
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,239
I was just as surprised.

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,760
However,

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,519
fate has been fair to me.

65
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,640
You mean

66
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,799
you deserve this?

67
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,399
I mean,

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,480
I've saved you so many times.

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,959
You should help me out once

70
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,359
to make it even.

71
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,200
Fate is not as calculating as you.

72
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,720
Thank you.

73
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,399
You must be starving. Want something?

74
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,679
Never mind.

75
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,600
Boil a thick broth with some

76
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,519
Qinzhou millet

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,519
and bird's nest.

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,519
I don't get this chance very often.

79
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,839
Am I asking too much?

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,079
Not at all.

81
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,359
Do you want some ginseng fruits

82
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,600
and elixir of life too?

83
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,440
You are on a boat.

84
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,079
We have no luxurious ingredients.

85
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,320
Besides,

86
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,200
you can get what you want

87
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,600
from your beloved Miss Huan.

88
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,399
If you didn't save me,

89
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,119
I'd never cook
for you in a million years.

90
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:25,440
Chief.

91
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,559
Any news?

92
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,679
We searched everywhere,

93
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,799
but we couldn't find Prince Lanxi.

94
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
And the culprit?

95
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
They found the bodies

96
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,600
of the persons who scuttled the ship.

97
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,559
They worked for Prince Chang.

98
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,799
His Lordship has summoned Prince Chang.

99
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,640
Prince Chang?

100
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,440
It's impossible.

101
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,640
The two princes were close,

102
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
so Prince Chang wouldn't harm him.

103
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,679
Not to mention...

104
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,040
Why would he send his man

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,079
for the crime?

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,920
But given the situation,

107
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,519
Prince Ju gains an advantage

108
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,839
from the power struggle of his brothers.

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,119
Start investigating Prince Ju immediately.

110
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,320
See if he is connected to the crime.

111
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,640
What if

112
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,320
we couldn't find Prince Lanxi?

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,679
He'd...

114
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,519
He's alive

115
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,679
until proven dead.

116
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,720
Go on.

117
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,559
We must prepare for

118
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,679
Prince Lanxi's comeback

119
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,799
before he returns.

120
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,359
Yes.

121
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,279
How do you explain this?

122
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,799
Impossible.

123
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,519
This cannot be.

124
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,519
I asked, how do you explain this?

125
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,440
The persons who scuttled
the ship worked for you.

126
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,239
You know me, Father.

127
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,760
I was raised by the late queen.

128
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,000
Lanxi and I have always been close.

129
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,599
Why would I seek to harm him?

130
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,200
Even if I planned this,

131
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,320
why would I make
the evidence so obvious?

132
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,320
Father, someone is framing me.

133
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,400
This is a plot!

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,320
The evidence is compelling.

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,559
How can I not believe it?

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
Lanxi is missing,

137
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,280
I am framed as the culprit.

138
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,119
Father, do you not see

139
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,559
who gains the most from all of this?

140
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
If you want to prove your innocence,

141
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,840
find Lanxi

142
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,039
or the culprit.

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,840
You have seven days to find them.

144
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,200
After that,
you'll have no mercy from me.

145
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,760
As you wish, Father.

146
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,559
Much obliged.

147
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,200
What is it?

148
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,080
Prince Chang and Prince Lanxi

149
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,559
have always been close.

150
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,520
On top of that,

151
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,880
Prince Chang has no reason
to start a power struggle.

152
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,039
From what I see,

153
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,200
Prince Chang is
certainly not the culprit.

154
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,679
You know what I want to know.

155
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,320
Stop playing the fool in front of me.

156
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,640
Start investigating Feng Ju immediately.

157
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,520
Yes.

158
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,039
This is all we have.

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,799
Take or leave it.

160
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,840
The presentation is less than desirable,

161
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,599
but this is my first time
to make noodles.

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,880
Try it out.

163
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Slow down.

164
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
Your noodles are delicious, Mother.

165
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,479
Xi, remember that

166
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
it's the custom of the Dadong Empire

167
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,200
that on everyone's birthday,

168
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,440
the mother and her children

169
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,320
will prepare a bowl of
noodles for each other.

170
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,400
But you're still too young
to learn any cooking.

171
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,960
When you grow up,

172
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,200
make me some noodles too, do you?

173
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,080
I do.

174
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,799
If this is unbearable for you,

175
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,679
I'll have the others get
something else.

176
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:22,799
I'll finish it.

177
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,280
Over the years,

178
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,119
I've only eaten the food

179
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,200
delivered by Zhong Li and Chuanyu.

180
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,359
I've never tried anyone else's cooking.

181
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,960
I have a big family.

182
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,359
After my mother passed away,

183
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
I had a stepmother.

184
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
She was worried I might
take over the family's wealth.

185
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,440
She picked on me at every corner.

186
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,880
As precautions,

187
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,119
I had some food testers.

188
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,679
Many of them died eventually.

189
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,799
So, I could only have food
made by Zhong Li and Chuanyu.

190
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,039
That's how I've lived.

191
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,320
What about this time?

192
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,320
It's a family matter.

193
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,719
(He's always seemed like a show-off,)

194
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,599
(but even he deserves some sympathy.)

195
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll contact the Fountain Abode for you.

196
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,840
Not for the time being.

197
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,880
I'm still unsure who betrayed me.

198
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,760
Why are you traveling by water?

199
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,840
My martial siblings haven't left
the mountain for a long time.

200
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,000
I want to show them the world outside.

201
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,239
Don't feel bothered.

202
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,440
I can tell Zhong Li is loyal to you.

203
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
You need not suspect him.

204
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:33,919
By the way,

205
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,880
Miss Huan was my servant.

206
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
She's served since I was little.

207
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,440
I don't know the person.

208
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,799
Why do you bother telling me this?

209
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:03,479
Father let Feng Chang go?

210
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,960
Didn't he say anything else?

211
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,719
What now?

212
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,679
You said the plan was flawless,

213
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,239
and Father would never suspect me!

214
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,559
Sir, even if he does,

215
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,799
he needs proof.

216
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,599
I've taken out everyone
involved in this plan.

217
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,640
Sir,

218
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,280
calm down.

219
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
Words haven't gotten out,

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,320
so you must keep reflecting
in the house.

221
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,239
Pretend you know nothing at all.

222
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,239
Find the body.

223
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,440
I will not be relieved

224
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,559
until his corpse is found!

225
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,119
Our men are searching
downstream as we speak.

226
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,359
You too!

227
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,039
Yes, I'll go.

228
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,721
(Royal Palace of Yongzhou)

229
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,159
(Best wishes for your 30th birthday,
Father. From: Your son, Lanxi)

230
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,080
Have you found Lanxi?

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,520
Any news about him?

232
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,479
No.

233
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,919
But Prince Lanxi will definitely
be found and saved.

234
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,640
Who do you think did it?

235
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,280
Your Lordship must have
formed an opinion.

236
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,719
I dare not presume lightly.

237
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,320
It's been almost 20 years.

238
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,236
(Best wishes for your 30th birthday,
Father. From: Your son, Lanxi)

239
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,359
They are experiencing everything

240
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,840
that I went through all those years ago.

241
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,960
Such the work of destiny.

242
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,760
Put this aside.

243
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,599
Prince Lanxi!

244
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,359
Search over here.

245
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,320
Yes.

246
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,760
Prince Lanxi!

247
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,239
Prince Lanxi!

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,479
Father.

249
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,559
Father.

250
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:29,640
Have you found him?

251
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,520
No.

252
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,039
Father!

253
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:50,640
Father!

254
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,320
Let go of me!

255
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,799
- Let go of me!
- Father!

256
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,359
Father!

257
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,400
Father...

258
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,520
Princess,

259
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,959
I've failed you!

260
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,119
No...

261
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,880
No...

262
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,520
Oh heaven,

263
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,000
you have been unfair.

264
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,520
This is injustice!

265
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,439
I, Ren Rusong,
have never believed in fate!

266
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,319
I must see Prince Lanxi,

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,680
whether he's dead or alive!

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,160
Keep searching!

269
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,439
Keep looking!

270
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,880
Have you found the body?

271
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,000
Your Highness is still awake,

272
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,119
so I've brought supper.

273
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,520
I'm not having supper. Scram!

274
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,680
Yes.

275
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,199
It's not him.

276
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,319
Keep looking! Go!

277
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,719
Yes.

278
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:30,959
What's with all the noises?

279
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,760
You've been asleep for almost 20 hours.

280
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,160
It's time to wake up.

281
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,319
Finish the medicine.

282
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,160
I'll be glad to have some figs.

283
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:11,959
I'll get you some

284
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,760
when we make port.

285
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,599
Where are we now?

286
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:19,959
I don't know.

287
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,160
I've never been to Lianjiang.

288
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,479
I'll look out the window.

289
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,760
Are you all right?

290
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,439
I'm all right.

291
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:37,800
Are you...

292
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,599
Come on.

293
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,239
Who's at the door?

294
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,239
Go.

295
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,920
Go on.

296
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,760
Martial Sister, it's me.

297
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,280
So...

298
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,959
Where are we now?

299
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,959
At the Longtou Port.

300
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,239
Longtou Port?

301
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,079
We'll reach
the capital of Yongzhou soon.

302
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,119
Should we go sightseeing?

303
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,239
Sure.

304
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,439
Jiurong, tell everyone
we are getting off the ship.

305
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,520
Prepare some supplies.

306
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,479
Yes.

307
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,950
(Wine Store)

308
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,079
You can have it.

309
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,640
I don't eat food made by foreigners.

310
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,439
Filthy food makes you immune.

311
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,079
Besides,

312
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,079
you just recovered.

313
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,599
Brown sugar helps
replenish your strength.

314
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,719
Is this how you pass others food?

315
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,839
Don't be so fastidious about it.

316
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,017
(A Serene Abode of Grace)

317
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,119
This way.

318
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,359
Have a nice day.

319
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Please wait here.

320
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,920
A prestigious customer.

321
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,839
Dark sky and yellow soil,
monolith pure as jade.

322
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,599
Heavenly stems and Earthly branches,
the azure sea carries weight.

323
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,040
The heavenly number nine.

324
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,920
Revered, as the mountain;
followed, as the path to righteousness.

325
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,079
Sir, follow me upstairs.

326
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,880
I knew it,

327
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,079
you made a stop here
because you're up to something.

328
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,520
I just never thought

329
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,079
the famous House of Jade

330
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,640
was actually a hideout
for the Fountain Abode.

331
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,439
Young Master,

332
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,319
I'm glad you're all right.

333
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,719
Send my words.

334
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,599
I will be back
in the capital of Yongzhou very soon.

335
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:06,800
Yes.

336
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,199
Is there anything else, sir?

337
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,479
What do you think about her look?

338
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,920
A fair lady of mesmerizing beauty.

339
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,000
Well said.

340
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,560
Black Foxy, you finished your work here.

341
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,280

been spotted on Mount Xuan

482

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,439
Are you working for Feng Ju?

511
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,719
I bet you really wanted Lanxi dead.

512
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,520
No, Your Highness.

513
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:44,880
Keep searching.

514
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,439
Keep looking!

515
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,040
Find him!

516
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,160
Yes.

517
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,160
Lanxi, where are you?

518
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,719
To find my brother Lanxi,

519
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,599
Father has cut my reflection time short.

520
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:29,400
Father is worried sick about Lanxi.

521
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,359
I will increase the bounty by threefold.

522
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,079
We must find Lanxi.

523
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,000
Your Highness' love for Prince Lanxi

524
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,040
is very touching.

525
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,160
Your Highness.

526
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:41,920
Get to work.

527
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,319
Right away.

528
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,599
We found Prince Lanxi's body.

529
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,560
Really?

530
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,239
Feel free to take a look.

531
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,040
Let's go.

532
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,920
Your Highness, look.

533
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,520
Your Highness,

534
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,680
the face is a little bloated,

535
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,640
but the red mole on his elbow

536
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,719
and the callus on his hand
from all the writing,

537
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,920
these features match.

538
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,560
Even the body size is similar.

539
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,119
Get some monks and
give him a proper funeral.

540
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,079
- But Your Highness...
- It's just a ritual.

541
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,520
It won't take too much effort.

542
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,479
I will proceed

543
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,319
as we have planned.

544
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,400
"We have failed to find
my brother Lanxi.

545
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,800
I am worried and distressed.

546
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
I am willing to use my personal wealth

547
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,640
for charity and Buddhist rituals
for the people

548
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,160
to pray for my brother.

549
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,119
I hope to have Father's permission."

550
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,239
Prince Ju's love for his brother

551
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,920
is surely admirable.

552
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,640
Ever since Prince Lanxi has gone missing,

553
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:20,199
we have mobilized
over 10,000 people to search for him.

554
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,680
But even now,
we still haven't found him.

555
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,560
If such is his fate,

556
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,839
why not employ Prince Ju's plan

557
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,079
and pray for Prince Lanxi?

558
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:37,079
Perhaps we might have a better chance
of finding Prince Lanxi.

559
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:39,119
Very well.

560
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:42,520
Cut the number of
search parties by half.

561
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,680
As for the rest,

562
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:44,959
we'll follow Feng Ju's plan.

563
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,040
Your Lordship, I object.

564
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,839
We know Prince Ju
cares about his brother,

565
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,479
but the people and officers

566
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,560
have heard rumors about
the tension between the princes.

567
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:58,239
If we cut the number
of search parties by half,

568
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
I fear that people will think

569
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,839
Your Lordship favors Prince Ju.

570
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,400
They will think

571
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,719
that Prince Ju is putting up an act
to earn their sympathy

572
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,639
and later on will take
the place of the heir of Lord.

573
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,479
Insolence!

574
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,439
I believe Prince Ju is a righteous person,

575
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,679
but there are rumors circling around.

576
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:18,479
We may do charity and
conduct prayer rituals,

577
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,479
yet not in Prince Ju's name.

578
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,600
Well,

579
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,080
who should host the event?

580
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,360
Your Lordship.

581
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,840
Guanyin's Birthday is in two days.

582
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,479
Your Lordship may present
the joss sticks at Guanyin's Temple

583
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,919
and chant words of
prayers in front of the people.

584
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,080
The people will understand
your love for your children

585
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,080
and have no doubts about you.

586
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,959
I agree with this plan.

587
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:45,959
Prince Lanxi is the firstborn
of the late First Queen.

588
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,760
A grander ritual

589
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,360
will make it easier to
convince those in Imperial City.

590
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,520
The Five States can't use this
as an accusation against us.

591
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
We agree.

592
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,479
Prince Ju's letter today

593
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,479
came with a rather apparent agenda.

594
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,600
We all know he and Prince Lanxi
don't see eye to eye.

595
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,479
First, he passed out from the fatigue,

596
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,879
and now he's doing charity.

597
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,040
It doesn't matter
what the others believe.

598
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:21,000
What matters is that His Lordship

599
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,600
believes Prince Ju is innocent.

600
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,040
We've lost Prince Lanxi.

601
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,600
Minister Feng, are you

602
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,560
betting your hopes on Prince Chang?

603
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,320
I am but a woman.

604
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,600
I couldn't care so much.

605
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,199
Whoever sits on the throne

606
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,840
will need both you and me as his aides.

607
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,080
Am I right?

608
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,080
Good news?

609
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Good news and bad news.

610
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,080
The bad news is

611
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,439
my father has learned
about my accident.

612
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,600
But he's not saddened by it.

613
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,600
The good news is,

614
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:37,399
my elder brother is worried about me.

615
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,239
Chuanyun, Chuanyu,
and the Fountain Abode

616
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,199
have never betrayed me.

617
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,080
Who is the culprit?

618
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,760
My younger brother from another mother.

619
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,840
Power struggle in a wealthy family.

620
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,000
This is a tale befitting of a novel.

621
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,399
It's all the same with the protagonists.

622
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,479
They make it out alive and become
stronger after unfortunate events.

623
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,199
I hope you don't forget

624
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,360
about who saved your life.

625
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,719
Yongzhou is right up ahead.

626
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,479
Would you like to visit it?

627
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,800
I could give you a tour.

628
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,360
We made a detour to come here.

629
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,080
It's best we send them home soon.

630
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,080
Besides,

631
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:30,439
you'll be busy

632
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:31,840
when you arrive in Yongzhou.

633
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,080
I should get out of your hair.

634
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,239
Martial Sister!

635
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,959
Martial Sister, bad news!

636
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,399
Langhua hasn't come out
from her room today.

637
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,239
I knocked on her door twice,
but she didn't answer.

638
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,879
So, I busted the door open.

639
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,760
She passed out and is now

640
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,520
having a fever.

641
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,800
Let's check on her.

642
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,040
Judging by her pulse,
she couldn't adjust to the climate here.

643
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,239
That caused an enteric fever.

644
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:01,560
I can stabilize her vitals.

645
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,199
However,

646
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,040
we need a physician.

647
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,320
Let's go to the capital of Yongzhou.

648
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,840
I'll get her the best physician there.

649
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,280
I can also provide

650
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,439
temporary shelter.

651
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,280
When she gets well,

652
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,600
you may be on your way.

653
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,639
Very well, we'll go there.

654
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,080
Thank you.

655
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:19,479
Jiurong, tell the others to pack up.

656
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:20,239
We're staying in the capital of Yongzhou.

657
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,320
Yes.

658
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,879
Go on.

659
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,424
(Yongzhou)

660
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,080
Physician, how is she?

661
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,360
Physician,

662
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:51,000
is it very serious?

663
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,120
She got the treatment in time.

664
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,639
If you hadn't made it in time,

665
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,199
she would have died.

666
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,080
Thank you.

667
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,719
It was faster to travel by land,

668
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,080
but we took the ship instead.

669
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,120
If we hadn't,

670
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,600
she wouldn't be sick.

671
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,560
I asked Martial Sister

672
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,639
to travel by water.

673
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,760
I'll take full responsibility for it.

674
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,320
Now is not the time for chitchat.

675
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,199
Langhua needs to get well.

676
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,159
Martial brother,

677
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:15,159
Master put me in charge

678
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,159
before we left.

679
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,600
Did you forget that?

680
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,040
Physician...

681
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,760
I'll prescribe ten doses of medicine.

682
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,159
It's two silver leaves for each dose.

683
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,760
Two silver leaves?

684
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,639
Do you want to save her or not?

685
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,639
Her heart and lung meridians
need to heal.

686
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,320
She cannot move for the next few days.

687
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,239
On top of that,

688
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,239
she must rest well
for the next ten days or so.

689
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,159
Otherwise, she will have
relapses in the future.

690
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,360
That will trouble her forever.

691
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,959
Understood. We'll follow your advice.

692
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,760
We'll have ten doses.

693
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,399
Very well.

694
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,560
Jiurong, get the medicine
with the physician.

695
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,239
Thank you.

696
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,239
We will stay in the capital of Yongzhou
for the time being.

697
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,080
Yes.

698
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,320
Go back to your room.

699
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,600
I don't want to see Gu Yu.

700
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
He is the finest among
the male disciples.

701
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,800
He should be in charge

702
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,800
when Master is not around.

703
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,479
But I was chosen instead.

704
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,120
It's normal that he is upset.

705
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,159
You're right.

706
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,959
You're the future leader.

707
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,320
You should have a generous heart.

708
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,320
I don't want to be a leader.

709
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,919
It's such a troublesome job.

710
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,239
When Master is back,

711
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:31,479
I'll go on my journey again.

712
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,439
We spent a fortune

713
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:34,360
on Langhua's medicine.

714
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,959
We still have to stay
in Yongzhou for days.

715
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,399
We barely have any money left.

716
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,560
Jiurong and I were discussing ways

717
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,879
to make more money.

718
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,840
You need not worry about money.

719
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:46,679
I will figure something out.

720
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,280
Go get some rest.

721
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:49,760
Yes.

722
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,919
(I wonder how Master is doing?)

723
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,760
(He never told me)

724
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,679
(it was so challenging to lead a sect.)

725
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
(And Black Foxy too.)

726
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,239
(I hope he is well.)

727
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:06,000
Prince Ju thought
Your Highness was dead for certain.

728
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,199
So,

729
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:09,280
he plans to use a random corpse

730
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,320
to prove your death.

731
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,399
The mastermind
of this plot is Wang Yuan.

732
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,439
Feng Ju knows of Wang Yuan's treachery.

733
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,399
He likes taking credits.

734
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,719
He takes risks if it's necessary.

735
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,040
That's why he keeps Wang Yuan
by his side.

736
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,959
With Feng Ju's wits,

737
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,719
he can absolve himself of everything

738
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,399
even if Father learns the truth.

739
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,639
My younger brother is treacherous.

740
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,000
He may seem reliant on Baili,

741
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,199
but if I can put up an act,

742
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,919
so can he.

743
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,520
My dear Feng Ju

744
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,320
must not be underestimated.
