=Episode 37=

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,599
You guys are headed to the borders?

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,279
But the world is in chaos right now.

22
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,760
It'll be a perilous journey.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,440
It was hard to find this clue.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't want to let go of it.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,000
You're all grown up.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,879
You know what you want to do now.

27
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,639
Oh, right. There is another matter.

28
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,760
When I was sorting through
my father's belongings,

29
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,279
I discovered the correspondence
between him and the Lord of Qingzhou

30
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:08,199
and found out about your true identity.

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,080
After that,

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,600
I learned what happened to Qingzhou.

33
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,639
We were so far away

34
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,559
that we didn't manage
to get here in time.

35
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,440
I...

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,600
Silly girl.

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,440
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,000
You've done me a huge favor
by blowing up those artilleries.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,399
Martial Sister,

40
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,960
I've kept all those letters for you.

41
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,960
If you need them,
I'll have them delivered to you.

42
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,479
The Tianshuang Sect
will always be your home.

43
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,679
Don't forget to come back and visit us.

44
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,199
Martial Sister,

45
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,679
I will always be waiting for you.

46
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,600
All right.

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,279
It's a long journey

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
to the borders.

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,759
I'll have someone escort you guys.

50
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,000
You need as many hands as you can get.

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,559
We can look after ourselves.

52
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,360
Don't worry, Martial Sister. I'm here.

53
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll take good care of her.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,479
All right.

55
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,000
Since you've made your decision,

56
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,559
you should depart soon.

57
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,759
It's unsafe out there.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
I worry Youzhou might attack tomorrow.

59
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:09,440
But Han Pu is too young.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,559
It's not safe
to bring him along with us.

61
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,479
Can you let him stay with you?

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,240
Of course.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,080
I'll have someone send him back
to Qingzhou tomorrow.

64
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,520
No. I don't want to go back.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
Pu, this is the battlefield.

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
You cannot stay here.

67
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,839
I know that.

68
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,639
Mr. Feng can protect you.

69
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,399
I can too.

70
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,360
Besides, I saw injured soldiers

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,080
on my way here.

72
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,759
Martial Sister,

73
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,279
I am a descendant of the Han family.

74
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,399
I can stay and save lives at the camp.

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,759
Either way,
I don't want to leave you again.

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,240
But...

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,960
Let him stay.

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,440
I will have Zhong Li watch over him.

79
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
All right. You can stay.

80
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,960
Take care.

81
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,440
Jiurong, take care of her.

82
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,119
I will.

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,839
You take care as well, Martial Sister.

84
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,396
(Qingzhou Encampment)

85
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,200
Are you thinking about Master Bai?

86
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,920
Yes.

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,200
If Yu Wuyuan

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,839
is indeed my master's killer,

89
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,679
what exactly is he after?

90
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,160
It might still be connected
to the Empyrean Token.

91
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,200
But...

92
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,519
The fake tokens were Dadong's schemes.

93
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,920
But Yu Wuyuan

94
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
has been plotting for Huang Chao.

95
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,640
That leaves us
to question his true motives.

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,519
I will get the Fountain Abode

97
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,119
to investigate the Empyrean Yu family

98
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,559
and the origin
of the Empyrean Token thoroughly.

99
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,040
Let's hope they find something.

100
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,799
It may offer Master Bai
some peace, at least.

101
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,000
The Lord of Youzhou
has suffered consecutive defeats,

102
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,600
and all his artilleries were destroyed.

103
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,279
Huang Chao's intention

104
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,559
must be to claim Youzhou for himself.

105
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,320
But he has yet to make his move.

106
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,600
I suspect he and Yu Wuyuan
have something else up their sleeves.

107
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,000
The Lord of Youzhou is willful.

108
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,399
After so many defeats,

109
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,279
he must be anxious and impatient.

110
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,559
However, instead of dissuading him,

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,440
Huang Chao has allowed him
to suffer one defeat after another.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Something unusual must be going on.

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,519
If something happens
to the Lord of Youzhou,

114
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,079
he will have the perfect excuse
to take over the reins

115
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,920
and combine the forces of the two states

116
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,399
and attack Qingzhou.

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,480
So he wants to deplete
Qingzhou and Youzhou's forces.

118
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,679
He must have calculated
the Lord of Youzhou's actions as well.

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,160
He knew he would go all out.

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,320
So next...

121
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,839
The Lord of Youzhou
will lead the army to war himself.

122
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:00,913
(Youzhou Encampment)

123
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,559
Your Lordship,

124
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,000
you are our lord.
Your safety is of utmost concern.

125
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,920
You shouldn't have
to enter the battlefield in person.

126
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,119
You need only give orders
in the tent and dispatch your soldiers.

127
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,559
Meng Hai.

128
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,760
I have such a mighty and powerful army.

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,200
Why do you still worry?

130
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,559
I will crush the Fengyun Cavalry
with my own hands

131
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,359
to get revenge
for the humiliation I suffered!

132
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,200
Your Highness, His Lordship insists
on entering the battlefield himself.

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,760
Please ask him to reconsider.

134
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,119
Father-in-law,

135
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,679
you will boost morale

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,679
if you lead the army yourself.

137
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:37,160
However, Qingzhou has been coming
at us fiercely over these past few days.

138
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm afraid something might happen to you

139
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,600
should you join the battle.

140
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,000
Do not worry, Huang Chao.

141
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,959
That little girl

142
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,320
is nothing to be worried about.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,519
I will lead the army to war myself

144
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,640
and show her
that we are not to be messed with.

145
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:55,519
Huang Chao, you hold the line for me.

146
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,200
Watch how I destroy the Fengyun Cavalry!

147
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,040
I wish you victory, Father-in-law.

148
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,920
I shall prepare the liquor

149
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:06,239
to celebrate your victory
when you return, Father-in-law.

150
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,480
Good.

151
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,440
Your Skyrider Cavalry
will have arrived by then.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
We will follow up with a hot pursuit!

153
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,600
If we can capture Qingzhou,

154
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,559
then Yongzhou is nothing to be feared!

155
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,559
You will surely succeed, Father-in-law.

156
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,200
So this is the Bloody Phoenix Formation.

157
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,760
The Golden Armor Cavalry
doesn't stand a chance against them.

158
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,239
They failed in a single attack.

159
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,239
It is as fast as the wind
and as swift as fire indeed.

160
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,559
The commander must be

161
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,719
one of the Four Generals of Fengyun,

162
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,200
Qi Shu.

163
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,919
Charge!

164
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,520
Shield Formation!

165
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:38,719
The outcome

166
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,080
has already been determined.

167
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,320
Well, we've learned something.

168
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,039
We've finally witnessed

169
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,599
the power of Qingzhou's
Bloody Phoenix Formation.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,719
It's time to have
the Lord of Youzhou withdraw.

171
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,479
It's over.

172
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
The Lord of Youzhou made bold claims.

173
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,640
But now, he has been utterly defeated.

174
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,479
What he needs most now

175
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,080
is a reason to retreat.

176
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,039
An excuse.

177
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,400
And this is the perfect time for us

178
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
to make such a request.

179
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,719
Father-in-law,
things aren't looking for us.

180
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:20,760
Please withdraw the troops!

181
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,960
No!

182
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,640
Kill them! Destroy them!

183
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,200
Defeat them!

184
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,320
- Charge!
- Defeat them!

185
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,479
The Golden Armor Cavalry

186
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
seems to have been exhausted.

187
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:38,840
Your Ladyship,

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
the Lord of Youzhou
is already as good as a spent force

189
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,000
when he lost his artilleries.

190
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,679
We cannot let the soldiers of Youzhou

191
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,239
make meaningless sacrifices.

192
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,479
Now that he is here,

193
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,719
I will go and greet him.

194
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,919
I'll go with you.

Thanks to Mr. Yu's
excellent medical skills,

221
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,960
my father's life has been saved.

222
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,000
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

223
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,280
His Lordship merely suffered from shock,
and his vitality was damaged.

224
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,599
With some rest, he will recover.

225
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,679
My father was too eager to win

226
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,719
and underestimated his opponents.

227
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,799
Given the current situation,

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,520
we will need to plan
and discuss matters at length.

229
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,400
I will return to my tent and wait.

230
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,280
I have something
to discuss with you, Huang Chao.

231
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,600
(You)

232
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:06,294
(You)

233
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,239
From the looks of it,

234
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
the Lord of Youzhou
will never dare to go to war again.

235
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,960
It's clear

236
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
that Feng Xiyun only meant

237
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,000
to intimidate him in this battle.

238
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,679
She didn't want his life.

239
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,919
The Lord of Youzhou brought this

240
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,679
upon himself.

241
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,880
What do you think will happen
if my Skyrider Cavalry goes up

242
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,400
against her Fengyun Cavalry?

243
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you really going to fight her
in Wuhui Valley?

244
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,960
I will have to fight her
sooner or later.

245
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,080
Of the Seven Founders,

246
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Lord Feng, Feng Duying,
was the most adept at formations.

247
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,599
Lord Tao perished

248
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,280
under her Bloody Phoenix Formation
back then.

249
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:44,960
If you are to engage her,

250
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,599
it will be a tough battle.

251
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,520
But the Lord of Youzhou is bedridden.

252
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,320
The army is without a commander.

253
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,559
In what name shall we fight?

254
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,799
Don't forget

255
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,000
that I'm the Lord of Youzhou's son-in-law.

256
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,080
What's more,

257
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,159
she is a smart lady.

258
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:19,135
(You)

259
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,119
Chunran.

260
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,599
What did you need to talk to me about?

261
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,599
My father has yet to awaken.

262
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,280
I am filled with worry,

263
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,760
but there are questions I must ask.

264
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,880
Go ahead.

265
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,679
My father advocated
the attack on Qingzhou.

266
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:44,359
He had been eager to acquire
the support of your Skyrider Cavalry.

267
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,760
But all this time,
your cavalry did not show up.

268
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,400
But now, they will be arriving soon.

269
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,640
As such, I can't help but be suspicious.

270
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,919
Have you purposely delayed them

271
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,039
and planned for them
to appear at the "right" time?

272
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,960
You misunderstood, Chunran.

273
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,880
It is a long journey from Jizhou.

274
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,640
They are getting here
as fast as they can.

275
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,919
Moreover,

276
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,479
you and I are wedded.

277
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,599
Jizhou and Youzhou are allied.

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,159
Reducing Youzhou's military forces

279
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,159
would

280
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,080
do me no good, wouldn't it?

281
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,479
You are a clever man.

282
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,880
No need for us to beat around the bush.

283
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,960
Youzhou and Jizhou
formed an alliance by marriage.

284
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,599
Naturally, our fates are tied.

285
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,679
However, my father has yet to awaken,
and Youzhou is without a leader.

286
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,719
We face internal and external conflict.

287
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,359
I want to know what you plan to do next.

288
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,200
The Lord of Youzhou
is still unconscious.

289
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,919
Youzhou is faced
with an internal struggle for the throne.

290
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,880
In my opinion,

291
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,719
you are extremely intelligent.

292
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,200
You are no less
than any of the other princes.

293
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,799
I understand what you're saying.

294
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,919
But given our current circumstances,

295
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I will need an opportunity

296
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,719
to take over the rulership of Youzhou

297
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,799
and convince the court and harem.

298
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,679
Qingzhou is threatening Youzhou,

299
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,640
and Youzhou is without a leader.

300
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,960
You'll need a new commander, of course.

301
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,719
Look at the royal family of Youzhou.

302
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,359
Who among them dares
to fight on the battlefield?

303
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,000
Seize the military forces,

304
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,119
and you will secure control of Youzhou.

305
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
As your husband,

306
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,079
I am willing to lead the army

307
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,800
and fight the war under your command.

308
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,160
You are familiar with the art of war
and well-versed in strategizing.

309
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,160
You are the perfect candidate.

310
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,640
You have thought of everything.

311
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,439
All right.

312
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,119
I will convince the court
to elect you as the commander.

313
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,560
I can give you
the Golden Armor Cavalry as well.

314
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,520
However...

315
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,719
What are your conditions?

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,040
I'm sure you know

317
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,680
what I desire.

318
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,880
If I should rule the world someday,

319
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,239
you

320
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,520
will be my empress.

321
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,040
But before you
actually conquer the world,

322
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,920
you must guarantee
Youzhou's sovereignty.

323
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,239
Is that agreeable?

324
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,319
The more time I spend with you,

325
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,839
the more I come to realize

326
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,359
how spectacular you are.

327
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,839
I hope you will continue
to be truthful with me

328
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,839
and remember your promise.

329
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I have the commander's tally
in my hands.

330
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,199
Prince Huang will go to war
on behalf of my father.

331
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,359
The Golden Armor Cavalry
shall heed his orders.

332
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,319
- Yes, Your Highness!
- Yes, Your Highness!

333
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,319
His Lordship was gravely injured

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,760
and has yet to regain consciousness.

335
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,880
Today, I shall be your commander.

336
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,640
I will fight

337
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,800
with all of you in this battle.

338
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,640
We will avenge His Lordship

339
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,160
and defeat the Fengyun Cavalry!

340
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,400
Avenge His Lordship
and defeat the Fengyun Cavalry!

341
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:14,040
Defeat the Fengyun Cavalry!

342
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
Huang Chao is commanding the army today.

343
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,640
He has led
50,000 Golden Armor Cavalry troops here.

344
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,560
He is leading the center,

345
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,359
the left and right wings,
and a five-zhang wide rearguard.

346
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,880
He is determined to fight you.

347
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,079
He has yet to mobilize
his Skyrider Cavalry.

348
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,439
Ever since we entered Youzhou,

349
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,239
the Fountain Abode
has failed to obtain any information

350
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,439
about the Skyrider Cavalry.

351
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,760
He plans to preserve the forces
of the Skyrider Cavalry.

352
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,520
He wants to use Youzhou's army

353
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,359
to wear out my Fengyun Cavalry.

354
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,239
However, the more those are his plans,

355
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,599
the more I can't let him get his way.

356
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,959
It looks like
she is waiting for something.

357
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,079
She is waiting for us to make a blunder.

358
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,359
Is that so?

359
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,520
Then, I'll show her.

360
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,119
We'll strike first to gain the advantage

361
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,760
and catch her unawares.

362
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,640
We've lost
half of the Golden Armor Cavalry.

363
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,839
Pity.

364
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,119
The Bloody Phoenix Formation
lives up to its namesake.

365
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,719
Have you found a way
to break through it?

366
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,760
It's not advisable to sacrifice soldiers
to study the formation,

367
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,520
but this is the only way.

368
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,599
The more they show us,

369
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,000
the better we will know
how to deal with them.

370
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,520
Report!

371
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,839
The Golden Armor Cavalry
has made it to the end of our formation!

372
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,319
Outflank them with the middle.
Strengthen the defense on the right wing!

373
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,160
Yes, Your Ladyship!

374
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,319
Outflank them with the middle.
Strengthen the defense on the right wing!

375
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,199
Report!

376
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
The Golden Armor Cavalry has been surrounded!
The left wing has been broken through!

377
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,319
Strengthen the two wings.
Turn the phoenix head into the middle

378
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,560
and pincer the enemy's center!

379
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,439
Yes, Your Ladyship!

380
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,199
Strengthen the two wings.
Turn the phoenix head into the middle

381
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,040
and pincer the enemy's center!

382
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,079
It's that Qi Shu again.

383
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,400
Your martial arts skills
may be better than mine,

384
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,839
but you might not win

385
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,400
on the battlefield.

386
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
The Golden Armor Cavalry
is a force to be reckoned with

387
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,319
under your command.

388
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,280
But without you,

389
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,439
they pose little threat.

390
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,680
So that was your aim.

391
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,160
In a battle, it is all about
seizing your opponent in one move.

392
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,839
If you know the outcome,

393
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,599
why continue to struggle?

394
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,319
No matter how powerful
your formation is,

395
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,839
if I order the Golden Armor Cavalry
to resist till the end,

396
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
you will pay a heavy price

397
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,479
even if you win.

398
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,719
You knew Youzhou's army
would suffer a great loss.

399
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,319
Yet, you still used their lives
to test the formation.

400
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,439
Do you wish to lose

401
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,359
the entire army?

402
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,400
Or

403
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,239
are their deaths

404
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,800
what you wanted, after all?

405
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:11,839
Huang Chao,

406
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,800
I will not give chase

407
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,520
if you withdraw now.

408
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,479
But if you insist,

409
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:20,119
I will fight to the end.

410
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,319
I admit defeat this round.

411
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,959
When I return,

412
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,880
we will settle the score.

413
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:37,870
(Qingzhou Encampment)

414
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,640
In today's battle,

415
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,560
we lost only over a hundred men

416
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,640
and defeated the Golden Armor Cavalry.

417
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,520
We took down
more than a thousand of their men.

418
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,599
Your Ladyship's stratagem
was well thought out.

419
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,319
You have my respect.

420
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,280
I am not

421
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,800
the only reason

422
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,400
we won today.

423
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,319
Do not let your guard down.

424
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,079
Huang Chao has yet to use

425
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:56,959
his ultimate weapon.

426
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,760
The Skyrider Cavalry of Jizhou
is one of the most powerful armies today.

427
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,640
The Golden Armor Cavalry
cannot hold a candle to them.

428
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,160
I expect

429
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,839
they will be here soon.

430
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,719
Report!

431
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,160
Urgent news from Yancheng,

432
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,920
Your Ladyship!

433
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,760
The Skyrider Cavalry
has torn down the gates of Yancheng.

434
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:13,959
What is the current situation?

435
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,000
The Skyrider Cavalry is heading
to Wuhui Valley.

436
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,959
As such, the citizens remain unharmed.

437
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,280
Good.

438
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,319
How far are they from Wuhui Valley?

439
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,079
How many of them are there?

440
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,400
Your Ladyship,

441
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
I was a day ahead of them.

442
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,400
We estimate they have about 100,000 men.

443
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,199
Yes, Your Ladyship.

444
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:31,719
Your Ladyship,

445
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,760
against 100,000 of them, I fear...

446
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,400
If we lose the valley,

447
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,560
Qingzhou will be done for good.

448
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,680
We must defend the valley to the end.

449
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,359
But how do we fight this battle?

450
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,479
The Moyu Cavalry

451
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,319
is all ready for battle.

452
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:55,711
The Moyu Cavalry?

453
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,079
It is a cavalry

454
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,359
that I have been secretly training.

455
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,920
It is located in Liangcheng.

456
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:04,439
Qi Shu,

457
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,319
lead a team

458
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,119
and follow Prince Feng to Liangcheng.

459
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,319
Open all the city gates

460
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,839
along the way from Liangcheng
to Wuhui Valley

461
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,839
and let the Moyu Cavalry pass.

462
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:12,719
Yes, Your Ladyship.

463
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Lin Ji. Xu Yuan.

464
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,199
Reorganize and prepare the soldiers

465
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,359
for battle at once.

466
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:17,640
Yes, Your Ladyship.

467
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,000
I will order the troops to speed up.

468
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,479
But I'm afraid they'll get here later

469
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,079
than the Skyrider Cavalry.

470
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,959
No matter what, I will be waiting.

471
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,160
No matter what,

472
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,280
promise me

473
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,119
you won't let yourself fall into danger.

474
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,400
I'll go and get ready.

475
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:40,680
Wait.

476
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,880
Take this with you.

477
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:52,837
(Deity of Romance)

478
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
I gave you this.

479
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,532
(Deity of Romance)

480
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,319
Who says?

481
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:07,359
When did you get this?

482
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,359
Before I left Liangcheng.

483
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,599
Don't you know

484
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,359
the Deity of Romance's charm
is meant to come in twos?

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,079
I guess this charm

486
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,280
really has started to protect me.

487
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:21,869
(Deity of Romance)

488
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,640
You and I

489
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,479
are tied by the red string of fate.

490
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,839
We hang on to each other.

491
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,359
We will make it through this safely.

492
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,640
Be careful.

493
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:03,280
(Deity of Romance)

494
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,000
Sir.

495
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,959
The Skyrider Cavalry has arrived.

496
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:16,400
I'm afraid this battle is...

497
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,040
There is no question about it.

498
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,520
We're only halfway through this game.

499
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,280
It's too early to decide a victor.

500
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,000
All of them are merely the pieces,

501
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,400
and I am the chess player.

502
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Deliver these letters.

503
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,920
(To General Zeng Pu of Shang, Bei...)

504
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:31,920
Understood.

505
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,615
(On the main battlefield,)

506
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:42,000
(the Golden Armor Cavalry
will go up against the Fengyun Cavalry.)

507
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
(Meanwhile, the Skyrider Cavalry
will seize Yancheng from behind)

508
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,560
(so that Qingzhou will be caught
between two fires.)

509
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,920
(How will Qingzhou respond?)

510
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,400
(Things have been going
a little too well.)

511
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,719
(And Qingzhou's Bloody Phoenix Formation)

512
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,640
(is proving to be a serious challenge.)

513
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,760
This is an analysis I made
based on the previous battle.

514
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,280
I think we will be able

515
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,239
to break the Bloody Phoenix Formation
for sure this time.

516
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,160
You've been of great help
to me again, Wuyuan.

517
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,400
With this,

518
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,280
we will stand a chance
to break the Bloody Phoenix Formation.

519
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,640
But,

520
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,599
I have another concern.

521
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,079
What is it?

522
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,160
From what I know about Feng Lanxi,

523
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,479
he must have other plans in store.

524
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,680
Feng Lanxi may have been named the Heir,

525
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,000
but the Lord of Yongzhou did not
grant him access to military forces.

526
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,880
He can do nothing on the battlefield

527
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,079
without an army.

528
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,040
I believe you overthink,

529
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,599
Your Highness.

530
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:52,079
I hope you prove me right.

531
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:55,880
Your Ladyship,

532
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,119
arrangements have been made
for the provisioning of the army

533
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,119
for the next few days.

534
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,000
Got it.

535
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:08,920
Go on.

536
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:09,800
Your Ladyship,

537
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,599
we are outnumbered in this battle.

538
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,920
We are worried about your safety.

539
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,199
I hope you will prioritize
the greater good for Qingzhou

540
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,479
and allow us to defend the frontlines

541
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,239
while Your Ladyship falls back

542
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,239
and protect Qingzhou at the rear.

543
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,160
We have prepared our frontline forces,

544
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,479
and we will have
the support of the Moyu Cavalry.

545
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,680
Yet, all of you harbor many concerns.

546
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,439
Do you think that I am unfit

547
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,640
to fight on the battlefield?

548
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,439
Not at all.

549
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,479
Your Ladyship, you're fearless and powerful.

550
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,479
So you are worried
about the reinforcements then.

551
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,400
We are somewhat aware

552
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,719
of your relationship with Prince Feng.

553
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,560
But...

554
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:42,479
He is still the heir
of the Lord of Yongzhou,

555
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,359
and you are the ruler of Qingzhou.

556
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,880
The battlefield is unpredictable.

557
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,119
We don't even know

558
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,000
when he will return with his forces.

559
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,079
To be safe,

560
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,520
we ask that Your Ladyship
retreat to the rear.

561
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,479
Lin Ji.

562
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,239
There is nowhere to retreat to

563
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,880
in this war.

564
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,800
Do you think I would allow myself

565
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,680
to stay safe
and be protected in the back

566
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,280
while all of you
fight to the death at the front?

567
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,640
The circumstances
of this battle are different.

568
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,239
The disparity of forces between our foes
and ours is far too wide.

569
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,719
We simply cannot...

570
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:08,640
I trust him.

571
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,760
In all the time that I have known him,

572
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,119
he has never let me down.

573
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,880
I understand.

574
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,199
But

575
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,520
Prince Feng represents Yongzhou.

576
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,400
Yongzhou has always taken a firm stance.

577
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,839
Your Ladyship, have you ever considered

578
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,880
how would we deal with the consequences

579
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:27,119
should they decide to use this matter

580
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,760
to suppress Qingzhou and cause conflict

581
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,839
between the two states?

582
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,000
If the world can be unified

583
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,680
and the people may live in peace,

584
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,119
why would we have to worry

585
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,280
about such conflicts?

586
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,680
Your Ladyship, you mean...

587
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,439
Qingzhou has never had the ambitions
to conquer the world.

588
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,839
We only wish to protect
the peaceful lives of our people.

589
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,400
Right now, the world is in strife.

590
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,119
The people are suffering.

591
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:02,520
If a wise ruler should appear,

592
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,760
Qingzhou will cease to fight

593
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,319
and submit to him.

594
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:07,839
Why are you certain

595
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,719
that Prince Feng will be the one
to achieve that, Your Ladyship?

596
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,199
You need a hero to conquer the world,

597
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,119
but you need

598
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,479
a wise and benevolent leader
to rule it.

599
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,199
But Your Ladyship will be
a wise and benevolent ruler as well.

600
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Why should you bow down to others?

601
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,599
Why won't you become the empress

602
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,040
and rule the world yourself?

603
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,640
That sounds good, of course.

604
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,239
However, we all
have our own aspirations.

605
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,479
Lin Ji,

606
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
what kind of person do you want to be?

607
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,079
I want to be a good and loyal
subject and general to Your Ladyship.

608
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,560
Do you know

609
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,040
what kind of person I want to be then?

610
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,400
I...

611
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,199
It is late.

612
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:46,880
Go back and rest.

613
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,599
Your Ladyship, no matter what happens,

614
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,880
the entire Fengyun Cavalry

615
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,000
will serve you forever.

616
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,479
You're our only ruler.

617
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:54,839
I understand.

618
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,800
When you go back,

619
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,040
tell them

620
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
every word I said.

621
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,280
So you knew.

622
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,319
We've known each other
for so many years.

623
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,839
How could I not know
what all of you are thinking?

624
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,439
I know

625
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,760
all of you are loyal to me.

626
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:13,760
You've always had reservations

627
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,680
about our alliance with Yongzhou,

628
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,280
but none of you dared to ask questions

629
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,479
for fear of offending me.

630
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,400
But you guys are not blind followers.

631
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,959
I think

632
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:22,959
you must have lost to Xu Yuan
in a finger-guessing game again.

633
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:23,680
I...

634
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,640
I've never won against him.

635
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:31,920
Go back.

636
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,520
Wuyuan!

637
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,839
Why are you here, Your Highness?

638
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:06,119
I came with General Xiao and the others.

639
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,080
But this is a battlefield.

640
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,639
Your life could be at risk at any time.

641
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,760
Are you worried about me?

642
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,679
Mr. Yu.

643
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,239
General Xuekong.

644
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,800
Wuyuan,
the Skyrider Cavalry has arrived.

645
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
I intend to go to battle tomorrow.

646
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
What are the odds of winning?

647
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,320
With the method you provided,

648
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,360
sixty percent.

649
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,760
Also,

650
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,600
I need a favor.

651
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,719
Do tell.

652
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,080
Huang Yu.

653
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,239
Yes.

654
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,239
I command you to protect Wuyuan.

655
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,199
Yes!

656
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,080
You know I can't actually

657
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,399
let her enter the battlefield.

658
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,760
Keep her safe.

659
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,800
Understood.

660
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,239
Xuekong.

661
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,679
Yes, Your Highness.

662
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,320
Let's go.

663
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,320
Huang Chao ordered me to protect you.

664
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,000
We'll be inseparable from now on.

665
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,719
I shall trouble you then, Your Highness.

666
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,919
Jiushuang.

667
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,040
You take the left.

668
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,199
Xuekong.

669
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,320
You take the center.

670
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,199
Yes, Your Highness.

671
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,560
Let's see if we can break

672
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,840
the Bloody Phoenix Formation today.

673
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,679
Your Ladyship,

674
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,399
they have seen through our formation.

675
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,000
What's the status?

676
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,560
They lost more than 10,000 men.

677
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,560
But we've lost even more.

678
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:58,919
We have less than 30,000 soldiers left.

679
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,600
They must have found a way
to break the formation.

680
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,159
Given our current numbers,

681
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,000
we cannot maintain
the formation any further.

682
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,439
Any news about the Moyu Cavalry?
How far away are they?

683
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,080
The scouts

684
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,560
did not manage to learn anything.

685
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,679
I fear they won't be here any time soon.

686
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,000
Your Ladyship,

687
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,959
I implore you to withdraw first.

688
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,080
If we lose Wuhui Valley,

689
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,239
we will lose all defenses.

690
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,959
Qingzhou will be defenseless.

691
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,120
We cannot fall back.

692
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,120
We must hold on
until the reinforcements arrive.

693
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,560
Men!

694
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,560
Defeat the enemy with me!

695
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,199
Feng Xiyun has joined the battle.

696
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
The outcome has been decided.
