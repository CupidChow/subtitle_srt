19
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,040
=Episode 1=

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,760
(In a world divided
into seven factions,)

21
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,360
(the Imperial Family)

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,279
(rules the Six States
with the Empyrean Token.)

23
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,680
(Within the martial world)

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,360
(lies the two strongest individuals,)

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,319
(the Head of Fountain Abode,)

26
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,440
(Hei Fengxi,)

27
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,959
(and a heroine from Tianshuang Sect,)

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,000
(Bai Fengxi,)

29
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,080
(both of whom are stuck
in a perpetual fight for superiority.)

30
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,199
(Interestingly,)

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,199
(as indifferent to others
as Hei Fengxi is,)

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
(he will always attend)

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,919
(every challenge Bai Fengxi issues.)

34
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,039
(Thus, many jest)

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,080
(that wherever Bai Fengxi is,)

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,000
(Hei Fengxi will surely be there too.)

37
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,759
(Now, their story begins
in the Dadong Empire.)

38
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,880
(Dadong)

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
(Dadong)

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
(Crown Prince of Dadong, Jing Yan)

41
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,559
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince
requests an audience with you.

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,000
Bring him in.

43
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:56,360
(Dadong)
The Crown Prince, Jing Yan,

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,107
(Dadong)
will now meet with His Majesty!

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,480
(Emperor Chunxi of Dadong)

46
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,960
Greetings, Father.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,520
I wish you a life
of longevity and prosperity.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,559
I was told

49
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,399
that the Empyrean Token went missing.

50
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,039
Are you panicking?

51
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,160
I...

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,360
Remember.

53
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,520
You are my son,

54
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,479
the future Emperor of Dadong.

55
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,199
Nothing in this world can faze you.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,279
So

57
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,360
what should we do next, sir?

58
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,960
The loss of the Empyrean Token

59
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,520
will provoke different reactions
from the Six States.

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,960
Your Majesty,

61
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,600
let's sit tight and assess.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,520
Just proceed with the plan.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,680
(Dadong)

64
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,880
Emperor Chunxi of Dadong

65
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,279
has issued a decree
to the lords of all Six States.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,720
Find the Empyrean Token.

67
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:31,437
(Fountain Abode)

68
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,760
It's okay, Cangyi.

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,519
Take your time.

70
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:47,585
(Hei Fengxi's Servant, Zhong Li)

71
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,000
Sir.

72
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,119
Heavy rainfall this year

73
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,600
has inevitably affected
the taste of the fountain water.

74
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,920
Sir, Cangyi came back with a message

75
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,760
that the Imperial Family lost
the Empyrean Token.

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,600
Emperor Chunxi has issued a imperial decree

77
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,359
and tasked every State
with its retrieval.

78
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,880
The Imperial Family's power
is on the decline.

79
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,079
The Six States are coveting the throne.

80
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,079
And now, the Empyrean Token
went missing.

81
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,079
There must be some machinations.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Zhong Li.

83
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,320
Ask everyone here

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,040
to collect more info
about the Imperial Family

85
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,119
and get to the bottom of this.

86
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,160
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,518
(Head of Fountain Abode, Hei Fengxi)

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,033
(Six States shall retrieve Empyrean Token)

89
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,112
(and return it to the Imperial Family.)

90
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,359
After the establishment
of Dadong Empire,

91
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,839
(Lord of Qingzhou)
to keep the power in check,

92
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,040
(Lord of Beizhou)
the founding father, Emperor Weilie,

93
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:50,600
(Lord of Beizhou)
forged the Empyrean Token.

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
(Lord of Shangzhou)
forged the Empyrean Token.

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,759
(Lord of Shangzhou)
It is the symbol of sovereignty.

96
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,839
It is the symbol of sovereignty.

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,490
(Lord of Jizhou)
Whoever possesses it

98
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,760
(Lord of Youzhou)
will be the rightful ruler of the world.

99
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,760
Empyrean Token carries the world.

100
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,519
Get the Token

101
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,000
and the world will be yours.

102
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,399
Make an announcement.

103
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,360
(Lord of Yongzhou)

104
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,799
Let everyone

105
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,040
in Yongzhou search for this token.

106
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,229
(One Month Later)

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,573
(Mount Xuan)

108
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:35,960
(General Liefeng of Jizhou,
Yan Yingzhou)

109
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,560
(Dadong Empire Map)

110
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,239
Your Highness,

111
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,839
(Jizhou's General, Xiao Xuekong)
Yan Yingzhou has found the Empyrean Token.

112
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,691
(The Heir of Lord of Jizhou, Huang Chao)
Good.

113
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,040
Where is he now?

114
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:48,399
He's currently in Beizhou.

115
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,600
The other States
have sent their respective envoys.

116
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,320
Dispatch our people
to get Yingzhou to safety.

117
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:54,920
Yes, Your Highness.

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,799
If the Empyrean Token
belongs to Jizhou,

119
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,079
it'll be a matter of time

120
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,040
before the entire world follows suit.

121
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,479
I haven't seen
these many dimwits in a while.

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,880
How fun.

123
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:04,320
(Disciple of Tianshuang Sect, Bai Fengxi)
Lin Yin'an of Youzhou,

124
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,599
why are you intervening now?

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,919
Were you trembling in your boots

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,119
when you saw Yan Yingzhou's long blade?

127
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,320
You're asking for my blade.

128
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,440
Come down now!

129
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,280
I dislike your manner of speech.

130
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,119
You're the Heroine Fengxi?

131
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,919
Do you know me?

132
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,400
Bai Fengxi, as beautiful
as she is lethal. Everyone knows that.

133
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,880
Are you interested
in the Empyrean Token too, Miss Feng?

134
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,960
I couldn't care less about the token.

135
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,719
However, I quite like

136
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,239
this Yan Yingzhou.

137
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,520
You are strong, Miss,

138
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,880
but you are outnumbered.

139
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,119
Why should you meddle in this business?

140
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
If you can compensate for my loss,

141
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,760
I'll leave right away.

142
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,200
Name your price.

143
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,280
I was having a nap

144
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,719
and you interrupted my sweet dream.

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,640
Do you know who I dreamt of?

146
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,119
Queen Mother of the West. She invited me
to the Divine Mountain, Kunlun

147
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:03,200
to wine and to admire fairy dances
with her.

148
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
Oh, the bliss!

149
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,200
She even gave me a Divine Peach.

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,239
Just when I was about to take it
from her hands,

151
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,719
all of you barged in.

152
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,320
If you can

153
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,599
give me this Divine Peach,

154
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
I'll leave right away.

155
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,239
I don't want Yan Yingzhou

156
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,359
or the Empyrean Token.

157
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
He, this woman is just taking us
for fools.

158
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,239
Chase her!

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,640
Catch me if you can.

160
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:37,290
(Pure and Elegant)

161
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,880
Sir, I just received news

162
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,679
that General Liefeng of Jizhou,
Yan Yingzhou,

163
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,520
got the Empyrean Token.

164
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,239
All other States
are hunting him right now.

165
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,359
Jizhou

166
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,880
sure is doing everything
to get the token.

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,479
Sir, now is good timing.

168
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,840
Are we not going in to interfere?

169
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,000
You see the full picture

170
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,760
but you fail to understand humans.

171
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,559
Humans?

172
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,080
All Six States have their own agenda.

173
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Whoever gets the Empyrean Token first

174
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,679
will get a head start

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,159
but they will have to face

176
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,119
the siege from the rest.

177
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,200
It's unfortunate for General Liefeng

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,599
that he has to deal with it now.

179
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,440
Sir,

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,799
another update.

181
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,520
Bai Fengxi of Tianshuang Sect
rescued Yan Yingzhou.

182
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,520
Is your rival, Miss Feng,

183
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,359
after the token as well?

184
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,200
Let Cangyi follow them closely.

185
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,479
Noted.

186
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,520
(Is she here too?)

187
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
(It must be just an act of heroism.)

188
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,919
(Well, she has always been like that.)

189
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,200
Thank you for your intervention,
Heroine Feng.

190
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,799
May I know why you saved me?

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,239
Three years ago.

192
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,000
In Changfeng City.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,919
In Changfeng City?

194
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,039
That day,

195
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,799
Jizhou and Shangzhou waged a war.

196
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,479
To protect the commoners,

197
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,840
you and your army

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,919
held the Shangzhou army

199
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,359
in the Liefeng Pass,
north of Changfeng City.

200
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,080
You won the war

201
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
but you also disrupted
the military pacing

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,039
and were duly punished
by the Lord of Jizhou.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,280
War is among soldiers.

204
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,880
The commoners are innocent.

205
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,719
And that

206
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,440
is why I saved you.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,719
You care about the people
and your nation.

208
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,599
You shouldn't die to thugs.

209
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,919
What I did today

210
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,280
was just fulfilling
all commoners' wishes.

211
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,239
You have a sense of justice,
Heroine Feng.

212
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,760
Heroine Feng,

213
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,239
I have another favor to ask.

214
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,679
To deliver the Empyrean Token to Jizhou?

215
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,359
Sorry, I can't help it.

216
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,479
I'm used to lounging around.

217
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,599
Do it yourself.

218
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,359
I might not survive for long.

219
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,400
You met me.

220
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,679
You still stand a chance to live.

221
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,039
Do you know the Han family?

222
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,239
Do you want to get some medicines
from them?

223
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,440
You catch up quickly.

224
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,119
I am a close friend
of their family's head.

225
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,359
I will get Zifu Powder and Buddha Pill
from him.

226
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,799
You'll be fine.

227
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,760
Take this first.

228
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
You will live for another day.

229
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,880
I will bring

230
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,080
medicines to you within a day.

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,930
(Pure and Elegant)

232
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:42,029
(Pure and Elegant)

233
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Sir, Cangyi fetched another message.

234
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,599
Miss Feng is now heading
to the Han's Residence.

235
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,479
No trace of Yan Yingzhou.

236
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,200
She is trying to get some medicines
for him.

237
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,640
Find her and we'll find Yan Yingzhou,

238
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,400
and the token too, of course.

239
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,559
Many are

240
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,280
looking for her now.

241
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,960
Didn't Han Xuanling
send us an invitation?

242
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,280
Yes.

243
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,479
Good.

244
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Let's pay him a visit.

245
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,215
(The Hans)

246
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,523
(Han's Residence)

247
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:22,874
(Birthday)

248
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,518
(Han's Young Master, Han Pu,
Han's Family Head, Han Xuanling)

249
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,359
Mr. Han!

250
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
May you live long and prosper!

251
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:33,799
Thank you.

252
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,359
My beloved guests.

253
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
Today is my birthday.

254
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,599
I thank you all for coming
to share this joy with me.

255
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,039
A toast to everyone!

256
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,159
How festive.

257
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,520
You again?

258
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,679
Better late than never.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,119
I too would like to wish you, Mr. Han,

260
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,080
a long and prosperous life.

261
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,400
Bai Fengxi.

262
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,479
If you stopped dropping by here,

263
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,760
I definitely would live longer.

264
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,000
You have snatched medicines from me
many times.

265
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,919
Today is my day

266
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,200
and I will let you slide just this once.

267
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,320
Please leave at once.

268
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,719
Otherwise, pardon my aggression.

269
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,119
You set the rule

270
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,080
that whoever wants medicines from you

271
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,200
needs to pay a thousand pieces of gold.

272
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,840
You practically forced me to steal.

273
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,479
But don't you worry.

274
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,440
All your medicines did not go to waste.

275
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,679
They saved countless lives.

276
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,760
You should thank me, you know.

277
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,760
Enough of your twists and turns.

278
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,479
Never have I seen anyone
as shameless as you.

279
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,479
This is a warning.

280
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,599
Leave now

281
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,239
and never come back again!

282
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,840
I have an emergency too

283
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,359
so I won't stay
for your birthday dinner.

284
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,119
One pack of Zifu Powder
and one Buddha Pill.

285
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,239
I'll leave once I get them.

286
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:47,960
Someone!

287
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,119
Get her out of my sight!

288
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,200
What a fine brew!

289
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,159
You did not skimp for your
60th birthday.

290
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,119
You...

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Enjoy the feast while you can, everyone.

292
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,119
Mr. Han

293
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,280
is celebrating his 60th birthday today.

294
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,239
God knows if there will be his 61st.

295
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,359
Why do you wish ill-luck upon my father?

296
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:23,760
Young child,

297
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,440
knowing how stingy your father is,

298
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,679
we truly don't know if he will spend
as much for his next birthday.

299
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:29,840
Han Pu.

300
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,200
Back off.

301
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,840
Housekeeper, take him away!

302
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,640
Hurry up.

303
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,320
Bai Fengxi.

304
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,359
In terms of martial arts,

305
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,679
I am far inferior to you.

306
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,239
That's why you snatched many medicines
from me.

307
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,479
But

308
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,760
if you want
to attempt the same thing today,

309
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,440
I will not surrender easily.

310
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,640
Mr. Han,

311
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,599
today is your birthday.

312
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,599
Just stay aside

313
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,200
and let me teach her a lesson
on your behalf.

314
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,839
I will need

315
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,560
any help I can get.

316
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,199
You stole my pig trotter!

317
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,239
Too slow.

318
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,199
Try harder.

319
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:22,438
(Han's Residence)

320
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,959
Sir, there's a brawl inside.

321
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,199
As usual.

322
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,239
Choking?

323
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,479
Does it hurt?

324
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,719
Let me help you.

325
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,800
Zhong Li, announce our presence.

326
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,760
Noted.

327
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,000
Can we talk now?

328
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,560
Wait.

329
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,706
(Birthday)

330
00:17:58,719 --> 00:17:59,439
Mr. Han.

331
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,680
My Young Master came bearing
good wishes.

332
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,400
Who is your Young Master?

333
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,239
Hei Fengxi of Fountain Abode.

334
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,119
(Hei Fengxi?)

335
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,479
(Why is he here?)

336
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,959
Oh, Mr. Fengxi.

337
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,760
Show him in.

338
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,160
Did you invite Hei Fengxi?

339
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,560
Do you truly think you're the strongest
in the world now?

340
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,479
Don't you know

341
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,839
some guests are best uninvited?

342
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I just know

343
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,479
an uninvited guest like you
is a pain in the neck.

344
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,680
You can't distinguish friends from foes.

345
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,479
How did you survive thus far?

346
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,479
Black Foxy!

347
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,239
Come out now!

348
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,439
Or else, I'll skin you!

349
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,839
You have never changed a bit.

350
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,520
As uncouth as ever.

351
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,800
Sir.

352
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,079
The time it takes
for you to settle in comfortably

353
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,199
is enough for me
to take a nap already.

354
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,719
You have not improved at all.

355
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,359
I ought to, truth be told.

356
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,439
I hate to be in the same league as you.

357
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
It's the greatest misfortune ever.

358
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,719
May I remind you

359
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,599
that you should mind your posture now?

360
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,239
Otherwise,
"as beautiful as she is lethal"

361
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,560
will sound like a joke.

362
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,000
Greetings, Mr. Fengxi.

363
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,160
Pardon

364
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,839
this sorry state of affairs.

365
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,359
Greetings, Mr. Han.

366
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:42,000
You traveled far to my abode,
Mr. Fengxi.

367
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,959
I owe you a proper welcome

368
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:44,920
but

369
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,160
unfortunately,
I'm in a pickle at the moment.

370
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,959
May I ask for your assistance?

371
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,479
You want me to teach Bai Fengxi

372
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,479
a lesson?

373
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,680
And

374
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,680
please make her

375
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,839
pay me back the medicines

376
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,079
she stole from me.

377
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,000
Mr. Han.

378
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,719
I have used all your medicines

379
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,599
and I have no money with me.

380
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,199
What to do then,

381
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,560
Mr. Han?

382
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,640
It's simple.

383
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,680
Apologize to me in person

384
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:15,239
and leave her thieving hands here.

385
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:17,640
I'll forgo our past grievances.

386
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,079
Take them away then.

387
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
This accursed life!

388
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,040
Why do I have to know
a troublemaker like you?

389
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,199
Mr. Han,

390
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,640
how about I apologize to you
on her behalf?

391
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,199
I can't possibly accept it.

392
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,680
She stole your medicines

393
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,319
to help others.

394
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
It's not for personal gain.

395
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,400
Consider her gesture as accumulating
good merits for your family.

396
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,079
Please muster your generosity

397
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,800
and forgive her youthful misbehavior.

398
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,640
As for the stolen medicines...

399
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,000
Give me a price, Mr. Han.

400
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I'll settle the payment.

401
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:10,920
I...

402
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,760
While her boisterous act might have
offended many heroes here,

403
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,479
it is but her playful nature.

404
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,319
Do take it as a harmless joke

405
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,119
and I pray
that you will be generous enough

406
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,160
to not hold her accountable.

407
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,920
Again, I apologize to all of you

408
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,439
on her behalf.

409
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,719
(He is known to be cunning.)

410
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,319
(What is he plotting today?)

411
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,160
You're too courteous, Mr. Fengxi.

412
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,760
We will not hold any grudge
against Heroine Feng, of course.

413
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,400
Now that the dust has settled,

414
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,599
to celebrate

415
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,359
Mr. Han's birthday,

416
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,040
I have brought 100 pots of fine wine.

417
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,760
Would all of you love to have a sip?

418
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,239
Thank you, Mr. Fengxi.

419
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,959
Please wait in the adjacent yard.

420
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,599
(Whatever. I'll get the medicine first.)

421
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,280
Thank you.

422
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,560
Mr. Han.

423
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,119
The thing inside
is worth 100,000 pieces of gold.

424
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,479
It's more than enough to pay

425
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,599
for the medicines I stole.

426
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,599
Can you give me

427
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,760
one more pack of Zifu Powder
and Buddha Pill?

428
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,439
This is the payment
for the medicines she stole.

429
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,839
Please accept it, Mr. Han.

430
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Can you give her what she asked for?

431
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,160
Sure.

432
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,719
Of course.

433
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:55,680
I shall retrieve the medicines now.

434
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,280
All right.

435
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:08,520
Oh, lord.

436
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,079
Bai Fengxi, stand right there!

437
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,640
Stay there!

438
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,959
My medicines will be all gone now.

439
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,880
Stay right there, Bai Fengxi!

440
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,400
Bai Fengxi.

441
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
Give me the Empyrean Token.

442
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,959
I don't have it.

443
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,439
Leave now.

444
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,680
Don't make me angry.

445
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:38,640
Nonsense.

446
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,079
You rescued Yan Yingzhou.

447
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
If you don't have it,

448
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,239
then tell me where he is now.

449
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,599
Don't force our hands.

450
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,439
I, Bai Fengxi,

451
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,400
is not averse to blood.

452
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,640
Yan Yingzhou!

453
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,880
Idiot!

454
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,000
Come.

455
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,319
Come.

456
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,000
Zhong Li.

457
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,280
Why did our Young Master
treat these people to wine?

458
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,079
It's because

459
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,719
he doesn't want them to go to Mount Xuan

460
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,160
(Hei Fengxi's Servant, Ren Chuanyu)
to cause more trouble for Miss Feng.

461
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,239
So what is the relationship
between them?

462
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,560
You are always with him.

463
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,400
Tell me.

464
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,079
I saw Miss Feng several times

465
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,439
when I was with our Young Master.

466
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,920
But every time they saw each other,

467
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,079
they fought.

468
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,400
Why?

469
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,359
To see who's the best.

470
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,599
To find out whether Hei Fengxi

471
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,959
or Bai Fengxi will rule
the martial world.

472
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,839
I truly have not met

473
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,680
a woman like Miss Feng before.

474
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,119
She refuses to conform.

475
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,959
Don't you think so?

476
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,119
I do. Yes, she is being uncivilized.

477
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,439
But somehow, I feel

478
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,719
that she's meant to behave that way.

479
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,719
I even envy her a bit.

480
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,719
Maybe

481
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,599
Young Master is into Miss Feng.

482
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:01,599
Right?

483
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,239
I think so too.

484
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:03,959
Yes.

485
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,599
You see, Young Master is...

486
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:07,760
Sir.

487
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,920
Who do I like?

488
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,400
Everyone inside is drunk.

489
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,760
We should leave now.

490
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,959
Any update on Mount Xuan?

491
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,920
After Miss Feng returned,

492
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,040
Yan Yingzhou is nowhere to be found.

493
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,359
Everyone

494
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,560
is looking for him in Mount Xuan now.

495
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,599
(I think he just doesn't want
to burden Bai Fengxi.)

496
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,479
(Given her nature,)

497
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,000
(that will just make her more committed
to this affair.)

498
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,239
(It seems like)

499
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,560
(a tough battle awaits tonight.)

500
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,599
Yan Yingzhou.

501
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,160
Heroine Feng.

502
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,719
These are the Buddha Pills.

503
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,920
This is Zifu Powder,
for external wounds.

504
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,800
Please take it.

505
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,520
Thank you, Heroine Feng.

506
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,439
Why did you leave on your own?

507
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,839
I rescued you.

508
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,239
You are not a burden to me.

509
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:16,920
Come. This way.

510
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,599
Let's go.

511
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:41,439
Yan Yingzhou.

512
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,479
Hand over the Empyrean Token
and you will be spared.

513
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,479
Bai Fengxi,

514
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,760
do you think both of you

515
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,920
can flee this mountain?

516
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,680
Do you want to fight together

517
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,040
and clear a path for us?

518
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,719
I'm glad you asked.

519
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,599
With a chance to fight together
with Heroine Feng,

520
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,839
I have no regret in my life.

521
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,839
Go!

522
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,119
Empyrean Token!

523
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,000
Empyrean Token!

524
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,119
The token is poisonous.

525
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,119
They escaped again.

526
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,400
At this point, you should leave first.

527
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,079
Eat these.

528
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,400
You...

529
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Two Buddha Pills

530
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,599
will be enough to counter the toxin
in my system.

531
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,439
I saved them just in case.

532
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,160
These four Buddha Pills

533
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:44,959
are not the antidotes to the poison,

534
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,920
but they can prolong your life
for the moment.

535
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,520
Given what you're capable of,

536
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,040
you just need to go to the Hans
and ask for more Buddha Pills

537
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,119
to save yourself.

538
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,079
They are here.

539
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,160
I will lure them away.

540
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,959
Just find an opening to sneak out.

541
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,800
I know I shouldn't burden you
with any more tasks

542
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,400
but please deliver this blade

543
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,079
to Prince Huang Chao.

544
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,560
I will repay your kindness

545
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,959
in my next life.

546
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,400
I, Yan Yingzhou, am here.
Who's here for a duel?

547
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:47,719
Sir.

548
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,079
Miss Feng is safe

549
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,719
but Yan Yingzhou lost his life.

550
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,599
Who would know that Yan Yingzhou
would meet his end

551
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,800
in Mount Xuan?

552
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,040
(They couldn't find the Empyrean Token)

553
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,280
(so they would go after her now.)

554
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,880
Deliver this message.

555
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,439
Let Sun Si arrange accordingly.

556
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Noted, sir.

557
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,239
Yan Yingzhou is dead

558
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,640
but the Empyrean Token is still missing.

559
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,800
Bai Fengxi has it then.

560
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,199
Who are you?

561
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:19,160
(Servant of Fountain Abode, Sun Si)

562
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,959
(Servant of Fountain Abode, Sun Si)
Sun Si of Fountain Abode.

563
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,239
Why are you in our way?

564
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,880
My Young Master said

565
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,599
that Mount Xuan is a dangerous place.

566
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,119
Why don't all of you turn around

567
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,359
and have a moment's rest
by the foot of the mountain?

568
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:30,839
Why should we do that?

569
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,199
My Young Master is not trying
to coerce everyone into leaving.

570
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,160
Do note that

571
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,520
my Young Master set up

572
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,479
many traps in this mountain.

573
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,640
Hike the mountain

574
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,319
at your own discretion.

575
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,160
I heard in the Han's Residence,

576
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,560
Hei Fengxi helped Bai Fengxi.

577
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:46,239
I'm sure

578
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,119
both of them are working together.

579
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,400
Those are my Young Master's words.

580
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,520
Whether you choose

581
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,359
to believe them or not, it's up to you.

582
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm just the messenger

583
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,400
to deliver a warning.

584
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,800
Fountain Abode has intervened.

585
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,520
I don't know what its Head is plotting.

586
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,119
It's dark and the path
is littered with traps.

587
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,000
I quit.

588
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,040
Let's go.

589
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,839
All right.

590
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,479
I don't believe that Hei Fengxi at all.

591
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,199
Let's go.

592
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,800
Yan Yingzhou.

593
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,000
Yan Yingzhou.

594
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,640
Where are you?

595
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,719
Yan Yingzhou.

596
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:44,680
Where are you?

597
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:45,880
Yan Yingzhou.

598
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,920
You're late.

599
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,119
He's already dead.

600
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,119
Dead?

601
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,400
Who are you?

602
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,079
You don't need to know.

603
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
Hand over the Empyrean Token

604
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
and it will be a quick death.

605
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,160
No way.

606
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,479
Sir.

607
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,719
The Soultaker Sect arrived at Mount Xuan.

608
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,679
They surrounded Miss Feng.

609
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,080
Those vermin

610
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
came as well.

611
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,199
Should we...

612
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:30,600
♪Like the dissipating fog,
you become clearer♪

613
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:38,560
♪Like the hawk that soars freely,
you reject the shackles♪

614
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:46,840
♪Your white silk is as light
as a feather and yet it moves my heart♪

615
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,559
♪Ripples come at me♪

616
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:55,480
♪But I don't want to dodge♪

617
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,280
♪Wind is just the outline of the cloud♪

618
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,199
You're safe now.

619
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:03,000
♪Black is the lock of the White♪

620
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:07,440
♪Night is when the Day sleeps♪

621
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,700
♪You are a part of me♪

622
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,081
♪With a merry start, don't worry
about a sorrowful end♪

623
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,040
Is this the Empyrean Token?

624
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,120
This token

625
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,600
is a counterfeit.

626
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,320
Northsea Iron shines blue under light.

627
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,719
This token does not carry
such characteristic.

628
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,800
So Yan Yingzhou is just a decoy?

629
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,040
Huang Chao already has the token?

630
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,080
Yan Yingzhou

631
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,399
is the leader
of the Four Jizhou Generals.

632
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,560
The Heir of the Lord of Jizhou, Huang Chao,
appreciates good talents.

633
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,320
He won't sacrifice Yan Yingzhou
like this.

634
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,520
So this token is a fake one
from the get-go?

635
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,280
Everyone fought after
a fake Empyrean Token?

636
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,159
Circulate this fake Empyrean Token

637
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,879
and make all heroes lose their lives for it.

638
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,639
The mastermind will reap the benefit.

639
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,360
What a huge web he cast.

640
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,959
Now that we know the token
is a counterfeit,

641
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,959
should we head back, sir?

642
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,239
Wait.

643
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
Check if she is okay

644
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,560
before we return.

645
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:56,959
Zhong Li.

646
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:58,600
Build two huts

647
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,840
next to the cavern.

648
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:00,959
Noted.

649
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

650
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,760
Status report?

651
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,840
General Yan lost his life in Mount Xuan.

652
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:21,719
Has Yingzhou died?

653
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,639
Yes.

654
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,199
A bloody battle broke out in Mount Xuan.

655
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,159
We were too late.

656
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,600
General Yan was outnumbered

657
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,000
and lost his life.

658
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,159
Rumor has it that Bai Fengxi
has the Empyrean Token now.

659
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,600
Bai Fengxi with the plain white attire.

660
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,959
She has the Empyrean Token.

661
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,800
Any news about her?

662
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:40,959
Nothing so far.

663
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,000
Your Highness, I will send someone
to look for her now.

664
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,479
Since

665
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,600
Yingzhou is dead,

666
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,080
let's return...

667
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,639
We have to head to Mount Xuan.

668
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:58,600
Let's bring Yingzhou

669
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,560
home.

670
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,360
Noted.

671
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,520
You're awake.

672
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:23,639
I didn't know

673
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,399
you would get poisoned as well.

674
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,479
The token is poisonous.

675
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,719
If you had notified me,

676
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,000
I could have saved Yan Yingzhou.

677
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,120
If I had notified you earlier,

678
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,760
you would have arrived earlier

679
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:39,080
and had the token.

680
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,439
Sorry

681
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,040
to have left you out
of this excellent opportunity.

682
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,320
Our misunderstanding runs deep.

683
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,280
You couldn't find Yan Yingzhou
in Mount Xuan

684
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,040
so you thought I had the token.

685
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,399
That's why you visited
the Han's Residence, didn't you?

686
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,760
You got me out of the pickle,
supposedly,

687
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,040
but you didn't expect
that I didn't have the token with me.

688
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,320
Therefore, you followed me

689
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,840
and waited for its reappearance.

690
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,239
But I didn't take the token, did I?

691
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,239
No, you didn't.

692
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,560
You know the token
is hidden within the blade.

693
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,320
Why didn't you take it and leave?

694
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,479
Per the rules of Fountain Abode,

695
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,760
one thousand golden leaves

696
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:15,840
for an answer.

697
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,399
I think you're too poor for that.

698
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
You ignored the Empyrean Token.

699
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,600
Either something's wrong with you

700
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,120
or something's wrong with the token.

701
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,080
It's a fake token then?

702
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,239
What a vicious scheme.

703
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,439
I already found Yan Yingzhou's body

704
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,560
and buried him in Mount Xuan.

705
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,479
He was stabbed 32 times.

706
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:44,520
I admire his fearlessness.

707
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:45,600
However,

708
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,360
he could use some help
with his martial arts.

709
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,360
Black Foxy.

710
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:55,000
His fearlessness made you feel
all ashamed, didn't it?

711
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:59,040
Everyone knows the bravery
of General Liefeng.

712
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,840
Unlike a certain foxy person.

713
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,199
All his reputation is but a scam.

714
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,879
You need to rest for several days.

715
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,760
Don't overexert yourself.

716
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,399
Sir, the medicinal broth is ready.

717
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,959
I was thinking,

718
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,840
if you came in contact with the
poison from decaying vines

719
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
and you couldn't make it,

720
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,479
then

721
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,959
this world

722
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,040
would only have one Fengxi left.

723
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,479
Why did you save me then?

724
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,080
I won't be grateful for you, you know.

725
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,479
I won't blame you

726
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:31,879
if you leave me to my own devices.

727
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,719
But you, Black Foxy,

728
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,000
are always plotting for something.

729
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,560
I saved you for the Empyrean Token.

730
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,320
Unfortunately, the token is fake.

731
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,320
If you die as well,

732
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:45,600
my investment will be in vain.

733
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,919
It's as if

734
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,320
I have been outwitted by the mastermind.

735
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,239
I hate being outwitted.

736
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,040
Therefore, you can't die.

737
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:54,000
Wait,

738
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,959
you forgot something.

739
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:58,439
If I die,

740
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,919
no one will know your true face.

741
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:03,000
Life will be boring.

742
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,280
Come.

743
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,280
I expended a great deal of effort

744
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,239
to concoct this broth

745
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,439
to save you.

746
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:14,840
You concocted it?

747
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,000
It must be more poisonous
than decaying vines.

748
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,239
Miss Feng.

749
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,399
To save you,

750
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,919
Young Master even used his
much-cherished

751
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:22,679
millennium-old snow lotus.

752
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,000
When you were unconscious, you puked
every time we fed you medicine.

753
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,479
-Zhong Li.
-Young Master had to feed you himself.

754
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,239
When did you become this talkative?

755
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,679
Your tongue can use some snipping.

756
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,399
I will take my leave now.

757
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,000
I'll drink it on my own.

758
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,560
No need to be sanctimonious.

759
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,800
Not many get to be fed medicine by me.

760
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,879
Does

761
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:52,080
the renowned Bai Fengxi

762
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,679
