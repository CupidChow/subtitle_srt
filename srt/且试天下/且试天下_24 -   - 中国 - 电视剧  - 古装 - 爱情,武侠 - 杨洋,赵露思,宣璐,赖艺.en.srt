19

=Episode 24=

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,720
Your Highness.

21
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:44,440
Your Highness.

22
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:46,281
Why the ruckus?

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,121
A flock of ravens flew by.

24
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:48,961
The soldiers saw it

25
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:50,281
and thought it was a bad sign.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,320
Ravens?

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,760
They prefer to dwell
in the mountain or the woods.

28
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:58,760
The winter just ended
so that means they are looking for food.

29
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,720
There are a lot of leftovers

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,040
from the bonfire we had last night.

31
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,720
That's why they came.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,561
But this will dampen our morale.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,720
After all,
the raven is a sign of bad luck.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,281
Not necessarily.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
What do you mean, Miss Fengxi?

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,961
What you did yesterday won their heart

37
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,480
but you have yet
to command their respect.

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,801
Now is your chance.

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,121
To command their respect?

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,320
Even in the past, before we do anything,

41
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,600
we seek a good sign first.

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,801
Revolutionaries like Chen Sheng
and Wu Guang hid notes in the fish.

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,801
Liu Bang slaughtered a white snake.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,081
And now, you have a flock of ravens.

45
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:31,720
Isn't this a good opportunity?

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,521
Giving you the bed last night
was worth it.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,720
Shoo! Shoo!

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,720
This is an omen.

49
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,600
Perhaps God wants us

50
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,121
to avoid Liangcheng.

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,401
This is very bad.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,241
This is God's will!

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
Right. We shouldn't venture further.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,681
Exactly.

55
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,081
No way.

56
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:55,920
Right.

57
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,801
Who said raven is the sign of bad luck?

58
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,801
When Emperor Wu of Zhou
claimed the throne,

59
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,960
ravens gathered on top of the palace.

60
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:04,881
And then, the Zhou dynasty prospered

61
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,641
and eliminated
Emperor Zhou of Shang in one go.

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,600
Thus he began his centuries of legacy.

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,241
Your Highness,
we're not as educated as you.

64
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,280
We know not a thing of what you said.

65
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,761
But there is this cold breeze
in the valley out of a sudden.

66
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:19,321
This is a bad sign.

67
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:21,080
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,160
That is not a cold breeze.

69
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:24,201
It's an updraft.

70
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,641
Updraft lends its strength.

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,641
Ravens sing the song of war.

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
When the founding father of Han,
Liu Bang, killed the white snake,

73
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:37,960
the Han dynasty prospered.

74
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:40,681
I shall do the same today.

75
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,561
Hear me, God from above!

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,641
If I, Feng Lanxi, am meant
to conquer Liangcheng

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,840
and the world,

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,241
deliver your message unto this blade.

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
It worked!

80
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,201
Look!

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
It's an updraft.

82
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,480
Fellow fighters,

83
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:10,400
God has given us the good sign.

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,480
From now on,

85
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:14,001
you will be called Moyu Cavalry.

86
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,001
Moyu Cavalry?

87
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,641
Follow my lead and claim more lands.

88
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,201
Let our name travel far and wide!

89
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:25,001
Moyu Cavalry, the most fearsome cavalry.

90
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,801
Moyu Cavalry,
our name will travel far and wide!

91
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:32,801
Moyu Cavalry,
our name will travel far and wide!

92
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:33,840
He sure

93
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,080
gets it down very quickly.

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,040
Far and wide!

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,241
Moyu Cavalry,
our name will travel far and wide!

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,401
(Liangcheng, Yongzhou)

97
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:43,001
Sir,

98
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,960
the Qingzhou Army
came to provoke us again yesterday.

99
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,361
If this carries on...

100
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:48,881
We'll be seen as afraid of Qingzhou

10101
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:49,472
(Yu Ming, Liangcheng Military Commissioner)
and our morale

10102
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:50,001
(in Yongzhou)
will be affected.

103
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:51,001
Exactly.

104
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:53,241
Qingzhou is just exerting pressure.

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,121
They won't invade.

106
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,241
Sir, I don't understand.

107
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:58,681
If you're certain

108
00:04:58,681 --> 00:04:59,600
that Qingzhou will not invade,

109
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,241
why did you request backup?

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,681
That will only invite your enemies.

111
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,241
Invite my enemies?

112
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,241
Why can't I use them to set an example?

113
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,001
His Lordship wants to rule the world

114
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:11,241
and so he wants Liangcheng to himself.

115
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:12,600
Even if I don't request it,

116
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,361
the backup will come on its own.

117
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,480
What an amazing foresight there,

118
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,641
Sir.

119
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,121
However, I heard that Prince Yongping

120
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:20,881
is among the backup.

121
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,600
Even Queen Baili and Prince Ju

122
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,121
fail to impede his rising power.

123
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,840
My fellow colleagues, don't you know

124
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,600
that even a dragon should be wary
of a nested snake?

125
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,241
When he arrives in Liangcheng,

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,441
if he's a dragon,
he'll be wise to stay still.

127
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,441
If he's anything lesser than,
he'll be wise to lay low.

128
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:37,641
Sir,

129
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,840
Prince Yongping's army is ten li away

130
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,520
from the city's main gate.

131
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,641
I see.

132
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:41,600
Dismissed.

133
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,201
Noted.

134
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,001
I thought this long journey

135
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:47,321
will take at least two weeks.

136
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,520
Prince Yongping is impatient,

137
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,641
isn't he?

138
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,801
Come with me, everyone.

139
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:57,361
Yes, Sir.

140
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:10,009
(Liangcheng)

141
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,321
Didn't they say they had 500 men?

142
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,201
There are

143
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,441
barely 100 here.

144
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,881
Misinformation, perhaps?

145
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,840
Impossible.

146
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,241
Our source did say 500 men.

147
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Perhaps they are not the ones?

148
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,801
Stay alert.

149
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:31,881
Noted.

150
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:33,681
Their horses and arms

151
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,761
will be kept in the western encampment.

152
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:36,480
Yes, Sir.

153
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,801
I'm the military commissioner
of Liangcheng, Yu Ming.

154
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,201
Is Prince Yongping in the wagon?

155
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm Ren Chuanyun,
General of Agile Cavalry.

156
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:57,520
Prince Yongping is seated
in the wagon, indeed.

157
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,720
I heard

158
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,761
His Highness came with 500 men.

159
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:04,080
Why has your number dwindled so?

160
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,840
When we left,

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
we had 500 men with us.

162
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,801
However, a flash flood occurred.

163
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,201
Many were wounded and died.

164
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,960
We only have these few men left.

165
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,920
How is His Highness?

166
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,321
His Highness caught a cold

167
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,361
and is feeling weak.

168
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,561
I apologize for
this sorry state of affairs.

169
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,641
Can we rest up somewhere?

170
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,001
Of course.

171
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,681
I have prepared accommodation

172
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:27,681
for His Highness.

173
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,280
Come with me.

174
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:31,761
As for the soldiers,

175
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,920
you will not enter the city

176
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,480
lest you disrupt the harmony within.

177
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,400
Please

178
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
come with me to the western encampment.

179
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,681
Pardon me, mister.

180
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,960
They

181
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,801
are actually His Highness' servants.

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,040
His everyday routine, from his voyage

183
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,960
to his ablution,

184
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,881
is taken care of by different servants.

185
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:47,720
His Highness is used
to this way of living

186
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,520
so

187
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,681
they had to disguise
themselves as soldiers.

188
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
They are actually servants.

189
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,681
If they are His Highness' servants,

190
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:57,761
they are allowed to go in.

191
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,801
The rest

192
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,121
can go to the western encampment.

193
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,121
Yes, Sir.

194
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:02,881
Thanks, Official Yu.

195
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,361
Come with me.

196
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,960
Official Yu,

197
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,441
His Lordship has asked me
to present your remuneration.

198
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:15,801
Thirty boxes of silver leaves.

199
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:17,321
Where should I deliver them to?

200
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,920
To my residence, of course.

201
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:19,881
Do show me the way.

202
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,121
Here, please.

203
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,280
Your Highness,

204
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,960
the remuneration has been delivered
to the military commissioner's residence.

205
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,201
Moyu guards are stationed outside.

206
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,241
You can relax now, Your Highness.

207
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:40,201
Noted.

208
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,361
Good job.

209
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,561
I already said
there were only our people here.

210
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,720
You can't get out
of the character, can you?

211
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,121
I have to play my part properly.

212
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,600
His Highness knows
Yu Ming is a careful person.

213
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
So he spread the Moyu Cavalry

214
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,480
and stationed most of them
outside of the city.

215
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,600
Only a small amount of people
entered the city.

216
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,361
He even made
the soldiers feign exhaustion

217
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,641
to fool everyone.

218
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:02,840
Yu Ming is a greedy person.

219
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,160
We managed to divert
his attention in time.

220
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,840
However, we still have to be careful.

221
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,801
Are we being watched
from outside the residence?

222
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,600
Yes.

223
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,761
Good thing

224
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:11,840
that His Highness
entered the city first.

225
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,361
It'll be difficult
to leave this place otherwise.

226
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,441
Why are there
so many people hiking today?

227
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,881
There is a temple on this mountain

228
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,480
called Red Sea Snail Temple.

229
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,121
Red Sea Snail Temple?

230
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,040
Which deity does it worship?

231
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,080
I don't think

232
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,960
the red sea snail is a deity at all.

233
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,561
From Nu River to Liangcheng

234
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:31,761
lies the Red Sea Snail River.

235
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,080
A long time ago,

236
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
a scholar

237
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,920
found a red sea snail in the river.

238
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,801
He brought it back home

239
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,160
and the sea snail turned into a lady.

240
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,361
They lived happily ever after

241
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,641
and he built

242
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,400
this Red Sea Snail Temple
on the mountain.

243
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,400
So it's a temple
for relationships and romance.

244
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,160
What do you want from it?

245
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,361
I want

246
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,001
a full view
of Liangcheng's water canals.

247
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,561
They are disorganized.

248
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:14,960
I didn't know you know a thing
about canal management.

249
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:17,361
They look like
they extend in all directions

250
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:18,881
but in reality, they are intertwined.

251
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:20,080
They can't prevent floods at all.

252
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,801
Why are you looking at me?

253
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:31,040
You

254
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,160
always surprise me.

255
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,881
At this rate,

256
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,641
directing the canals to Qingzhou
will not do anything either.

257
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,040
During the spring flood,

258
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,480
many villagers

259
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,641
will suffer from it.

260
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,160
Corrupted government officials

261
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,201
don't care about
the lives of their subjects.

262
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,761
Oh,

263
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:51,681
take this.

264
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,641
Liangcheng isn't safe.

265
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:54,600
This is just a protective charm.

266
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:00,651
(Deity of Romance)

267
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:02,840
So even a deity of romance
hands out protection too?

268
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,361
(Bun)

269
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:27,560
Why is everything in Liangcheng

270
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,241
more expensive than the ones
in the capital of Yongzhou?

271
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,761
A sesame ball

272
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,281
costs three wen in Yongzhou's capital.

273
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,281
But here, it costs five wen for one.

274
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,401
Everyone believes

275
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,161
that in a barren land,
everything will be cheaper.

276
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,001
It is a misconception.

277
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,200
Liangcheng

278
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,761
is close to the border.
There aren't enough crops.

279
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,281
Local agriculture

280
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,720
cannot satisfy the market's demand.

281
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,881
They have to import many things
from other cities.

282
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:54,320
Liangcheng isn't very populated as well

283
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,761
so their importation isn't very high.

284
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,680
They can only import in small batches.

285
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,560
That drives the price up.

286
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,921
I see.

287
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:03,921
In addition,

288
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,600
the human labor here is unorganized

289
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,440
and the trading market
isn't fully developed.

290
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,121
That is the root of the issues.

291
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,480
Come.

292
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,161
Mister, please.

293
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
Life here is very hard.

294
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,041
Almost unbearable.

295
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,080
Quick.

296
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,281
Hurry up!

297
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:32,960
Come.

298
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,641
Do not dally.

299
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:39,560
Do not give them more trouble.

300
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:40,641
Move!

301
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:41,641
Now!

302
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,320
Hurry up.

303
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,320
Move!

304
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,960
Stop dallying.

305
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,960
Mister,

306
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,840
who are they?

307
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,121
I can tell

308
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,361
both of you are foreigners.

309
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,521
They are forced to build the canals.

310
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,001
Why will they be forced

311
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:00,641
to build the canals?

312
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,361
The government has sent in the money

313
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,600
so everyone should be
more than happy to work for it.

314
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,361
The money government sent in

315
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,001
will not fall into our hands.

316
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,361
To build the dam,

317
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:12,241
all able men who can lift

318
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,600
will be forcefully enlisted.

319
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,921
They work days and nights.

320
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,080
Move!

321
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,001
Poor souls.

322
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,401
Enjoy.

323
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,041
Thank you.

324
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,600
If you

325
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:29,800
want to kill those evil officials
in the city,

326
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:32,080
I'll help you.

327
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:40,881
Look how feeble

328
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,121
Prince Yongping is.

329
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:43,121
I don't think it's an act.

330
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
And a flash flood did occur
during their trip.

331
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,001
It's not uncommon to hear soldiers
who abandon their posts,

332
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:48,761
given the circumstances.

333
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,361
I don't think we should be worried.

334
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,001
Their people

335
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:52,800
even came

336
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:53,881
to ask if we have more medicine.

337
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,281
I concur.

338
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,680
Prince Yongping's army

339
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:59,161
and servants
are barely 100 men in total.

340
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,600
They can't do anything at all.

341
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,281
Give it a test

342
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,521
and we'll know if it's all an act.

343
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:07,161
Retrieve the supplements
from the storeroom.

344
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,161
I

345
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,680
will deliver the medicine to him.

346
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:13,600
Thank you for delivering
the medicine in person, Official Yu.

347
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:14,881
No need.

348
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,281
His Highness has had a long trip.

349
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,001
He ought to get some rest.

350
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:20,121
May I know which sickness
His Highness has?

351
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,761
Emphysema.

352
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,921
I used to study medicine.

353
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:27,241
Perhaps I can have a look
at His Highness?

354
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
No need for the hassle, Official Yu.

355
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:29,921
It's no bother at all, General Ren.

356
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,881
It is my honor to serve His Highness.

357
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:34,680
Official Yu...

358
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,881
You dare to stop me?

359
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,440
Respect Official Yu!

360
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:54,881
Your Highness.

361
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:55,641
Your Highness.

362
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,680
The loyal Official Yu is merely
concerned about my health.

363
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:02,521
Why did you stop him?

364
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:03,161
Go

365
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,161
and take ten lashes.

366
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,161
Yes.

367
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:07,680
Apologies, Your Highness.

368
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,401
Your Highness,
your emphysema is quite serious.

369
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:18,041
I've had it since I was little.

370
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:20,080
The journey to Liangcheng
was a rocky one, to say the least.

371
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,161
There were storms and winds.

372
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,401
Fret not.

373
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:25,800
I have brought with me
some excellent medicinal herbs.

374
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,161
They are good for your lungs.

375
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:28,680
Rest well for a few days

376
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,281
and you'll be fully recovered.

377
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,840
Thanks, Official Yu.

378
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,840
Since His Lordship sent you here,

379
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,161
the commander's tally
and military seal of Liangcheng Army

380
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,361
will be given to you.

381
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,361
No need.

382
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,361
I am still unwell.

383
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,480
Please handle Liangcheng
and its 16 military branches

384
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,720
for me, Official Yu.

385
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,041
I...

386
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,121
Do not worry.

387
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:58,401
Father

388
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,440
sent me here to support Liangcheng.

389
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:05,161
You're still
the Southern Military Commissioner.

390
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:07,600
Well...

391
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,521
As you wish, Your Highness.

392
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,680
I shall take my leave now.

393
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,361
Cunning as a fox.

394
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:29,800
He used this pretty excuse

395
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:30,840
to test Your Highness.

396
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:33,401
Fortunately, you came back in time.

397
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,800
Otherwise, this plan will fail.

398
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,600
Yu Ming.

399
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,001
Liangcheng.

400
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:44,440
Proceed with the plan.

401
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,161
Send all the secret agents out.

402
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,641
Dissect Liangcheng's defense

403
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:49,440
as soon as possible.

404
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:50,680
Yes, Sir.

405
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:55,001
Congratulations, Sir.

406
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,080
This Prince Yongping is dumb enough

407
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,921
to turn down the offer of
the commander's tally and military seal.

408
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,041
No, it's just too foolish a move

409
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,241
and that's why it's suspicious.

410
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,080
I have met all walks of life.

411
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,161
But no dog

412
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
will refuse when it's presented

413
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:16,041
with a steamy meat bun.

414
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,641
Either

415
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,320
this dog is insane

416
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,041
or this dog doesn't want the bun

417
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,281
but the feeder.

418
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,840
The intel we have right now

419
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,680
is far from enough.

420
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,600
Ask them to continue investigating.

421
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,521
Yes, Sir.

422
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:40,440
Father.

423
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,800
Master Wang Shuilong wishes to see you.

424
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:44,921
Let him in.

425
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:45,761
Yes, Father.

426
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,521
Master Bai.

427
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,960
I have bad news.

428
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,680
Zeng Jiuhai is dead.

429
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,680
So my hypothesis is right.

430
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:10,080
The one who forged
the fake Empyrean Token

431
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,361
is among the Token Keepers.

432
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,960
Zeng must have found something

433
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,041
and was promptly silenced.

434
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,680
After I found out that Zeng was killed,

435
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,241
I returned to the inn.

436
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:28,361
However, I noticed that
Zeng had reserved a room.

437
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,241
I worried that the culprits

438
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:31,361
would trace back to the inn

439
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,521
so I left the Imperial City overnight.

440
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,320
Did Zeng

441
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,480
leave any clue?

442
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,320
I found

443
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,881
Zeng's luggage in his room.

444
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,521
A spectacular Han White Marble.

445
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,680
Only an important figure

446
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,761
in the Imperial City

447
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:11,960
can wear it.

448
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,680
It seems

449
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,440
we have to visit the Imperial City.

450
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,717
(With Yan Ling as their leader,
Grand Tutor Ran's men plan to revolt.)

451
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,480
(Jizhou is making
a major move this time.)

452
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,881
Sir, news from the Imperial City.

453
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:34,600
(Confidential)
Sir, news from the Imperial City.

454
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:46,881
A swift investigation.

455
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,480
So the Token Keepers found out?

456
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:51,960
However,

457
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,600
my spy in the capital of Yongzhou
has dealt with him.

458
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,281
I proposed this fake Empyrean Token ruse

459
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,761
to His Majesty.

460
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:01,401
However, Bai Fengxi came out of nowhere

461
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
and disrupted our plan.

462
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,960
There are three fake tokens.

463
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,361
One of them must have found its way
to the Token Keepers

464
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:09,480
so they found out this soon.

465
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,641
It doesn't matter anyway.

466
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,600
We just have to expedite the execution.

467
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,241
Give this to Huang Chao.

468
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:17,800
Noted.

469
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:23,560
Sir, now that your blood curse
is temporarily suppressed

470
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,241
and the Cricket army
is growing in number.

471
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,600
We can

472
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:28,720
part with Huang Chao now.

473
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:31,281
Not now.

474
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,960
The world is in a box now.

475
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:34,600
We need a key.

476
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,960
Huang Chao has talent and ambition.

477
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,320
He is the best key.

478
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,161
Once we help him unite Jizhou,

479
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,840
if everything goes well,

480
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,641
he'll set his eyes on the world.

481
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,720
When the time comes,

482
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,161
no one can stop this war anymore.

483
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,881
But shouldn't you be worried

484
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,080
that Huang Chao might grow
too strong to be manipulated?

485
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,881
The stronger he is,
the more enemies he has.

486
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:01,921
My enemy's enemy is my ally.

487
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:03,200
Besides,

488
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,960
if he has the same talent as Cao Mengde,

489
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,720
I'll be his Sima Zhongda then.

490
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,121
But your ancestors' wish...

491
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,440
Who says

492
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,641
you can't rule the world

493
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,121
from beyond the throne?

494
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,001
Anything unusual

495
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:30,121
from Prince Yongping lately?

496
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,560
Our people have been watching
him closely.

497
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:33,401
Their guards

498
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,361
watch over the residence

499
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,401
in shifts too.

500
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,960
Nothing too unusual.

501
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:39,001
Nothing?

502
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:40,680
I think Prince Yongping

503
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,401
saw how united we are here in Liangcheng

504
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,761
and simply gave up.

505
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,200
After all, he's in Liangcheng now.

506
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,121
He can rack his brain

507
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,440
but he still won't be able

508
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,600
to touch you.

509
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,960
Too calm.

510
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,600
Too many concessions.

511
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,680
They are not good signs.

512
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,401
Sir, a letter
from the capital of Yongzhou.

513
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,881
I sent my people to investigate
in the capital of Yongzhou

514
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,401
to find out

515
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:14,161
who Prince Yongping is.

516
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,521
According to the letter,

517
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,761
while Prince Yongping
is an intelligent man,

518
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,281
his health is deteriorating.

519
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,600
In the capital,

520
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,480
he was set up by Queen Baili many times

521
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,080
and could barely
get out alive each time.

522
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:27,881
Nothing out of the ordinary
from the letter.

523
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,800
Everything aligns too perfectly

524
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,840
and that raises suspicion.

525
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,401
Didn't His Highness

526
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,960
say he was here to support Liangcheng?

527
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,121
Let's hold a feast
to raise the army's morale.

528
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,560
He

529
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,320
has to attend it no matter what.

530
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:46,761
Half a jin of rice, please.

531
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,001
Ten wen.

532
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,440
Rice! Top-quality rice!

533
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,800
Have a look!

534
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,480
Animal skin! Have a look.

535
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,921
Mister, do you want some rice?

536
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,960
Can I have some?

537
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:00,761
Sure.

538
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,720
Rice!

539
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,080
Top-quality rice!

540
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,641
Here, Mister.

541
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,161
Your rice.

542
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,161
Your Highness,

543
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,600
this is

544
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,281
Liangcheng's defense plan
we found lately.

545
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,320
They set up quite an expensive
and elaborate defense.

546
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,401
As expected from Yu Ming
who governed Liangcheng for 20 years.

547
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,761
He put the people's riches
into his own pocket.

548
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,680
That's a corrupted official.

549
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:46,320
Yu Ming is very careful.

550
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,641
He doesn't trust anyone easily.

551
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:49,281
That will be our chance.

552
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:50,200
Look.

553
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,840
This is his weak spot.

554
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:53,800
Yes.

555
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,281
As long as we take over
the city defense,

556
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,480
Liangcheng's traffic

557
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,121
will be paralyzed.

558
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,361
Any update from the Moyu Cavalry?

559
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:01,241
All of them have entered the city.

560
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,720
Chuanyun has been setting
everything up in secret.

561
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,121
The entire Moyu Cavalry
is ready to take up their arms.

562
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:05,241
With one order from you,

563
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,281
they'll fight right away.

564
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,440
Now,

565
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,480
we just need an opening.

566
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,281
Oh, Minister Feng sent us a letter.

567
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
Yu Ming sent someone
to the capital of Yongzhou

568
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,001
to investigate you.

569
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,041
Fortunately, she has prepared for it

570
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:18,361
and has synchronized
everyone's testimony.

571
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,800
Synchronized?

572
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:25,720
It seems like Yu Ming
is about to make a move.

573
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,361
I don't get it,

574
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,480
Your Highness.

575
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,200
I...

576
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,080
Whenever you investigate someone,

577
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,440
different sources will give you
different testimonies.

578
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,401
There will be contradictions.

579
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,761
However, a unanimous testimony

580
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,800
will only raise suspicion.

581
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,641
There you go.

582
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,480
Your Highness, Official Yu
has left you a message.

583
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:47,600
He said

584
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:49,440
that the Qingzhou Army
around Liangcheng is on the move.

585
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:50,600
He plans

586
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,641
to go on the offensive
within a few days.

587
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,680
To raise the army's morale,

588
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,521
there will be a feast tonight
in his residence.

589
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,320
He has extended his invitation to you.

590
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,320
Tell Official Yu

591
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,761
that I will be there tonight.

592
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,440
Will do.

593
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,241
A feast?

594
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,720
It's more like a trap.

595
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,080
It's a trap.

596
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:09,921
But for whom?

597
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,241
We shall see.

598
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,680
Just when I said I needed an opening,

599
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:15,200
an opening presented itself.

600
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,401
You mean...

601
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:18,800
Tell Chuanyun

602
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,401
to get ready.

603
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,121
Yes, Your Highness.

604
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:22,680
I'll come with you.

605
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,921
Okay.

606
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:33,800
Sir,

607
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:35,281
everything is ready.

608
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,080
His Highness has arrived!

609
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:40,521
Greetings, Your Highness.

610
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,281
Fellow officials.

611
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,121
You may get up.

612
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,001
Thank you, Your Highness.

613
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:01,080
Are you still unwell,

614
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
Your Highness?

615
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:03,480
It's okay.

616
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:06,200
Here, please, Your Highness.

617
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,840
Have a seat.

618
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:19,921
Official Yu.

619
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:21,720
I have issues
with how you arrange the seats.

620
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,600
Insolence!

621
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:27,200
I am loyal to Yongzhou.

622
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:30,080
Are you questioning me, General Ren?

623
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:30,720
You...

624
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,200
When His Lordship
ascended to the throne,

625
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:34,840
he once came to Liangcheng.

626
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,121
Our seats were arranged like this.

627
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:40,361
General Ren,
now that you make a fuss out of it,

628
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,241
aren't you just trying to sow discord

629
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:43,600
between Liangcheng and His Highness?

630
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,401
Your Highness.

631
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
A war is nigh.

632
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:50,440
He is destabilizing the military.

633
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,361
Please make a wise decision.

634
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:56,720
Ren Chuanyu.

635
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,521
How dare you!

636
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,440
I...

637
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,041
For your protection thus far,

638
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:01,840
get out of my sight!

639
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,560
Stop causing troubles here.

640
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,200
Yes, Your Highness.

641
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

642
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:18,121
Father sent me here
to take over Liangcheng.

643
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,600
I'm new here

644
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:20,720
so I might not know everything.

645
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:22,761
I count on your assistance,

646
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,881
my dear officials.

647
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,080
Fret not, Your Highness.

648
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:28,121
Official Yu has defended
the southern frontier for many years.

649
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:30,001
He is one of the rare and
capable ministers from the court.

650
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,921
Under Official Yu's guidance,

651
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:34,200
Liangcheng will surely prosper.

652
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,080
Please have a seat.

653
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

654
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,401
Official Yu.

655
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,401
Enjoy, Your Highness.

656
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:45,521
You too.

657
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:47,600
Don't go, General Ren.

658
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:48,680
Calm down.

659
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:50,200
There are tables ready
by the side hall too.

660
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,320
Why don't we go there instead?

661
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,960
No, thanks.

662
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:53,560
His Highness asked me to leave.

663
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:54,480
I don't have the cheekiness in me

664
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,241
to stay.

665
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,001
You think

666
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,161
you can leave?

667
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:04,041
Wu.

668
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,881
Come with me, Sir.

669
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:05,440
All right.

670
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:09,641
Liu.

671
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,560
Sir.

672
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,881
We have complete control
over the residence now.

673
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:15,161
General Chuanyun is in charge
of the outer parameter

674
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:16,241
and has blocked all egresses too.

675
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:17,440
They cannot escape.

676
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,001
Good. Move now.

677
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:19,840
Yes, Sir.

678
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,000
Your Highness.

679
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:36,000
A toast.

680
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,481
Thank you, Official Yu.

681
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:51,721
A toast to Your Highness.

682
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,721
Sure.

683
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:56,600
Fill it up.

684
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,840
Cheers.

685
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,240
A toast to Your Highness.

686
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,201
Fill it up again.

687
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:20,760
Your Highness.

688
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:22,121
Your health matters.

689
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,240
Drink in moderation.

690
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:26,961
Does this court lady

691
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
come from the Royal Palace?

692
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,481
She's loyal and beautiful.

693
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,361
What a breathtaking beauty.

694
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:36,520
All officials here
want to give me a toast.

695
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,520
If I don't take it,

696
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:41,681
will you take it?

697
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,441
I have always heard

698
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,600
that Prince Yongping is an elegant man.

699
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:48,080
Even your way of imbibing

700
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:49,721
is enviable.

701
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:58,681
This is our local fine brew.

702
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:02,121
We only serve it
to the most esteemed of guests.

703
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:09,800
All right.

704
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:11,641
I shall savor it,

705
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,681
of course.

706
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,600
Divine.

707
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:27,520
Simply divine.

708
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:30,080
Of course.

709
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,520
Your Highness?

710
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:53,600
Your Highness?

711
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,161
Your Highness?

712
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,641
Your Highness?

713
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:04,000
Your Highness?

714
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,240
Your Highness?

715
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,681
Your Highness!

716
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:28,481
Don't move!

717
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:29,881
Don't move!

718
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,560
Don't move!

719
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,201
What liquor is this?

720
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,961
Thousand Days of Stupor.

721
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,560
How benevolent of you, Official Yu.

722
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,600
You would let me live!

723
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,080
You just want to control me
with the devil's trumpet

724
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,040
You just want to control me
with the devil's trumpet

725
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,161
so that I can be your puppet.

726
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,240
That way, the Royal Court
will not suspect anything.

727
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,361
Fortunately, I suppressed it
with my inner force.

728
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:17,040
You think you won, Your Highness?

729
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:19,280
Official Yu,

730
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:22,121
are you waiting for your soldiers?

731
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,320
What a pity.

732
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,121
Your Highness.

733
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,721
Moyu Cavalry has penetrated
the city defense.

734
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,320
Liangcheng Army
has surrendered their arms.

735
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,560
As expected from Prince Yongping.

736
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,040
I thought I was careful enough

737
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,721
but I still walked into your trap.

738
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
However, I am
very familiar with Liangcheng.

739
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,040
If you want to rule this city,

740
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,481
I can lend you my aid.

741
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:45,121
You said you were familiar
with Liangcheng?

742
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:47,121
Do you mean

743
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:48,560
exploiting the commoners?

744
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:50,481
Your governance

745
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,280
is all built on lies.

746
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,721
People like you

747
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,201
deserve to die.

748
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:55,921
Your Highness!

749
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:58,681
I...

750
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:06,361
I was tasked
with the governance of Liangcheng.

751
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,721
I'm new here
so I might not know everything.

752
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:10,560
I count on your assistance,

753
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,121
my dear officials.

754
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,881
I swear absolute loyalty to you,
Your Highness.

755
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:29,443
(Dadong)

756
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:32,641
Look at the elaborate formation!

757
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:35,401
Who is the person?

758
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:38,201
I heard she's the Princess of Youzhou.

759
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,800
Princess of Youzhou?

760
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:40,840
The Princess Chunran?

761
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:41,961
Yes.

762
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:43,161
She's the prettiest lady in Youzhou!

763
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,560
Exactly.

764
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,240
Why is she escorted
by so many guards then?

765
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,800
Are they afraid of a pervert

766
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:49,840
who will kidnap her?

767
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:51,921
Princess Chunran come here

768
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,560
to deliver the sarira to His Majesty.

769
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:58,361
I heard the sarira
is the embodiment of good merits.

770
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,921
Although they lost their Empyrean Token,
they received a sarira.

771
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,280
It seems like the Imperial Family

772
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,080
is in God's favor.

773
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:06,921
Dadong Empire will still be peaceful.

774
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:08,481
Indeed.

775
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,760
She's here!

776
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:14,080
Your Highness.

777
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,280
You're now in the Lotus Palace.

778
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,080
When Dadong Empire
was first established,

779
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,201
our founding father,
devoted to Buddhism as he was,

780
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,401
invited a reverend
to plant a lotus in the garden.

781
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:24,641
Hence the name.

782
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,881
I see.

783
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
His Majesty opted

784
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,961
to keep the sarira here

785
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,121
to complete this wonderful story.

786
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:34,280
Indeed.

787
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,121
His Majesty has arrived!

788
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,320
Princess Chunran, you're pious.

789
00:35:45,881 --> 00:35:50,000
No wonder the sarira
appeared in Youzhou.

790
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,401
I, Hua Chunran,
was sent here by my father

791
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,201
to deliver the sarira
and to pay respect to the Buddha.

792
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,721
Your Majesty.

793
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,721
Look!

794
00:35:58,161 --> 00:35:59,280
The lotuses have bloomed!

795
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,760
A sacred maiden delivers the sarira
and lotuses bloom wherever she goes.

796
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,280
Oh, how blessed the Dadong Empire is!

797
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,080
Congratulations.

798
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:16,320
Felicitations.

799
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,721
May the Imperial Family
prosper for eternity.

800
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:24,560
Under the blessing
of Princess Chunran and Lord of Youzhou,

801
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,681
no harm will come to Dadong Empire.

802
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,681
It will prosper forever!

803
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,481
Announce

804
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:35,401
this merry news to everyone!

805
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:37,080
Besides,

806
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:41,121
Princess Chunran did a marvelous job
in delivering the sarira.

807
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,240
She will be given the title of
the Divine Fairy of Dadong Empire.

808
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:47,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

809
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,600
(Imperial Palace of Dadong Empire)

810
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,639
Congratulations, Your Highness.

811
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,800
The lotus and flowers
were in full bloom.

812
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,159
You shot to fame with this feat.

813
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,199
It was nothing but some tricks.

814
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,000
I asked a eunuch

815
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,840
to heat the buds until
they pried open beforehand.

816
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Is everything done?

817
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:06,719
Don't worry, Your Highness.

818
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,199
He was handsomely rewarded.

819
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,320
The secret is safe.

820
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,120
But, why must you go through
all the trouble for this?

821
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,479
You didn't need to transport
the sarira on foot

822
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,120
all the way to the Imperial City.

823
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,560
That was the only way

824
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,919
to live up to the name of
Divine Fairy of Dadong.

825
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
To earn that title,

826
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,080
I need more than just a rank
given by His Majesty.

827
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,280
I need the people
to know the story.

828
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,000
They love to exaggerate stories.

829
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,840
When words start to
spread among the people,

830
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,919
the story will be overly exaggerated.

831
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,320
My reputation as the Divine Fairy

832
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,320
shall be known by
the entire Dadong Empire.

833
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,439
Only then will I truly
live up to the title.

834
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,159
What we did today
was a small price to pay.

835
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,199
You are already
the greatest beauty alive.

836
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,320
When His Lordship wants
to get you a husband,

837
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,000
the other States responded quickly.

838
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,399
Even the most prestigious
Prince Huang Chao

839
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:00,239
responded.

840
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:03,399
Is it really necessary to earn
the title of the Divine Fairy?

841
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,959
I need the prestigious title

842
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,120
to stand on equal ground with them.

843
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,399
Only then can I have leverage.

844
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,639
(Besides,)

845
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,679
