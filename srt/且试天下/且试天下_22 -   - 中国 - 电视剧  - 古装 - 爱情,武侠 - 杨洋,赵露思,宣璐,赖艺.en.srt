20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
There is only one way for you

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,160
to become the heir of Lord.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
You must make His Lordship
become wary of Prince Lanxi.

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,761
His Lordship understands
the importance of balance above all.

24
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,920
He would never allow his heir

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,121
to outshine him.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,481
Your Highness.

27
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,000
I will give Your Highness a sachet

28
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,761
that contains the methods
to use against Prince Lanxi.

29
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:12,321
However, it can only be opened

30
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:13,641
after he leaves the capital of Yongzhou.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,761
Why?

32
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:18,801
Your Highness will know
when the time comes.

33
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,160
One more thing.

34
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:24,521
I will need Your Highness
to put up a performance with me.

35
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:27,680
Your Highness,

36
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,400
I have investigated
the situation in Liangcheng.

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,641
Please take a look.

38
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:40,321
Liangcheng is located
at the borders between Yongzhou and Qingzhou.

39
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,601
It is surrounded by rapid waters too.

40
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,160
It may be
a secret military training ground,

41
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,401
but it is occupied
by the military commissioner,

42
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,440
Yu Ming, all year round.

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,641
Even if a royal decree is issued,

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,081
it's hard to say
if things will go smoothly.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,440
To control the city,

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,720
Yu Ming suggested

47
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:00,081
that a dam should be built
above the rapid rivers.

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,481
However, my people have reported

49
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,960
that the progress of the construction
had been extremely slow.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,680
It is simply a front.

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,801
If Your Highness leaves for Liangcheng,

52
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
we'll have to get rid of him first.

53
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,041
Thank you, Mentor.

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,680
I made the decision to go to Liangcheng.

55
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:20,280
No matter how difficult the journey is,

56
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:22,240
I will have to carry on.

57
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,280
However, the rules

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,680
forbid princes

59
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:28,160
from forming vassal states
or leaving the capital.

60
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,120
Have you thought about
how you will get there, Your Highness?

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,041
The spring tide should be coming soon.

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,761
Yu Ming claims he is building the dam.

63
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,481
The spring tide will be our chance.

64
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,201
Your Highness.

65
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:46,801
Prince Ju went to Yu Wuyuan's residence

66
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:48,560
right after the court meeting.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,321
However, he didn't stay for long

68
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,120
before he was led out
by Yu Wuyuan's servant.

69
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,041
But when he left,

70
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,960
he didn't look happy.

71
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,641
He might have had
a fallout with Yu Wuyuan.

72
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,321
Yu Wuyuan left the capital
with his servants

73
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,120
right afterward.

74
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:03,601
He left?

75
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:05,881
Was he not the mastermind

76
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,000
behind the scheme?

77
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:12,361
Perhaps he realized
he was no match for His Highness

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,440
and ran away?

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,960
Yu Wuyuan is not someone
who admits defeat easily.

80
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:16,960
There were many loopholes

81
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:18,720
in the treasury theft case.

82
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,120
It didn't seem like his style.

83
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,400
However, Ju is persistent.

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,680
That's why he had no choice
but to leave the capital of Yongzhou.

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
That should be the case.

86
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,280
What will we do about Prince Ju then?

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,081
Continue to keep an eye on him.

88
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,720
He won't give up easily.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
Yu Wuyuan has left,

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,201
but I'm afraid Ju will come up
with something else.

91
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,521
Yes, Your Highness.

92
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,000
Sirs.

93
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,120
This is the leader
of the Tianshuang Sect,

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,801
Bai Jiande.

95
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:46,801
Like us,

96
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,240
he is a Token Keeper as well.

97
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,321
This is the Head of Escort
of the Jiuhai Security Escort of Jizhou,

98
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,081
Zeng Jiuhai.

99
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,240
This is the owner
of the Xiangyun Wares of Beizhou,

100
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,120
Qian Henian.

101
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,440
Greetings.

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
These are the two Token Keepers

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
that I know.

104
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,361
Token Keepers

105
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:07,680
are not to meet in secret.

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
For what reason did you have Master Wang

107
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,321
ask us to come
to the capital of Yongzhou?

108
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,361
I am aware of that.

109
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,560
However, something bad has happened,

110
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:18,440
and I am injured.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,761
That is why I had Master Wang
ask both of you to come here.

112
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,881
Sirs.

113
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:25,801
Please look at this.

114
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
T... This token is fake.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,361
It does look incredibly similar
to the real thing, however.

116
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:36,761
Master Bai,

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
where did you get this?

118
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,440
I acquired it by chance.

119
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,560
Miss Fengxi from Master Bai's sect

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,120
once acquired a fake token as well.

121
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
It was later handed over to
the heir of Lord of Jizhou, Huang Chao.

122
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,400
That means

123
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:49,720
the token that was robbed

124
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,160
when Prince Huang Chao
was escorting it to the Imperial City

125
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,400
was fake too.

126
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Precisely.

127
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,840
Someone is using
the fake tokens to stir up chaos.

128
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:58,361
As Token Keepers,

129
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:59,440
we know

130
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,361
just how important
the Empyrean Token is.

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,280
That is why I've been secretly
investigating the matter.

132
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,321
I asked

133
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,881
Mr. Fengxi
of the Fountain Abode for help.

134
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,400
A few days ago,

135
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,481
he informed me
that the Gongye Zhi, an ironsmith

136
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,680
who is also a Token Keeper like us,
was missing.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
I suspect that he was the one

138
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,800
who forged the fake tokens.

139
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:25,401
And the person who conspired with him

140
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
is very likely

141
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,521
a Token Keeper as well.

142
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,480
This is a grave matter.

143
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,360
Did you ask us to come here

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
because you suspect us?

145
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,321
No.

146
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,920
I seek your help
to assist me in finding out

147
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,321
who else is a Token Keeper.

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,321
That will allow me

149
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,680
to solve the case sooner as well.

150
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,680
Please be assured, Master Bai.

151
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,800
We will not sit idly by.

152
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,600
Thank you,

153
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
everyone.

154
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,120
Your Highness! It's the first snow!

155
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:12,480
The first snow!

156
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,600
The first snow?

157
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,360
You mean

158
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,560
this is a suitable scenery to do it?

159
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:26,841
Your Highness.

160
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,521
The first snow to bring spring
and scenery of snow-white.

161
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
It's the perfect time
for you to confess, Your Highness.

162
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,000
Your Highness,

163
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,841
you don't have to be so nervous.

164
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,081
Think about it.

165
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,161
You've known Miss Fengxi for so long,

166
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,841
and both of you have been through
life-and-death situations together.

167
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm sure Miss Fengxi
harbors feelings for you too.

168
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,641
I don't think

169
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,521
it will be as difficult as you imagine.

170
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,360
Do I look nervous?

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,881
Tell me

172
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:22,120
what you think of me.

173
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,841
Well... Of course,
you're a man among men, Your Highness.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,521
You are dashing, remarkable,

175
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,281
and dignified.

176
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,721
You would stand out

177
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,120
even among a sea of people.

178
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,281
Nice flattery.

179
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,600
Your Highness.

180
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:37,000
If we go by the stories,

181
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,521
this is how it would go...

182
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,881
The first snow of the new year
drifts profusely and disorderly.

183
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:56,721
A beautiful sight indeed.

184
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:00,920
Are you talking about the snow

185
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,641
or me?

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Both.

187
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:09,401
It's a bit dull

188
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:10,841
just to gaze at the snow.

189
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,281
Why don't we play a game?

190
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,881
Let's see

191
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,761
which of us can find these three things
within the capital of Yongzhou.

192
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:20,401
The first item.

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Something whiter than snow.

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,721
The second item.

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,081
Something warmer
than the furnace in winter.

196
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,281
The third item.

197
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,721
Something colder than the stones
buried beneath the snow.

198
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:38,281
How about it?

199
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,000
Whiter than snow,

200
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:42,360
warmer than fire,

201
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:44,680
and colder than stone.

202
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:46,040
All right.

203
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:47,521
You're on.

204
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,321
Don't be a sore loser if I win.

205
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:50,881
Of course.

206
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,401
What?

207
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:06,201
Are you already trying to cheat?

208
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,920
No.

209
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,240
I have already won.

210
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,201
I know.

211
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:18,000
You must have already
prepared the three items,

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,641
right?

213
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,120
Show them to me.

214
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:23,360
What I am looking for

215
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:24,761
is right

216
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:26,680
before me.

217
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,201
I will always be by her side.

218
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,360
It's you.

219
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:42,920
Well, tell me

220
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
how I am whiter than snow.

221
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,281
Even amidst the falling snow,

222
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,240
your plain robes

223
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,081
stand out.

224
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,120
Naturally, you are whiter than the snow.

225
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
Why am I warmer than a furnace, then?

230
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
but I can still sense your feelings.

Was I wrong?

238
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:34,000
Since you claim
that my gaze is piercingly hot,

Qiwu, Qingzhou's hot pot

262
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:15,081
is the perfect dish to have

263
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
on a cold day like this.

264
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
I've heard that Qingzhou's hot pot is

265
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,680
particularly spicy.

266
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,641
I'm used to a light diet.

267
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,201
I don't dare to try this.

268
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,360
This boiling pot of red soup

269
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:26,641
can be intimidating,

270
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,201
but it has a nice name.

271
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,240
"To Dine On Dusk."

272
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:30,480
Back then,

273
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,281
people loved to gather their friends

274
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,560
to drink wine and share a meal together.

275
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,161
They could choose whatever they liked
and enjoy it with wine.

276
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:37,321
A wonderful time, indeed.

277
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,800
After that, they would recite poetry
about the resplendent sight

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,480
of the afterglow of the sunset
and the river beneath it.

279
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,521
That is how the name came to be.

280
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,641
You

281
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,440
should put words into action

282
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:47,440
and give it a try yourself.

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,480
Come on.

284
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:49,961
Try it.

285
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,000
What do you think?

286
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,040
Isn't it spicy and satisfying?

287
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,560
Drink some liquor. Hurry.

288
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,240
What do you think about the aftertaste?

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,680
When it first enters my mouth,

290
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:17,521
I taste how spicy it is.

291
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,440
I can't feel
anything else but the spice.

292
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,040
However, there's a lingering fragrance.

293
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,560
It is a unique taste.

294
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:27,800
This hot pot broth is made

295
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,401
from a stir-fried mix of chili peppers,

296
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,881
peppercorn, and beef.

297
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,040
That is what it tastes like.

298
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,120
Miss Feng.

299
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,440
You know so much
about Qingzhou's hot pot.

300
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:37,881
Are you from Qingzhou?

301
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,201
Of course.

302
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,281
Feng is the national surname of Qingzhou.

303
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
Qingzhou must be a place

304
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,321
where heroines are born indeed.

305
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:46,920
First, there was Lord Feng, the founder,

306
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,401
then came Princess Xiyun,

307
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,201
and now we have you, Miss Feng.

308
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,281
How enviable.

309
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,840
What's there to envy?

310
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,000
All three

311
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
of us

312
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
were only doing

313
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:58,561
what we wanted to do.

314
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,801
I believe everyone

315
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,720
should be equal in this world.

316
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,921
Especially men and women.

317
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:04,281
Everyone should be able

318
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,641
to do what they want to do.

319
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,401
That goes for you too, Qiwu.

320
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,600
What you just said

321
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:12,761
calls for a toast.

322
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,000
Here.

323
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh, right. Qiwu,

324
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,641
let's dress up as men

325
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,120
and go horse riding in the wild

326
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,161
and patronize
the courtesan houses someday.

327
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:30,881
Let's not let ourselves be bound
by the constraints they place on women.

328
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,161
All right!

329
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,681
Your Highness.

330
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,480
Miss Fengxi wasn't at the residence.

331
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:20,320
Where did she go?

332
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,161
Miss Fengxi spent
the entire day with Minister Feng.

333
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,041
The whole day?

334
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,561
The servants
of Minister Feng's residence said

335
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,360
they left early in the morning.

336
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,441
They browsed the streets,

337
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,200
had Qingzhou-style hot pot,

338
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,441
and went to watch an opera performance
in the afternoon.

339
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,960
She only returned after dinner.

340
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,720
Well, she sure had an exciting day.

341
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:45,641
Don't be troubled, Your Highness.

342
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,281
Even if today didn't work out,

343
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:49,921
there are still other chances.

344
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,281
If necessary,
we still have the Lantern Festival,

345
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,080
Double Seventh Festival,
and the Mid-autumn Festival.

346
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:58,041
I mean,

347
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,801
apart from these festivities,

348
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,401
we can also
create the atmosphere ourselves.

349
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,161
You're right. How could I forget?

350
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:09,720
Do we still have fireworks?

351
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,761
Fireworks?

352
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,521
Yes.

353
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,681
A firework setting
is a tactic in novels too.

354
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,881
Tomorrow,

355
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:18,681
invite her over again.

356
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Miss Feng.

357
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,120
Zhong Li.

358
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,881
Miss Feng,

359
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,521
His Highness invites you
to have dinner tonight

360
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:29,761
at the House of Jade.

361
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,881
Did he need to see me about something?

362
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:33,161
I have plans today.

363
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,681
If it's just a meal,

364
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:35,441
could we do it on another day?

365
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,281
You'll know when you get there.

366
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,960
His Highness appeared anxious.

367
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:42,441
All right. Got it.

368
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,441
Do remember.
A quarter after seven in the evening.

369
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:46,521
I will.

370
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:50,360
Miss,

371
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,080
you've been smiling

372
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,200
more often.

373
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,441
Really?

374
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:56,401
Yes.

375
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:58,600
You've changed quite a bit

376
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,281
ever since you met Miss Fengxi.

377
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,960
Now,

378
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,441
I can understand

379
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,521
what His Highness sees in her.

380
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:08,360
It's a pity Miss Fengxi is a member
of the martial arts world.

381
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,401
If His Highness were to marry her,

382
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:11,960
I fear...

383
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,960
It might be a problem

384
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,441
if it was someone else.

385
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,041
But if it's her,

386
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:18,401
I'm certain

387
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:19,681
neither His Highness

388
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,921
nor Miss Feng

389
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,360
will be stopped.

390
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,840
What about you, miss?

391
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,641
I can only serve

392
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,761
His Highness as a subject in this life.

393
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:31,600
To compare myself to her

394
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,041
would be to give myself
unnecessary trouble.

395
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,000
What is troubling you, Qiwu?

396
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,521
You're here,

397
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Fengxi.

398
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,561
You didn't forget about the promise

399
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:42,600
we made yesterday, did you?

400
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,161
Let's go out.

401
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:45,200
I remember our promise.

402
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,480
Xiao.

403
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:47,960
Prepare three sets of men's attire.

404
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,600
Yes, miss.

405
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,761
Once I get changed
and dress up like a man,

406
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,600
I will look as if I am
the handsome Pan An.

407
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,320
I hope you won't fall for me

408
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,281
when you see how good I look.

409
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:57,360
All right.

410
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:00,360
I will be sure to enjoy
and appreciate your looks.

411
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,681
Hurry.

412
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:02,401
Put it there.

413
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:02,960
- All right.
- Yes.

414
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,801
And you!

415
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,360
Hurry!

416
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,960
Put it over there.

417
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,041
Yes. There's still space there.

418
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:07,320
Yes, sir.

419
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,801
Quickly!

420
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,561
Your Highness.

421
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:14,761
Everything is ready.

422
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:16,080
We're just waiting for Miss Fengxi.

423
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:20,281
Have you prepared the fireworks?

424
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:21,681
Of course.

425
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:22,801
Later,

426
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,881
you need only hold her hand,

427
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:26,320
and I will set off the fireworks

428
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:27,360
as planned.

429
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:30,521
May Your Highness' wishes

430
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:31,641
come true.

431
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:36,120
Go and find out

432
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,921
where she is right now.

433
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:40,120
Understood.

434
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:02,801
How could you bring my lady
to a place like this,

435
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,441
Miss Fengxi?

436
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:04,921
Don't worry, Miss Xiao.

437
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,921
Nothing will happen

438
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:06,881
with me here.

439
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,200
Come in, sirs.

440
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:11,281
Lead the way.

441
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:12,200
Let's go.

442
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:15,561
Please have a seat.

443
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,600
Yesterday,
the first snow graced the capital...

444
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,441
What's going on here?

445
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:19,840
Miss Shao Yin has decided
on the theme...

446
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,521
They are here

447
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,521
to attend the recital
held by Miss Shao Yin.

448
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
The winner

449
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,921
will earn the right
to spend the night with her.

450
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,080
Please enjoy.

451
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:30,000
Thank you.

452
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:33,681
The black tiles stand out

453
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,561
against the white-covered ground.

454
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,681
The cold breeze sends chills.

455
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,200
A partner to share warmth
would be a delight.

456
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:42,960
Miss Shao Yin says

457
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,120
this poem

458
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,360
is a bit too plain and simple.

459
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Fengxi,

460
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,360
what do you think about this poem?

461
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,521
It's as if he is speaking
in colloquial language.

462
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:51,041
It's just like

463
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:53,521
saying

464
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:54,401
this pastry is dry.

465
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,960
Feathers of white
descend from the skies,

466
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:01,281
gently landing upon the branches
blooming with plum blossoms.

467
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,801
I wish to collect them for you,

468
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,761
but I cannot leave
the furnace unattended.

469
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,641
Miss Shao Yin says

470
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:09,960
that this poem

471
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,441
is average.

472
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:13,441
It is much better
than the previous one, though.

473
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,761
However, while your diction is flowery,

474
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,840
most of them come from late poets.

475
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,281
One mustn't pass off
other's work as their own.

476
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:21,921
In that case,

477
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
please recite your poem, sir.

478
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,120
All right.

479
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,441
When I open the windows,
I am greeted by a flurry of white.

480
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
I ponder if spring has come early.

481
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,080
The streets are filled with laughter

482
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,441
as the young and old
make merry in the snow.

483
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,801
- Marvelous.
- A wonderful poem.

484
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,881
The streets are filled with laughter

485
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,120
as the young and old
make merry in the snow.

486
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:57,720
Feng...

487
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:00,000
Mr. Feng.

488
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
You've given life to a snowy night.

489
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,521
Sir,

490
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,441
Miss Shao Yin invites you
to her chambers.

491
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:09,600
Just like that?

492
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,720
There are many other gentlemen
who haven't recited their poems.

493
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,000
Sir.

494
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,561
Your poem

495
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,200
has convinced me.

496
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,840
Go on,

497
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,480
Sir.

498
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:21,200
Every moment of pleasure is priceless.

499
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,881
It is almost seven.

500
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:23,761
Seven?

501
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,200
Do remember.
A quarter after seven in the evening.

502
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,801
(His Highness appeared anxious.)

503
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, no.

504
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:29,761
Qiwu, we have to go.

505
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:30,561
Hurry.

506
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:32,120
Wait.

507
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:35,521
Is my beauty
not up to your standards, Sir?

508
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:37,041
Is that why you are so eager to leave?

509
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,401
Your Highness!

510
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,881
Your Highness.

511
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,441
How is it? Is she here?

512
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:47,600
Not yet.

513
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:50,480
Did something happen?

514
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:53,041
I searched around

515
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:55,720
and found out
that Miss Fengxi and Minister Feng

516
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,801
had dressed up as men

517
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,960
and entered the Xiangle Parlor.

518
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,480
They haven't come out since.

519
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,161
Xiangle Parlor?

520
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:07,161
Wait here.

521
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:08,240
I'll go and find her.

522
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:09,960
Your Highness!

523
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:12,240
You can think little of us,

524
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,801
but you can't slight Miss Shao Yin.

525
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:17,320
I am not.

526
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,641
However, I do have
urgent matters to attend to.

527
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:20,200
Please understand, Miss.

528
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,960
If that's the case,

529
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:24,080
why did you come to the recital?

530
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,881
Did you not come for me?

531
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:27,641
I did not.

532
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,281
However, you valued talents

533
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:31,761
over materials.

534
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,761
I admire your character,

535
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,281
and that is why I joined the recital.

536
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,041
I had no other reason.

537
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:39,161
If I had,

538
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:40,761
I would've prioritized the wrong things

539
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,240
and let your intentions go to waste.

540
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:43,681
I was able to please you

541
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:44,720
with my poem

542
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,681
and added an extra flair
to tonight's recital.

543
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,881
That is enough for me.

544
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:52,281
It is enough to find a kindred spirit
through an exchange of poetry.

545
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,600
You are truly
a distinguished character, Sir.

546
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,401
I've learned something new from you.

547
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,480
Sir,

548
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:08,960
the recital is over.

549
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,480
Please come again tomorrow.

550
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,281
Hold on.

551
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,521
What is the meaning of this?

552
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,441
You ought to give Miss Shao Yin

553
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:16,480
an explanation at least.

554
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,041
- Indeed.
- That's right.

555
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,801
Give her an explanation.

556
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,360
Move.

557
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:29,161
So many strange things happened today.

558
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:31,881
First, he won the recital, but he
won't share the night with Miss Shao Yin.

559
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,521
And now, this?

560
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,881
I often see wives coming here
to fetch their husbands,

561
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,360
but it's my first time seeing a man come

562
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,801
to get another man.

563
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:41,881
Don't tell me...

564
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,641
Since he has left,

565
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:45,641
let's call it a night.

566
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,080
Miss Shao Yin.

567
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:48,801
Miss Shao Yin.

568
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:51,641
Let's leave.

569
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:52,881
Your Highness!

570
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:53,281
Black Foxy.

571
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:54,360
Your Highness!

572
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,761
Black Foxy, listen to me!

573
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,320
Your Highness!

574
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:57,281
Qiwu!

575
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,681
Your Highness,
if you have to punish someone,

576
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:59,441
punish me!

577
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:00,801
Miss!

578
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,320
You're too concerned.

579
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,240
His Highness would not
make things difficult for Miss Fengxi.

580
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,161
Let us return to our residence.

581
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,320
Black Foxy, hear me out.

582
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,240
You have to let me explain!

583
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:11,480
I know I was at fault.

584
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,561
I shouldn't have dressed up as a man

585
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:14,480
and gone out.

586
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,881
It's not about that.

587
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:16,921
I know.

588
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:18,441
I shouldn't have brought Qiwu along.

589
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:22,761
That's not it either.

590
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:25,401
I got it.

591
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,240
It's because I didn't
show up on time, right?

592
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:29,960
That is my mistake,

593
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,480
but...

594
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,441
(I am angry because
you did not take my words to heart.)

595
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:42,921
Don't stay mad.

596
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:44,801
Let's have a drink.

597
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,120
What has gotten into you, Black Foxy?

598
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:01,041
I've already waited for so long.

599
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,240
Why would I mind waiting longer?

600
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,200
What was that?

601
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,441
Speak louder.

602
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
I waited a long time in the mountains

603
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:13,480
to hunt a grizzly bear.

604
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh, I wondered what was bothering you.

605
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,200
You need techniques
when it comes to hunting bears.

606
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,561
For instance,

607
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:22,240
a bear runs by in a swish before you.

608
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,200
- I'm talking about you!
- You need to pull...

609
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,281
Not about a bear!

610
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,761
You're the one who brought up the bear.

611
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm giving you ideas here.

612
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:29,600
Didn't I tell you

613
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
the mastermind

614
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,480
might be targeting the Sacred Jade Moon?

615
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,200
They might be lurking in the dark,
waiting to ambush us.

616
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,881
But you still went out
without a second thought.

617
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,000
What if something happens to you?

618
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
The brothel is messy
and filled with all sorts of characters.

619
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,921
Aren't you afraid
of running into danger?

620
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,041
Do you pay attention

621
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:43,480
to the things I say?

622
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,681
You yelled at me.

623
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,480
- I...
- Did you just yell at me?

624
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:02,840
Even if I did something wrong,

625
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,161
how could you raise your voice to me?

626
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,521
I...

627
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:07,161
Have you ever considered my pride?

628
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:08,441
You didn't.

629
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,801
I did feel a little guilty.

630
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:11,881
But I've lost all sense of guilt

631
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:13,521
after what you did!

632
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,921
Reflect on yourself properly.

633
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,200
No...

634
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:20,641
Now, do you know what you did wrong?

635
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,881
They held hands! Hurry!

636
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,761
Launch the fireworks!

637
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:26,480
You're sly.

638
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,681
I almost fell for it.

639
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,801
- I...
- You...

647
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:06,480
This isn't some gentleman's attempt

648
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:07,801
to confess, right?

649
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,561
This trope you see in novels

650
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:11,801
is overused.

651
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,761
It won't work.

652
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:15,561
Not a chance.

653
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,641
So cliched.

654
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,360
Leave!

655
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:21,720
Don't bother me!

656
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:53,441
Your Highness.

657
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:55,360
These

658
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:57,720
are all the novels
I've accumulated over the years.

659
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,801
Please handle them with care.

660
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:00,480
Got it.

661
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,521
I see you read all kinds of stories.

662
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:09,881
(The Golden Lotus)
This Golden Lotus...

663
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,761
That isn't appropriate, Your Highness.

664
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:13,720
It's not suitable.

665
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,600
Why do you need these books?

666
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,041
She thought the fireworks were cliche.

667
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,441
I'm trying to find inspiration

668
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:25,641
from these stories.

669
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:27,240
Haven't they always said

670
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:30,281
that one would come to grasp
the meaning the more they read?

671
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,240
I thought Your Highness gave up.

672
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,200
Is that the type of man I am?

673
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
Your Highness,
you're sincere in your pursuit.

674
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,881
I'm sure your confession

675
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,161
will succeed this time.

676
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,161
Miss Fengxi,

677
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,041
I've just about taken all your pieces.

678
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,960
Are you sure you want to carry on?

679
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:06,120
Why not just tell me

680
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,360
what's on your mind?

681
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,200
Qiwu.

682
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:13,840
I went back and thought about

683
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,441
what happened that night.

684
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,441
Did Black Foxy prepare those fireworks?

685
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,761
You finally realized.

686
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:25,681
So...

687
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
He wanted to...

688
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,960
If my guess is right,

689
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:32,240
His Highness

690
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,080
intended to express his feelings
for you that day.

691
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,000
This trope you see in novels

692
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,161
is overused.

693
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,240
It won't work.

694
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,240
Not a chance.

695
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:45,320
So cliched.

696
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:51,441
But...

697
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,960
But?

698
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,840
Do you not like him?

699
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,120
I didn't say that.

700
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,200
But he has

701
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
a lot of flaws.

702
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,720
For example,

703
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,801
he...

704
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:04,881
is calculative.

705
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,000
He needs to ponder over everything
before he does something.

706
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:08,441
Also,

707
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,960
he is overbearing.

708
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,561
He needs to be in control
of everything at all times.

709
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,480
He is cold and distant as well.

710
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,960
He behaves as if everyone owes him.

711
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:20,801
In short, he is...

712
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:23,080
one of a kind

713
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:25,200
in this world.

714
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,240
Why do you chuckle?

715
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,561
Am I wrong?

716
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,761
Do you know

717
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:37,681
your eyes were filled with glee

718
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,480
when you spoke of his flaws?

719
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,480
People like to gaze at the stars

720
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,600
when the night is dark.

721
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,360
You look at the stars

722
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:56,360
not only because they glow,

723
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:58,441
but also because

724
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:00,560
you can never see them clearly.

725
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,161
I know.

726
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,040
I understand.

727
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:23,520
I am aware of my own feelings.

728
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,560
But these things

729
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:28,560
are all about timing.

730
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,080
Besides, last night, he didn't...

731
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:35,201
Your heart has been swayed.

732
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:37,881
Do you remember

733
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:38,961
how we went out together

734
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:39,961
on the day of the first snow,

735
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,441
and His Highness looked for you all day?

736
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,721
He only found out

737
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,280
you had gone out with me later on.

738
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,520
I've already waited for so long.

739
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,481
Why would I mind waiting longer?

740
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,201
I waited a long time in the mountains

741
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,520
to hunt a grizzly bear.

742
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:01,560
You're the bear.

743
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,280
What did you say?

744
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:05,800
Nothing.

745
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:11,040
Well, I can't exactly
bring it up first, right?

746
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,241
Let me ask you this then.

747
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,481
What if His Highness

748
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,641
expresses his feelings again?

749
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:50,921
Zhong Li,

750
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:52,280
go and tell Bai Fengxi

751
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:53,481
that I would like to ask her to go out

752
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,201
for the Lantern Festival with me.

753
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,280
Yes, Your Highness.

754
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:08,825
(Chancellor Ren's Residence, Yongzhou)

755
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,001
Sir, Miss Huan is asking to see you.

756
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:13,881
Huan?

757
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:15,881
Let her in.

758
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,840
Yes, Sir.

759
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:25,441
Official Ren.

760
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:27,280
I have something to ask of you.

761
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:29,441
Huan,

762
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:31,040
what are you doing?

763
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:32,681
Get up.

764
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,881
Did something happen to His Highness?

765
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,641
Recently, I learned that Miss Fengxi

766
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:45,001
was a skilled martial artist,

767
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,241
and His Highness has known her
for many years now.

768
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
She will probably join

769
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,520
His Highness' household soon.

770
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,520
I know His Highness has fallen for her,

771
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,161
but she has already
distracted His Highness

772
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:55,881
and caused him to lose his focus
before she married him.

773
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:58,401
His Highness has lost
all calmness and composure.

774
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,161
If she does marry...

775
00:34:59,161 --> 00:34:59,520
Enough.

776
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
His Highness' affairs

777
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,721
are not something a court lady like you

778
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:03,520
can speculate about.

779
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:06,641
The late Queen told me to take good care

780
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,721
of His Highness before she passed away.

781
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,320
I dare not go against her wishes.

782
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:13,401
You think too much.

783
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:15,280
A royal decree is needed

784
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,201
for His Highness
to take her as his wife.

785
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,961
It's not something His Highness
can decide on his own either.

786
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:22,040
But the entire residence now knows

787
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,641
that His Highness wishes to marry
a woman of the martial arts world.

788
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:26,721
I've been serving His Highness
since he was young.

789
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:27,961
I know him the best.

790
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,280
If His Highness decides
that she is the one for him,

791
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:31,760
he will marry her

792
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,241
no matter what stands in his way.

793
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:39,040
That is why

794
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,681
I ask that you go to her residence

795
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,320
and meet with her master in private.

796
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,641
Dissuade her from doing so.

797
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,961
If we take drastic measures
to deal with this problem,

798
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,840
the fire in His Highness

799
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,401
will be extinguished someday.

800
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:51,441
No.

801
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:54,040
I can't do such a thing
behind His Highness' back.

802
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,201
Just earlier,

803
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:58,520
I've already sent
a formal request for a visit

804
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,520
to Bai Jiande under your name.

805
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,241
He is probably

806
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:04,520
waiting for you
at the Pagoda Tree Estate now.

807
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,401
How dare you!

808
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,161
You are reckless and insolent!

809
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,441
I am at fault.

810
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:12,360
However,

811
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,441
you were there

812
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:15,481
when the late Queen said her dying wishes.

813
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,040
I would do anything

814
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:18,721
for His Highness.

815
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,241
But what about you?
Would you do the same?

816
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,881
A loyal subject

817
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:25,040
is one who dares to criticize
and advise their masters

818
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:26,681
even if it upsets them, right?

819
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:45,760
Greetings, Chancellor Ren.

820
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:47,921
Greetings, Master Bai.

821
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:50,001
I'm sorry I didn't welcome you earlier.

822
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,721
Please excuse me, Chancellor Ren.

823
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,760
I've heard that the Tianshuang Sect

824
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,721
is the leader of the righteous sects.

825
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,721
You've given His Highness

826
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,840
a lot of help as well.

827
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Yet, I only came to see you today.

828
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:04,641
I should be the one
asking for forgiveness, Master Bai.

829
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,040
You're too polite, Chancellor Ren.

830
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,840
Please have a seat.

831
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,681
What brings you here today,

832
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,040
Chancellor Ren?

833
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,681
To tell you honestly,

834
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:21,001
I came

835
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,921
to discuss the matter of Miss Fengxi.

836
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Xi?

837
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:29,760
I've heard of the matter

838
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,280
between His Highness and Miss Fengxi.

839
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,040
The Tianshuang Sect may be renowned,

840
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,001
but it is still a sect
of the martial arts world.

841
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,280
It would be difficult for Miss Fengxi

842
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
to marry His Highness.

843
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:43,161
Moreover,

844
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,360
I heard she is used

845
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,441
