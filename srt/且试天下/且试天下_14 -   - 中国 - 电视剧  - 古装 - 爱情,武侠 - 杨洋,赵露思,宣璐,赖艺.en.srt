I'm almost well.

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,720
I know.

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,599
When the curfew is lifted,

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,199
we'll meet up with Master on Mount Wu.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,279
We've investigated Gu Yu's doing.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,120
It's not related
to the Tianshuang Sect.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,360
Dismissed.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,400
Yes.

28
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,000
Dismissed.

29
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,959
Thank you.

30
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,319
We know the truth now.

31
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,559
The murderer who took
Gu Yu's life in prison

32
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,119
has been found.

33
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,479
Thank you.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,440
May we retrieve
my martial brother's remains?

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,039
Gu Yu murdered an official.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,199
The Ministry of Justice buried
his body in the mass grave.

37
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,080
Understood.

38
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,600
Prince Yongping awaits you
at the Lanyun Restaurant.

39
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,639
Prince Yongping?

40
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,639
I need to go out.

41
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,800
Pack your things.

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
We'll go to Mount Wu tomorrow.

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,679
We're all set.

44
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,360
Just how big

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,119
is your stomach anyway?

46
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,839
Your cooking

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,639
has improved significantly.

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,880
Not bad.

49
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,080
It's delicious.

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,520
Is it all right for you

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,119
to be a cook here?

52
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,160
What if people found out?

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,440
The Lanyun Restaurant

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,199
is my asset.

55
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,759
Not bad, Black Foxy.

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
The Lanyun Restaurant...

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,759
"Lan" is taken from your name, Lanxi.

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,119
As for "yun"...

59
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,720
From the name "Xiyun"?

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,039
Indeed.

61
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:22,839
I'm surprised.

62
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,479
Your love for Princess Xiyun

63
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,720
is deeper than I have expected.

64
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,279
You've never met her,

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,600
but you're so in love with her.

66
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,520
What's got into you anyway?

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
We had met in the past,

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,679
but we were still children.

69
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,199
Even if we met now,

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm afraid I wouldn't recognize her.

71
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,639
You met her?

72
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,919
Where?

73
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
During a Six States banquet.

74
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,662
(Imperial City of Dadong Empire)

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,160
(Mother.)

76
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,839
(You said you'd take me to
the Seven Founders)

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,399
(and pay respect
to the late Emperor Weilie.)

78
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,440
(We never had the chance.)

79
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,960
(But today, I came by myself.)

80
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,279
(Consider the wish fulfilled.)

81
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,197
(Memorial Tablet of
Emperor Weilie of Dadong)

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,119
(Teenage Feng Lanxi)
If Emperor Weilie was alive,

83
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,359
what would he think about
the present Imperial Family

84
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,040
and the Six States?

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,799
But feat not.

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,799
The blood of the imperial family
flows in me.

87
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,320
(Emperor Weilie of Dadong)
If the world falls apart,

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,880
I shall rebuild it with my own strength.

89
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,399
Watch over me, Emperor Weilie.

90
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,816
(Blessed by Heaven)

91
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,920
Who are you?

92
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,839
(Teenage Feng Xiyun)

93
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,839
I'm the First Prince's reading partner.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,880
Who are you?

95
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,480
You are not worthy of knowing my name.

96
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,359
Your Highness.

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
This is forbidden ground.

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,679
Why would a reading partner be here?

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,920
His Highness told me

100
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,119
the pictures of
the Founding Fathers are here.

101
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,559
I came here out of curiosity.

102
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,600
Your Highness claims
this is forbidden ground,

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,119
but why are you here?

104
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,279
I was just as curious
about the pictures.

105
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,559
If you ratted me out,

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,799
I'd have my brother behead you!

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Since we both sneaked in
to see the pictures,

108
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,239
perhaps we should
keep each other's secret.

109
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,559
Deal.

110
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,519
Deal.

111
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:38,275
(Lord Fengsu)

112
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,200
The only female general
in the Six States,

113
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,760
the founder of Qingzhou, Lord Feng.

114
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:42,394
(Lord Fengsu)

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,880
History records say
she is a person of poise.

116
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,609
Some say she was the greatest beauty

117
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,880
(Lord Fengsu)
the world has ever seen.

118
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,200
You're slightly

119
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,720
inferior to her.

120
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,279
She was the greatest beauty.

121
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
I'm only slightly inferior,

122
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,640
so I was the second greatest beauty.

123
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,640
Now that she is gone,

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm taking her place
as the greatest beauty.

125
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,160
My name is Fengxi.

126
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,200
What is your name?

127
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,359
Fengxi?

128
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,079
My name is Xiyun.

129
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,679
I've seen the pictures.
I should get going.

130
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,394
(Lord Fengsu)

131
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,320
Since that day,

132
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,119
I've never seen her again.

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,399
The Lanyun Restaurant

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,799
is a memento of my spirit
in my younger days

135
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,600
and my great ambition.

136
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
You're eating too fast.

137
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,160
You're a weird person.

138
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:46,480
You treat me to a meal,

139
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,119
so why do you even care?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,799
May I have the ladle?

141
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:07,920
Thanks.

142
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,279
Thank you for today.

143
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,359
Don't mention it.

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
Everything you did today

145
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,640
was to give me closure.

146
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,160
The scandal may have been solved,

147
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,720
but everyone wants me to
set aside my frustration

148
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
for the greater good.

149
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,079
Only you

150
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,600
truly care about my thoughts.

151
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,519
You didn't tell me

152
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,640
who you truly were.

153
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,040
You feared your status

154
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,000
would get in the way of our friendship.

155
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:53,119
You also knew how much
I hated the court

156
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,480
and preferred to live freely
as a vagabond.

157
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,200
I thought you were too calculating.

158
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,679
But after these days,

159
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,679
it seems that was necessary.

160
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,079
Given the power struggle,

161
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,200
you're not the kind

162
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,640
that would settle with only
having Yongzhou.

163
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,679
When that day comes,

164
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,000
I wonder if we could
still remain friends.

165
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,239
You're different.

166
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,480
You still have your status.

167
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,679
If you somehow lost everything

168
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,040
except for your identity as Black Foxy,

169
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,479
I wouldn't mind

170
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,280
having a fight with you

171
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
over the title of Bai-Hei Fengxi.

172
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,719
Langhua has recovered.

173
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,239
I promised her

174
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,000
we'd go to Mount Wu tomorrow.

175
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,760
Take care.

176
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,000
Take care.

177
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,119
So long.

178
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,599
(I belong in the court,)

179
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,559
(you should roam the land freely.)

180
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,200
(It's best you don't get involved
in the power struggle.)

181
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,880
(Black Foxy,)

182
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,760
(wouldn't it be great if you were
just Hei Fengxi of the martial arts world?)

183
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,719
Will you miss this place?

184
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Why would I?

185
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,119
I can come here at any time.

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,239
What about him?

187
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,599
We are on different paths.

188
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,840
It's best to say our goodbyes

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,359
than suffer the pain of separating.

190
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,599
This is for the best.

191
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:26,840
Does it not hurt

192
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,520
when you're apart?

193
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,159
It won't as long as I let go.

194
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:59,399
♪Like the dissipating fog,
you become clearer♪

195
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,767
♪Like the hawk that soars freely,
you reject the shackles♪

196
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,080
Your Highness.

197
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,880
Miss Feng is leaving today.

198
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,520
Why aren't you seeing her off?

199
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,840
I've been involved
in power struggles for so long.

200
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,840
I envy her

201
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,559
for her unshackled life.

202
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,719
The path I take

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,599
will be one with bloodshed.

204
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,607
♪Wind is just the outline of the cloud♪

205
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,760
We don't belong on the same path,

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
therefore, I should let go.

207
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,200
Seeing her off

208
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,799
will give birth to yearning.

209
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,960
Knowing she is pursuing
a life she desires

210
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
is more than enough for me.

211
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:47,274
♪A full moon will be more intertwined♪

212
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:51,594
♪If some things cannot be taken apart♪

213
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:56,321
♪Then let's face
the uncertainty together♪

214
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,520
I left the capital as a child

215
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,599
and lived on the frontier
with my father.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,719
After I returned,

217
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,400
I got my hands full
with family affairs.

218
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,880
Changling is so beautiful,

219
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,840
but I've never been here.

220
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,440
May I know why Your Highness

221
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,760
has brought me here?

222
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,080
Minister Feng, what do you think

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,119
of this land?

224
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,200
It's safe to say
the land is picturesque.

225
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,479
I've brought you here

226
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
to tell you

227
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,599
this is what I'm after.

228
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,359
You want more than just
the rule over Yongzhou,

229
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,960
but the entire Central Plain.

230
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,039
I pledge fealty to you

231
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
on behalf of the Feng family.

232
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,280
Since you know my ambition,

233
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,239
you should know that

234
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,840
the one thing

235
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,719
I don't need is romance.

236
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,159
I don't want you to waste
your precious youth on me.

237
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,280
Can there never be

238
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,880
more than ranks and duties between us?

239
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,280
If you make a great contribution

240
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,640
and improve people's lives,

241
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
your deeds will be remembered

242
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,760
for ages to come.

243
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,559
Such fame is more than
what a prince's wife can have.

244
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,919
I have no desire for a relationship.

245
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,840
I can't let leave
your feelings unanswered.

246
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,799
I consider you my trusted officer.

247
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,280
I hope that

248
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,559
you stay loyal to me

249
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,119
as my aide.

250
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,440
I'll gladly work with you

251
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,320
to protect the people of Yongzhou.

252
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,200
Can Your Highness

253
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,679
really treat everyone equally?

254
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,239
Are you still

255
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,679
holding a grudge against me
over the royal examination?

256
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,359
I wouldn't.

257
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,679
Have a look.

258
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,200
Xi,

259
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:24,440
you've always had a brilliant mind.

260
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,760
You should know

261
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,119
the Six States race
to seize the throne.

262
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,520
Our priority

263
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,080
is not to be competitive.

264
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,400
This memo

265
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,719
is a secret message for me,
sent by the Minister of War,

266
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,200
Yuan Boyan.

267
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,200
To bolster our military reserve,

268
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,599
I ordered Yuan Boyan

269
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,119
to join hands with five generals

270
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,200
to secretly muster more troops.

271
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,479
We ran into some issues
with the horse supplies.

272
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,239
The number of horses we have

273
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,400
is 30 percent below what we need.

274
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,840
How much do you know

275
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,559
about military horses?

276
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,200
There are many farmlands in Yongzhou,

277
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,640
but most of the horses

278
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,320
are used for farming.

279
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,840
They are not meant for war.

280
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,239
For many years

281
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,559
the military horses of Yongzhou

282
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,840
were purchased

283
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,760
from the north by the Ministry of War.

284
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,159
Indeed.

285
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,320
The military horse reserve

286
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,239
will directly determine
Yongzhou's military strength.

287
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,880
The fate of the nation is at stake.

288
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,359
Each year, we have an ample budget

289
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,200
to purchase horses.

290
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
However,

291
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,479
someone is filling their pockets

292
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
by purchasing horses that are cheaper

293
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,919
and passing them off as finer horses.

294
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,799
This action has undermined our army.

295
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,159
With the intervention of Beizhou,

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,039
our horse trade

297
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,000
was broken off.

298
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,479
At the last court meeting,

299
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,559
you suggested that we should
secure more purchasing routes

300
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,280
by trading with merchants.

301
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,760
I want to know the details.

302
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,919
The Ministry of War has been

303
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,440
in charge of the horse trading.

304
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,080
The ranchers from the north

305
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,359
have refused to trade with us

306
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,719
because the price we offer was too low.

307
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:05,880
However,

308
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,640
they are not the only people
we can trade with.

309
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,039
The eastern frontier
produces fine horses

310
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,640
that are on par
with those from the north.

311
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,679
Many merchants in the city

312
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,679
use horses from the eastern frontier

313
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,200
to transport cargo.

314
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,880
I think

315
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
we should use

316
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,440
the horses from
the east as an alternative.

317
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,080
Xi,

318
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,880
can you take care of this matter?

319
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,520
I will try my best.

320
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,679
Very well.

321
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,320
I will give out the order tomorrow.

322
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,000
You will be in charge of
procuring the horses.

323
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,880
Yes.

324
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,840
Your Highness,

325
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,880
this is a great opportunity.

326
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:44,880
Should you succeed,

327
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:47,039
you are one step closer to becoming

328
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,559
the heir of the Lord.

329
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,679
The Vice Minister Wang Minghai of War
was charged with that duty.

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,960
He used his influence

331
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,719
as Minister Wang's brother

332
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,039
to monopolize the trading.

333
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,640
Not even Minister Yuan Boyan

334
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,599
could stop him.

335
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,559
Even if you procure horses

336
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,039
by opening

337
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,680
a trade route to the south,

338
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,119
Wang Minghai could still
tamper with the inventory.

339
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,520
That's what my father wants me
to take care of.

340
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,800
The purchase of the horses
was just an excuse.

341
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,560
Father wants me to use
this as an opportunity

342
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,319
to stop Minister Wang
and limit his influence.

343
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,760
Therefore,

344
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,719
we must fight on two fronts.

345
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,319
Chuanyun and Chuanyu,

346
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,079
inform the House of Jade

347
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,160
to muster the merchant caravans

348
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,520
and head to the eastern frontier.

349
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,880
You two are going with them.

350
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,439
Inform me immediately
if you run into any trouble.

351
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,040
Yes.

352
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,439
Minister Feng,

353
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,400
I will need your help as well.

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,239
Before they make it back,

355
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:46,280
find the evidence of Wang Minghai
embezzling the national funding.

356
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,760
Understood.

357
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,959
Minister Wang, have you come here

358
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,880
because of the horse trade?

359
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,119
Yes.

360
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,239
Your Highness, as you know,

361
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,680
my worthless brother has been

362
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,560
in charge of the matter.

363
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,479
But just yesterday,
His Lordship decided

364
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,040
to charge Prince Yongping
with the task.

365
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,079
I fear

366
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,479
he may use this
as an opportunity against me.

367
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,239
I came to discuss the matter.

368
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,560
If your brother
has done nothing illicit,

369
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,520
why would he be worried
about Prince Yongping?

370
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,839
As you know,

371
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,079
the horse trade was very lucrative.

372
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,800
If it wasn't for His Lordship's
sudden plan to increase

373
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,959
our military strength,

374
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,280
we would have had

375
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,479
enough horses.

376
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,319
"Would have?"

377
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,800
If His Lordship hadn't
sent Yuan Boyan to check the horses,

378
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,959
he would never know we were still
lacking 30 percent horses.

379
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,520
Do you have any idea
how furious His Lordship was

380
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,400
when he found out?

381
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,439
Your brother was smart enough

382
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,199
to put the blame on a supervisor
managing the ranch

383
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,839
and accuse the person
of selling off the horses.

384
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,439
And he managed to save his neck.

385
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,119
Prince Yongping is smarter
than to believe that.

386
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,359
Do you think His Lordship
sends him to get the horses?

387
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,359
He is using this chance

388
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
to bring you down.

389
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,079
The fate of the nation is at stake.

390
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,880
I can't offer you any help.

391
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,160
Your Highness,

392
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,199
I'm not the target,

393
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,199
we are.

394
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,760
Eighty percent of the money
my brother embezzled

395
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,400
has been sent over to Prince Ju.

396
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,839
If my brother was found guilty,

397
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,400
Prince Ju would be in danger as well.

398
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,439
Are you threatening me?

399
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,439
I wouldn't dare.

400
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,680
I merely hope

401
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,560
to overcome this crisis
with you and Prince Ju.

402
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,040
What do you want?

403
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,400
Those missing horses

404
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
were all secretly sold.

405
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:04,280
I should investigate where they went.

406
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,599
An investigation?

407
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,880
Are you going to investigate
the whole thing?

408
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
Indeed.

409
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,040
Therefore,

410
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,760
I will require your help.

411
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,119
(Feng Lanxi,)

412
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,040
(I have another surprise for you)

413
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,959
(on top of the horse trade.)

414
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,959
(You will be cornered this time.)

415
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,119
(Let's see how you overcome
this predicament.)

416
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,199
Brother,

417
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,199
did the Queen

418
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,119
agree to help us?

419
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,560
Of course.

420
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,599
I had to clean up

421
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,800
after the mess you caused.

422
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,680
No, Brother.

423
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,319
I didn't expect His Lordship

424
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:57,359
would check the inventory.

425
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,839
Order your merchants to

426
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,439
head to the eastern frontier

427
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,920
and purchase each horse
with ten silver leaves.

428
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,680
Raise the price.

429
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,640
Ten silver leaves?

430
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,640
But,

431
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,760
that's too much!

432
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,599
To substantially raise the price,

433
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,000
we will need to purchase
over a hundred horses.

434
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,520
That's thousands of silver leaves.

435
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,560
Does it matter?

436
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,160
Haven't you

437
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,640
profited enough

438
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,560
from the horses?

439
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,359
You're complaining over
such a small amount.

440
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,199
Do you have any idea

441
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
what's more important?

442
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,680
Is it your life or the money?

443
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:34,880
Brother,

444
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,359
calm down.

445
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,640
I'll get it done.

446
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,000
Mother.

447
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,199
I've learned from my mistake.

448
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,160
How dare you!

449
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,439
You embezzled from the military horse.

450
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,599
I shall give you a lesson

451
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,319
so you won't repeat this mistake.

452
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,319
Beat him up.

453
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,199
Your Highness...

454
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:03,800
Do it.

455
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,359
That hurts!

456
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,439
Hit harder.

457
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,040
Mother!

458
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,079
Your Highness,

459
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,520
my apologies.

460
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,560
Enough. Enough.

461
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,599
Thank you, Mother.

462
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,760
Leave tonight

463
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,880
for the eastern frontier.

464
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,040
Go to your Uncle Ning.

465
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,520
Borrow a thousand horses from him.

466
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,177
(To Marquis Xun'an)

467
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,920
Borrow?

468
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,439
I started investigating

469
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,359
Wang Minghai's misconduct.

470
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,920
Too many are involved
in the horse trading.

471
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,119
I'm afraid we won't find

472
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,359
any useful clues for now.

473
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,439
If Wang Minghai is
embezzling the funding,

474
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,920
he will use some
businesses as his cover.

475
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,920
Investigate the merchants

476
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,040
for evidence.

477
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
A lot of people are involved.

478
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,079
Your Highness will

479
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,520
ruffle a lot of feathers with this.

480
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,800
That's what my father wants.

481
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,359
This is the only way

482
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,680
for him to gain from the in-fighting.

483
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,680
He wants to limit Minister Wang's power

484
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,040
and make the people lose faith in me.

485
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,160
A man in his position

486
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,280
won't settle with
bringing only one man down.

487
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,160
Understood.

488
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,040
By the way,

489
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,920
when I came,

490
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,199
I heard that Prince Ju
had left the city.

491
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,560
I heard it was

492
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,959
for a votive prayer.

493
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,319
It seems my brother

494
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,400
is part of it.

495
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,640
Very well.

496
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,839
Keep investigating Wang Minghai.

497
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,839
Yes.

498
00:23:56,466 --> 00:24:00,895
(Mount Wu)

499
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,280
Did you bring me to Mount Wu

500
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,079
so I could get

501
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,040
Old Taiyin's legacy for you?

502
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,520
The Sacred Jade Moon?

503
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,160
It was said that
the technique was divine.

504
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,479
Perhaps it could

505
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:24,160
lift your family's curse.

506
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,239
The curse has haunted us for a century.

507
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,800
It won't be lifted so easily.

508
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,040
I came

509
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,239
because many from the martial arts world
were stranded here.

510
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,119
I came to solve the mystery.

511
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,800
As for Old Taiyin's legacy,

512
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,920
it's best if I get it.

513
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,119
I wouldn't mind

514
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,479
if I don't.

515
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,599
Did you bring me here
to rescue lost souls?

516
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:45,640
Well?

517
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,319
Do you look down

518
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,800
on these people?

519
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,839
These people

520
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,119
are not trustworthy.

521
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,040
You are wrong.

522
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,400
The martial arts world and the court

523
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,880
have been inseparable.

524
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Many mighty

525
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:04,640
and unstoppable heroes

526
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
are from the martial arts world.

527
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,760
They may not be of help to you,

528
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,319
but you should be careful

529
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,439
if they come after you.

530
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,439
His Majesty gave you an order.

531
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,280
If you hope to unify the land,

532
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:19,640
you will need the support
from these heroes.

533
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,599
Now that we're here,

534
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,439
we'll follow your plan.

535
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,079
It's her.

536
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,560
Miss Fengxi.

537
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,839
Prince Huang and Mr. Yu.

538
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,000
Are you here

539
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
for Old Taiyin's legacy?

540
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,439
My Master is on Mount Wu.

541
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,599
We are here for him.

542
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,239
I see.

543
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,160
With your help, Miss Fengxi,

544
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,680
we can finally solve

545
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
the mystery of this mountain.

546
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,280
How much do you know
about the situation?

547
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,599
There were 30 heroes

548
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,239
who came to Mount Wu.

549
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
None of them has left.

550
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,920
But from what I've learned,

551
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:05,479
this mystery

552
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,160
is a trial given by Old Taiyin.

553
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,040
No one should die in the process.

554
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,880
When someone passes the trial,

555
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,920
the mystery will be solved.

556
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,599
Old Taiyin

557
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:16,920
wouldn't lie about it.

558
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,280
My father is safe,

559
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,959
right?

560
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,439
If Old Taiyin is overseeing them,

561
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,079
Master and the others will be safe.

562
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,640
Miss Fengxi,

563
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,520
we are entering the mountain

564
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,760
to rescue the others.

565
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,439
Will you join us?

566
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:30,959
Of course.

567
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:32,599
Langhua, Jiurong,

568
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,640
come with me.

569
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,000
Lu Shi, you and the rest will wait here.

570
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:38,959
Yes, Martial Sister.

571
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,319
Your Highness,

572
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,359
according to those at Mount Wu,

573
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,920
Miss Feng has entered the mountain.

574
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,199
Prince Huang Chao
from Jizhou is with her,

575
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,560
and so is Yu Wuyuan.

576
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,439
Understood.

577
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,719
Stop keeping me posted

578
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,400
about her.

579
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:12,560
Yes.

580
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,300
(Feng Chang's Residence, Yongzhou)

581
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,000
Your Highness.

582
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,640
Your Highness.

583
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:27,920
What is it, Uncle De?

584
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,560
Your Highness.

585
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,280
The Queen summons you

586
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,439
to her palace.

587
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,439
Your Highness.

588
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,280
Hurry.

589
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,280
Greetings, Mother.

590
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,239
May you live well and be blessed.

591
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,119
Greetings, Mother.

592
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,000
May you live well and be blessed.

593
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,520
Chang, get up.

594
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,119
I summoned you many times,

595
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,239
but you said you were sick.

596
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,000
Are you feeling better now?

597
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,560
Silly child.

598
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,319
Are you trying to spite me?

599
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,800
I wouldn't refuse to meet you, Mother.

600
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,079
You ignored me.

601
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,119
You left for the Buddhist prayer

602
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,719
but never wrote me

603
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,000
any letter.

604
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,319
Did you have a fight with Feng Ju

605
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,880
while I was away?

606
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,359
Unbelievable.

607
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,920
You're an adult.

608
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:51,959
You should be more patient
with your brother.

609
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,319
You sounded like
a child when you fought.

610
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,319
I bet

611
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,760
you were never sick.

612
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,640
You were sulking over

613
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,880
such a trivial matter

614
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,319
and refused to see me.

615
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,079
Silly child.

616
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,839
You are my son.

617
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,359
Why wouldn't I want to see you?

618
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,160
Speaking of that,

619
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,640
we are both just as stubborn.

620
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,959
You got upset and wouldn't visit me.

621
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,760
But I am a human being too.

622
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,560
I feel upset too.

623
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,560
It was wrong of me

624
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,199
to have made you worry.

625
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,319
Enough about that.

626
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm glad to know you're well.

627
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:32,880
I always care about
you and Feng Ju.

628
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,359
I should

629
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,520
find each of you a wife

630
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,760
to boss you around.

631
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,640
Perhaps your brother will
finally be more sensible

632
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,920
and stop fighting with you.

633
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,319
Look,

634
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,319
I prepared some presents for you.

635
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:48,839
Sit down.

636
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,239
Sit.

637
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,160
Tonic pills, snake jasmine,

638
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,719
and ginseng gifted by your father.

639
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,680
And these!

640
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:01,959
They are still warm.

641
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,359
Finish them before they get cold.

642
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,560
I know these are your favorite.

643
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:10,800
Here.

644
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:12,280
Here, try it out.

645
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,239
Mother.

646
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:31,880
I'm right here.

647
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,040
Do you like it?

648
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,319
It's delicious.

649
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,839
That settles the arrangement
for your marriage.

650
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:55,800
Tomorrow,

651
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,040
I will summon Duke Qi's
wife and daughter.

652
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,719
You shall see for yourself

653
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,719
if she is as beautiful as I describe.

654
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,520
Thank you, Mother.

655
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,079
What happened?

656
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,000
Judging by her tone,

657
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,239
she's picked a wife for you, Your Highness.

658
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:23,079
She lost to Lanxi during
the royal examination scandal.

659
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,760
Father has charged Lanxi
with the horse trading.

660
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,680
My beloved Mother

661
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,239
has lost her patience.

662
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,479
Duke Qi governs
the cities of Ming, Ping, and Yuan.

663
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,959
He and Lanxi never see eye to eye.

664
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,680
If I married his daughter,

665
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
Lanxi and I would become enemies.

666
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,920
If Lanxi and I tore each other apart,

667
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:45,000
Feng Ju would benefit from it the most.

668
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,599
How can she be so cruel?

669
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,839
Perhaps it's all a misunderstanding.

670
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
I think she is only doing so out of

671
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,599
her love for you.

672
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,040
Her love for me?

673
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,680
Why would

674
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,520
there be shrimp in
the buns she gave me?

675
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,359
That's because she doesn't remember

676
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,479
that I get rashes

677
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,160
from eating shrimp.

678
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,800
I've waited for 15 years.

679
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,239
That was all I got from her.

680
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,839
(Yongzhou Army Base)

681
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,400
Marquis Xun'an,

682
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,439
Prince Ju wants to see you.

683
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,920
(Marquis Xun'an, Feng Ning)
Let him in.

684
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
(Marquis Xun'an, Feng Ning)
Yes.

685
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,439
Greetings, Uncle Ning.

686
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:50,560
Ju.

687
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,719
What brings you here?

688
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:53,280
Uncle,

689
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,280
my mother sent me here
to borrow a thousand horses from you.

690
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,319
Horses?

691
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,560
I barely have enough here.

692
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,040
I can't lend you my horses.

693
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,839
This is her letter to you.

694
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,160
This should explain it.

695
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,119
Wait here.

696
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,560
My men will check the inventory.

697
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,000
Thank you, Uncle Ning.

698
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,280
Stop right there!

699
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,631
(Duke Qi's Daughter, Miss Qi Cheng)

700
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,680
You've shown me nothing

701
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,119
but a long face.

702
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,000
What is the meaning of this?

703
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,119
What do you mean?

704
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,640
Listen up.

705
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,319
The Queen requested

706
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,000
for my mother to marry me off to you.

707
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,880
Otherwise, I wouldn't marry
a servant's child.

708
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,079
I dare you to say that again.

709
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,560
What's wrong?

710
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,000
Are you going to hit me?

711
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,800
Let me make it clear for you.

712
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,959
My father says

713
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,280
you must

714
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,959
be my obedient husband.

715
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,800
Otherwise,

716
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,959
he will make sure the Minister of Rite

717
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,280
never lets you hold any title.

718
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,159
Stop right there!

719
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,879
Come back before
I tell the Queen about this!

720
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,439
Hey!

721
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,959
How was the conversation
with Duke Qi's daughter?

722
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,000
She seems very gentle and caring.

723
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,199
She will be a good wife.

724
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,040
Mother, do you think Duke Qi's daughter

725
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,439
is gentle and caring?

726
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,719
She is young. It's normal for her
to be a little temperamental.

727
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,159
Cheer her up.

728
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,080
More importantly,

729
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,600
she comes from a good family.

730
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,479
She is Duke Qi's only daughter.

731
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,000
Once you marry her,

732
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,320
the Qi family will support you.

733
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,439
According to her,

734
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,360
she wants me to obey her every order.

735
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,600
Then, perhaps her father

736
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,320
would let me hold a title.

737
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,560
This is insolence.

738
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,040
Duke Qi's spoiling has made her

739
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,639
so rude.

740
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,800
Don't worry.

741
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,600
I will tell her father about this.

742
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,120
But for a Prince like yourself,

743
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,439
having influential in-laws

744
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,040
will certainly give you an edge.

745
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,560
That is a fact.

746
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,919
That will put my mind to ease.

747
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,719
So,

748
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,159
I'll fix a date

749
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,840
for your wedding.

750
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:39,760
Mother,

751
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,080
I have only met her once.

752
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,919
I barely talked to her.

753
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,719
Don't you think

754
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,600
we need more time?

755
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,520
Don't take it out on me just because

756
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,320
Duke Qi's daughter scorned you.

757
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,159
Are you going

758
00:35:58,479 --> 00:35:59,439
to leave me here?

759
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,040
Chang...

760
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,280
After I came to the palace,

761
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,320
you never asked me

762
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,239
if I was actually

763
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,120
fond of her.

764
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,439
Your marriage

765
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,760
is to be decided by your parents.

766
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,040
You are royalty.

767
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,719
You don't get to choose
who you like or not.

768
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,280
Your father married Yige

769
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,399
despite the fact he was in love with me

770
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,479
at the time.

771
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:31,959
What about now?

772
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,399
Queen Yige passed away.

773
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
You are the Queen now!

774
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,639
I know you're an adult,

775
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,280
but don't you dare challenge me!

776
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,639
Your marriage with Qi Cheng is decided.

777
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,199
If you disagree with it,

778
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,280
our bond as mother and son

779
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,239
ends today.

780
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,080
It's up to you.

781
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,000
You're nothing but a torment,

782
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,560
a spawn that gets on my nerve.

783
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,919
Your Highness.

784
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,600
News came from the palace.

785
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,560
Prince Chang visited the Queen.

786
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
The Queen summoned

787
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,439
Qi Cheng, Duke Qi's daughter
to her palace.

788
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,879
She means to arrange
a marriage for them.

789
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,800
(Queen Baili knows
Feng Chang and I are close.)

790
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
(She plans)

791
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,639
(to rob me of my remaining sibling.)

792
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,760
(The horse trading)

793
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,040
(made her worry.)

794
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,479
(She is desperate)

795
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,280
(to bring me down.)

796
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,800
(She would even use
my brother against me.)

797
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,280
Your Highness.

798
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,639
When Prince Chang left the palace,

799
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,439
he seems angry.

800
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,120
She should never think about

801
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,159
using my brother.

802
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:33,637
(Mount Wu)

803
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:14,959
Watch out for the leaves!

804
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,080
Stay still.

805
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:10,439
Our movements stir the air.

806
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,479
The bigger the movement is,

807
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,280
the stronger the leaves are.

808
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,760
Martial Sister!

809
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,560
Langhua!

810
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,199
Langhua!

811
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,879
They are both safe.

812
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:05,479
You must press on.

813
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,000
Langhua!

814
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:15,439
Let go!

815
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,679
Let go before we both fall down!

816
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,399
Never!

817
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:06,719
Are you all right?

818
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,199
Were you out of your mind?

819
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,560
Why didn't you let go?

820
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,080
I don't want you to...

821
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,000
I would rather

822
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,679
die by your side.

823
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,719
Fool.

824
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,000
What is it?

825
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,959
