the renowned Bai Fengxi

25
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:56,959
dislike bitter medicine?

(In Memory of Yan Yingzhou)

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
I'll definitely keep

28
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:31,160
the promise that I made to you.

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,440
So rest assured.

30
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:37,310
(In Memory of Yan Yingzhou)

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,559
Don't tell me

32
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,559
you're going to build a hut
and guard the tomb here.

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,320
Anything I want to do

34
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,360
doesn't concern you.

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Stop pretending to be nice.

36
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,279
Did you think

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,720
no one knew what you did in Mount Xuan?

38
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,960
Hawks drove the foes away.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
Black Foxy was indeed behind this.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,600
Indeed,

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,199
I can hide anything

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,559
from the world.

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Yet, I couldn't hide anything from you.

44
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,440
You may be a known hero.

45
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,919
But I know you'll never do anything

46
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,960
that does you no good.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,440
You're realistic and selfish.

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,800
I just didn't expect it.

49
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,240
You had the chance
to save Yan Yingzhou.

50
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:25,520
Yet, you watched

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,440
him fight hard to his death.

52
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,119
I have my reasons for my actions.

53
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,679
The poison in your body
has been suppressed for now.

54
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,119
If you want to remove it completely,

55
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,960
you need to head to the Han's Residence

56
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,000
for Buddha Pill.

57
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,880
Thank you for reminding me.

58
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,679
We shall part here.

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
(You'll understand)

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,679
(that it was Lord of Jizhou's greed)

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
(that sent General Liefeng
to his death.)

62
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,440
Bai Fengxi,
how dare you show yourself here.

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,200
We're going to avenge
the Han family today.

64
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
The Han family?

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,239
What happened to the Han family?

66
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,880
You killed everyone
in the Han's Residence

67
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,320
and burned down their home.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yet, you're feigning ignorance.

69
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,399
The Han family has been massacred?

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
You wanted to snatch medicines
during Mr. Han's birthday feast.

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,679
He refused to give you any.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
So you resented him.

73
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,799
Bai Fengxi, what else can you say?

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
All of you sure are good at talking.

75
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,559
You could just

76
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,760
say a few things
and pin this crime on me.

77
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,040
Who else would do it if not you?

78
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,760
Mr. Han is an amiable man.

79
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,320
You were the only one
who had a beef with him,

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
and the rest were all his friends.

81
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,519
That's right.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,519
I take responsibility for my actions.

83
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,320
But I'm not involved in this matter.

84
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,880
Do you think you're innocent
because you say so?

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,880
Bai Fengxi,

86
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,839
do you really think nothing
of Beizhou's martial artists?

87
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,839
Today, we'll avenge the Han family!

88
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
She has been

89
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,000
with me these few days.

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,399
-Who are you?
-Who's there?

91
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
Mr. Fengxi?

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,160
Mr. Fengxi?

93
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,200
What is he doing here?

94
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,440
I know you won't believe me.

95
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,200
But give me a few days.

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I'll get to the bottom of this

97
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,200
to prove my innocence.

98
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,559
All right.

99
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,440
For Mr. Fengxi,

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,679
we'll spare you this time.

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
Bai Fengxi,
I hope you'll keep your word.

102
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:06,880
Leave.

103
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,160
Why did you follow me?

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,920
There is something strange
about the massacre of the Han family.

105
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,079
I just want to figure it out.

106
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,640
(How could this happen
to the Han family?)

107
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,279
(I must check it out.)

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,519
Sir,

109
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,359
the fire in the backyard
has been put out.

110
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,359
I want to know why this happened too.

111
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,359
Zhong Li. Chuanyu.

112
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,600
-Yes, sir.
-Stay here.

113
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,600
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,559
There's not one survivor.

115
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,119
Judging from the condition
of the bodies,

116
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,519
the attackers' motive is clear.

117
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,239
They wanted to annihilate
the Han family.

118
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,679
They were attacked with curved blades.

119
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Soultaker Sect is behind this.

120
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Soultaker Sect?

121
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,040
The reason Soultaker Sect wants
to annihilate the Han family

122
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,720
must be the medicines.

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
They were killed
because they have something valuable.

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
It is really the most outrageous thing
in the world.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,839
It's not just for the medicines.

126
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,799
There are the Han family's
medicinal prescriptions too.

127
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,839
Anyone who possesses
the Han family's prescriptions

128
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,040
and refines them into pills

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,920
will be a great help

130
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,399
to war or the martial arts world.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,119
There are 55 people

132
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,119
in the Han family, as far as I know.

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,959
But we were missing one person.

134
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,320
By the way,

135
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,200
did you see a child's body?

136
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,079
The Young Master of Han family, Han Pu?

137
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,079
No.

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,239
Han Xuanling must have hidden him away.

139
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,799
Let's search for him.

140
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,119
Don't come any closer!

141
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,320
Don't worry. We won't hurt you.

142
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,039
Go away!

143
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,479
These are the prescriptions
they were looking for.

144
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
As expected from Black Foxy.

145
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,719
Did you come

146
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,000
for these prescriptions that day too?

147
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,719
There is one option

148
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,239
if you want to find clues
about the Soultaker Sect.

149
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,080
If you spread out the news

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,280
that you've found

151
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,919
Han Pu and the prescriptions,

152
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,119
they'd come looking for you

153
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,919
instead of you looking for them.

154
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,119
I know.

155
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,679
But if you do this,

156
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,119
you'll put yourself in danger.

157
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:26,880
You can stay out of this.

158
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,719
Why is he still not awake?

159
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,119
You're up?

160
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,719
You must be starving.

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,080
I made plain congee for you.

162
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,239
Plain congee is the best
for someone who's starving.

163
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Wait for me.

164
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,719
Black Foxy has sent people

165
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,520
to bury your family

166
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,799
at the Han's ancestral grave.

167
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,039
You can rest assured.

168
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,679
I won't hurt you.

169
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,159
I'll take care of you and protect you.

170
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,840
Don't worry about what happened
to the Han family.

171
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,280
I'll get to the bottom of it.

172
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,080
Take it as repayment
for giving me medicines the other day.

173
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,159
(If you spread out the news)

174
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,239
(that you've found)

175
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,840
(Han Pu and the prescriptions,)

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,039
(they'd come looking for you)

177
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,799
(instead of you looking for them.)

178
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,000
(Black Foxy's plan is not bad.)

179
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,520
(But this child is still shocked
by what happened.)

180
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
(If I do it,)

181
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,799
(he'll suffer.)

182
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
(But I can make some changes
to the plan.)

183
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,719
(Black Foxy is good at trapping people.)

184
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,400
(It's nothing if I trap him once.)

185
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,039
(It's decided, then.)

186
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,880
Do you want another bowl?

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,520
Stop the carriage.

188
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,599
Come out now.

189
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,320
You've followed for four li already.

190
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,919
This is the best place
for you to make your move.

191
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,479
Hei Fengxi, hand over
the Han family's prescriptions.

192
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,599
She used my plan against me.

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,960
Interesting.

194
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,359
What if I refuse?

195
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,599
That's not for you to decide.

196
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,253
(Shang)

197
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,559
It looks like we won't
be going back for now.

198
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,679
Chuanyu, head out first

199
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,799
and see how things are back home.

200
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,320
Zhong Li, come with me.

201
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,039
-Sir.
-Yes, sir.

202
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,119
We've wasted a lot of time
during this trip.

203
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
If anyone finds out you were not
at the residence,

204
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm afraid there would be a danger.

205
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,960
Don't worry. It won't take too long.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,880
We might reap great benefits this time.

207
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,280
Keep me informed
of the situation at home.

208
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:33,799
Yes, sir.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,880
How is he?

210
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,599
He suffered a shock.

211
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,000
He must have been sleeping

212
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,520
and waking with a start these days.

213
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I've calmed his nerves with acupuncture.

214
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,799
He can have a good night's rest now.

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,880
Thank you.

216
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,479
I said that for him.

217
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,000
I guess

218
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,400
it's time for us to settle some scores.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,760
What scores?

220
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,599
You did come up with the plan.

221
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,280
If you want to get even,

222
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,119
you should get even with yourself.

223
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,280
If I'm alone,

224
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,000
I won't even set you up.

225
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,200
I just don't want the child

226
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,320
to see such a sight.

227
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,559
Your qi flow is still irregular.

228
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,679
Since you have the Han's prescriptions,

229
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,880
why didn't you refine the Buddha Pill

230
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,719
to remove the poison from your body?

231
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,320
It belongs to the Han family.

232
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,599
Even if I need it,

233
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,000
I should ask Han Pu's permission.

234
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
He's still in shock

235
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,039
and has never spoken since.

236
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,280
You didn't think that way
when you tried to rob them

237
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,039
of the medicines back then.

238
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,479
I did that to save people's life.

239
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,440
Since Soultaker Sect has found you,

240
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:15,880
did you find anything?

241
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,039
If you want the clue,

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,599
you should pay the price.

243
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,280
Black Foxy,

244
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm afraid I have to count

245
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
the money you sold me for.

246
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,599
Stop wasting time and tell me.

247
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
I found this

248
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,119
on one of the bodies.

249
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,239
A silver leaf?

250
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,949
(Shang)

251
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,799
What does "Shang" mean on this silver?

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,559
To prevent the silver leaves
from being lost,

253
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,760
some rich people will make
some marks on the silver leaves.

254
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,719
This silver leaf is pointing to a clan.

255
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,559
The Shang family of Yucheng.

256
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,479
It's one of the two major clans
in Yucheng.

257
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,599
The family is rich and powerful.

258
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,280
So they were the ones
who colluded with Soultaker Sect

259
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
to snatch
the Han family's prescriptions.

260
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,520
But why?

261
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,239
We'll know after we ask them.

262
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,188
(Shang)

263
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,840
Pour the tea.

264
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,520
You want me to pour you tea?

265
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,760
That's originally Zhong Li's seat.

266
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:38,479
Naturally, Zhong Li would brew
the tea too.

267
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,039
Now that you've occupied his seat,

268
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,320
it's only natural
that you take over his duty.

269
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:44,640
But

270
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,559
you can choose
to switch places with him.

271
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,719
You can drive the carriage.

272
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,919
All right,

273
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,359
I'll pour you this tea.

274
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,440
Your skills in the art of tea are
better than Zhong Li's.

275
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,159
How about considering being
my maidservant?

276
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,920
So I can drink nice tea every day.

277
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,040
I don't have nice tea,
but I do have two fists.

278
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,000
I'd like to experience

279
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,640
your skill
Phoenix of the Highest Heaven.

280
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,760
Then I wonder
if your Darkness under the Heaven

281
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,839
can take it.

282
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,599
I've never met anyone

283
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,880
who's not willing to suffer any losses.

284
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,719
There are many people in this world.

285
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,160
How could you've met them all?

286
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,520
You've never met someone like me

287
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,319
because you've known too few people.
That's all.

288
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,640
I don't like

289
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,680
everyone.

290
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,160
They all say Prince Huang Chao is proud.

291
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,000
It seems that you're prouder than him.

292
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,880
Is there no one
who can grab your attention?

293
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,439
Not really.

294
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,319
There's one.

295
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,160
Tell me.

296
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
Tell me

297
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
which unlucky lady is that.

298
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Xiyun of Qingzhou.

299
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,160
You may be skilled.

300
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,239
But you're still lacking more

301
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,599
to Xiyun in other aspects.

302
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,640
I'm sure you've never met her.

303
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,598
(Eight Pagoda, Dadong)

304
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,880
(Young Fengxi)

305
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:19,353
(Young Feng Xiyun)

306
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,079
When Xiyun was ten years old,

307
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,359
she wrote
the "Ten Strategies of Jingtai"

308
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,640
and gained fame worldwide.

309
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,719
After that, she left many poems.

310
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,760
She was an incomparable talent
since ancient times.

311
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,479
"Dejected and frustrated over wine.

312
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,479
Expressing bitterness in sorrow.

313
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,560
We don't know the fate
of someone on a shallow shore.

314
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,479
It's easy to feel heartbroken
when in a foreign land."

315
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,599
What's wrong?

316
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:57,560
My father taught me this poem before.

317
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,760
Just cry.

318
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,400
You'll feel better after you cry.

319
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm hungry.

320
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Zhong Li, stop the carriage.

321
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,280
Bring me my food container.

322
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,239
Sir,

323
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,359
we already ran out of food.

324
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,239
Didn't I tell you to prepare some food?

325
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,760
Miss Feng finished them all.

326
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,599
You didn't prepare that many anyway.

327
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,319
It's your fault
that the food is delicious.

328
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,040
One of the comments made
by Fountain Abode on you is

329
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,199
your love to eat.

330
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,520
I think that's wrong.

331
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,839
You were even greedy for food.

332
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:17,839
Where can we find food

333
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,319
in the wild?

334
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:22,000
I knew you were spoiled.

335
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,599
You would die from cold and starvation

336
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,839
if you became homeless.

337
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,760
Wait here.

338
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,640
I'll find something to eat.

339
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,280
Since you've started speaking,

340
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,920
I need your help on one thing.

341
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,400
Angelica root, lily magnolia, lychnis,

342
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,079
jilong wood, heavenly snow lotus seed,
and wanlihong.

343
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,000
These are the ingredients used
to refine Buddha Pill.

344
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,719
How did you know about these?

345
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,680
I read this prescription

346
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,839
on the day of your father's
birthday banquet.

347
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,040
I promise you

348
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,079
that I won't do evil
with your family's prescription.

349
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,959
Since you already know the prescription,

350
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,119
why do you still need my help?

351
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,040
I've tried several times

352
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,599
and failed to refine it into pills.

353
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,439
You've tried several times?

354
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,199
Jilong wood, heavenly snow lotus seed,

355
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:17,719
and wanlihong

356
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,359
are hard to buy.

357
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
You actually tried several times.

358
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,560
This is my last batch
of medicinal ingredients.

359
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,640
I can't fail.

360
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,760
Why do you need to refine the pill
when you're not poisoned?

361
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,680
I see.

362
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,239
You were doing this
for Bai Fengxi, right?

363
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,040
From her complexion,

364
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,560
there's some poison left in her body.

365
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,400
Bai Fengxi saved your life.

366
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,319
Saving her is

367
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,400
not only to help me.

368
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,719
You failed to refine the pills

369
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,079
probably because the method
of extracting medicine was wrong.

370
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,599
You must leave.

371
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,439
Yingzhou,

372
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,640
we're here to bring you home.

373
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,640
Order them to exhume the body

374
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,160
(In Memory of Yan Yingzhou)
and bring Yingzhou's body back to Jizhou

375
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,319
(In Memory of Yan Yingzhou)
for a national burial.

376
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:12,719
Yes, Your Highness.

377
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,040
Your Highness,

378
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,400
I've sent the men to search Mount Xuan.

379
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,319
We didn't find Bai Fengxi's body.

380
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,920
I think Hei Fengxi has taken her away.

381
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,400
Then the Empyrean Token

382
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,560
must be in Hei Fengxi's hand.

383
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,239
We must not let the thing
Yingzhou defended with his life fall

384
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,640
into the hand of others.

385
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,560
(In Memory of Yan Yingzhou)
I won't allow it

386
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:35,880
even if it's Hei Fengxi.

387
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,520
Order the men
to find Hei-Bai Fengxi's whereabouts.

388
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,520
I want to meet

389
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,319
these two masters myself.

390
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:47,880
Yes, Your Highness.

391
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,042
(Tianshuang Sect)

392
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:56,280
Hand over Bai Fengxi
and the Empyrean Token!

393
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,520
I've told you

394
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,839
(Tianshuang Sect's Disciple, Xiu Jiurong)
that Bai Fengxi has yet returned.

395
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,199
We don't believe you!

396
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,599
Let us search Tianshuang Sect!

397
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
(Tianshuang Sect)
Are you trying to break into our sect?

398
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,474
Why don't you look at yourselves

399
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:06,599
(Sect Leader's Daughter, Bai Langhua)
in the mirror?

400
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,319
If you want to enter,
you'll have to defeat us first.

401
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,456
(Tianshuang Sect's Leader, Bai Jiande)

402
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,280
Stop it!

403
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,400
(Tianshuang Sect)
Greetings, Master.

404
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:26,479
Are you trying
to make Tianshuang Sect your enemy?

405
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,000
Master Bai,

406
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,839
we naturally don't wish
to make you our enemy.

407
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,680
The Empyrean Token concerns the world.

408
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,920
We only want to obtain
the Empyrean Token

409
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,079
and escort it back to the Imperial City

410
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,880
to end all conflicts.

411
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,599
Could it be

412
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,720
that Tianshuang Sect is coveting

413
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,634
(Tianshuang Sect's Disciple, Gu Yu)
the Empyrean Token?

414
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,280
We have no intention to do so.

415
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,640
If you speak nonsense again

416
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,760
and slander Tianshuang Sect,

417
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,079
I won't be polite.

418
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,359
We naturally believe

419
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,199
in Master Bai and Tianshuang Sect.

420
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,800
But Bai Fengxi...

421
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,920
She's our sect's disciple.

422
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,280
She naturally won't covet
the Empyrean Token.

423
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:01,959
But if you still want
to make a scene here

424
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,319
and disturb our cultivation,

425
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,520
I won't let you off the hook easily.

426
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,400
Master Bai, we'll take our leave.

427
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,640
We'll take our leave!

428
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,359
Bai Fengxi sure is a troublemaker.

429
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,439
It was only a couple of days ago

430
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,000
when you pestered the storyteller

431
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,439
to tell the battle
at Mount Xuan three times.

432
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
You also kept saying

433
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,160
that Bai Fengxi is your Martial Sister.

434
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,800
I was happy on Tianshuang Sect's behalf.

435
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,719
Gu Yu, take them inside.

436
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,479
Yes, Master.

437
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,839
Han Pu is already asleep.

438
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,079
Thank you.

439
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,760
Who are you thanking me for this time?

440
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,800
I'm thanking you on my behalf.

441
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,040
Pu gave me a Buddha Pill.

442
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,760
I know you must be the one
who provided the medicinal ingredients.

443
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,479
I just don't want you to delay me

444
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,040
when we reach Yucheng.

445
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,719
I should say the same thing to you.

446
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm hungry.

447
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,479
We just had dinner four hours ago.

448
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,959
They say a generous person has
a big stomach,

449
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,439
while my stomach is as vast as an ocean.

450
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,160
Come on. Let's eat something.

451
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:32,839
I'm not hungry.

452
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,560
Yes, you are.

453
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,680
You don't have any money.

454
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,000
It's not that.

455
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,520
It's too heavy for me
to carry money around.

456
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,959
Come on, don't waste time.

457
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,920
Let's go and have something to eat.

458
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,000
Otherwise, I'm going
to eat around for free

459
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,079
in your name.

460
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

461
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,839
there are many experts
in the martial arts world.

462
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,400
-But among these experts...
-Excuse me.

463
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,839
A plate of beef, a roasted goose,

464
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,599
and a stray of steamed buns.

465
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,560
Please wait for a moment.

466
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,199
Sir, please have a seat.

467
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,199
They're Immortal Tianji
and Immortal Taiyin.

468
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:05,119
Those two immortals have long lived

469
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,520
a secluded life
from the martial arts world.

470
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,239
Why didn't you pick a room?

471
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,760
No one knows their whereabouts.

472
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,199
You're indeed a picky person.

473
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,680
Isn't it great to be in a lively crowd?

474
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,880
The soldiers pressed the border.

475
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,520
It was bleak,

476
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,400
and the smell of blood filled the air.

477
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,800
These two showed their skills

478
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,599
during the battle.

479
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,439
They were the famous Hei-Bai Fengxi
from the martial arts world.

480
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,040
The battle was in full swing.

481
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,439
The corpses
were lying all over the ground.

482
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:36,119
Only a few remnants
were still struggling to fight.

483
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,719
-Then, the earth fell apart.
-Please enjoy.

484
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,479
In that instant,
people wet their pants in terror.

485
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,319
Do you have a small change?

486
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,439
I don't bring small change.

487
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,719
I only have silver leaves.

488
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,079
It turned out to be Bai Fengxi.

489
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,000
When Bai Fengxi flared up,

490
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,760
a man in black stood at the other end.

491
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:52,479
This person was...

492
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,839
Thank you.

493
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,520
Hei Fengxi, who is on a par with her.

494
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,479
Both of them...

495
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,920
Miss, what's the meaning of this?

496
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,640
It's to reward you.

497
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,000
Thank you, Miss.

498
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,599
But you need to do me a favor.

499
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,640
It has always been Bai-Hei Fengxi
in the martial arts world.

500
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,119
There was never a saying
of Hei-Bai Fengxi.

501
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
Please don't make this mistake
in the future.

502
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,560
Yes, of course.

503
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,599
So please repeat it.

504
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:19,319
They were the famous Bai-Hei Fengxi

505
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,119
from the martial arts world.

506
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,400
-Then Bai Fengxi and Hei Fengxi
-Thank you.

507
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,479
fought together.

508
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,560
This battle put everything upside down.

509
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,119
Heaven and earth changed color.

510
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,239
When Hei Fengxi roared,

511
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,319
the dragon emerged from the clouds.

512
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,479
That's the reason you ask
for money from me?

513
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,760
I don't like being inferior to others.

514
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,880
Bai-Hei Fengxi sounds nice.

515
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,400
As it reached the clouds,

516
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,719
it saw Queen Mother had

517
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,599
a peach banquet in a flash!

518
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,880
(It's about time the matter is solved.)

519
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,239
Feng!

520
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,359
It looks like they've made their move.

521
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,119
Sir.

522
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,319
So you already knew.

523
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,520
Did you think I really wanted
to eat with you?

524
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,239
From the clean plates,

525
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,760
I guess so.

526
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,439
I didn't want to waste food.

527
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
If we hadn't left,

528
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,839
they wouldn't have come.

529
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,040
I'm sure you know where they went.

530
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,719
Since when did you find out?

531
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,079
From

532
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
the moment you chose the inn.

533
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,479
Fountain Abode is set up
all over the country.

534
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,959
You'd set up everything
before you set out anywhere.

535
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,760
And this time

536
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,479
you chose an inn.

537
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,439
Sure enough, you know me best.

538
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,239
Of course.

539
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,319
Zhong Li, lead the way.

540
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,000
Yes, sir.

541
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,719
No need. Just give us the address.

542
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,760
Bring Han Pu back.

543
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,199
No, I want to come with you.

544
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:52,920
No...

545
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,719
Let's go together, then.

546
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,319
Follow me.

547
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,800
(Wang's Tofu Store)
Sir, this is the place.

548
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,760
It's you!

549
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm going to kill all of you!

550
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,760
It was them! They did it!

551
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,199
They killed my family!

552
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,319
I'm going to kill them!

553
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,800
Han Pu.

554
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,119
Tell us.

555
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,719
Where are the rest
of the Soultaker Sect's members hiding?

556
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
They...

557
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Are they...

558
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,359
They've taken their own lives.

559
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,279
Han Pu,

560
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,040
those from Soultaker Sect are dead.

561
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,000
You can say you've avenged
your family's death.

562
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But you must remember

563
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,199
you must never kill anyone.

564
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,520
Killing people won't make anyone happy.

565
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,760
Even if it's for revenge.

566
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,079
Paying blood with blood

567
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,479
will never end.
It's going to be endless.

568
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,760
I'll get rid of the rest
of the Soultaker Sect.

569
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,520
But you must not stain your hands
with blood.

570
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,119
Understand?

571
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,199
Let's go.

572
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,119
Master,

573
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,719
the people we sent were found out.

574
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,920
(Soultaker Sect's Leader)
They were all killed

575
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,800
(Soultaker Sect's Leader)
by Bai Fengxi and Hei Fengxi.

576
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,959
As expected of Hei-Bai Fengxi.

577
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,359
I suppose they've found some clues.

578
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,959
That's why they're coming to Yucheng.

579
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,280
Since that's the case,

580
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,800
I'll be waiting for them here.

581
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,395
(Hot Spring Palace, Yongzhou)

582
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,746
(Hot Spring Palace)

583
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,239
Chuanyun.

584
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
(Hei Fengxi's Guard, Ren Chuanyun)
Why did you come back by yourself?

585
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,239
(Hei Fengxi's Guard, Ren Chuanyun)
Where's Young Master?

586
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,119
He still has unfinished business.

587
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,560
He's heading to Yucheng with Zhong Li.

588
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,199
Yucheng?

589
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,760
It's less than half a month
before the autumn hunting.

590
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,680
If he failed to return in time,

591
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,839
what should we do then?

592
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,280
Why is Young Master going to Yucheng?

593
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,239
Is it for the Empyrean Token?

594
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,400
He said

595
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,119
he'll obtain a great harvest in Yucheng.

596
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,119
I understand.

597
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,959
(Hot spring Palace)
I hope he can make it back in time.

598
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:17,959
Third Prince has been keeping

599
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:18,959
an eye on us.

600
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,040
I'm afraid there might be trouble.

601
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,160
While you were away,

602
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,760
Third Prince had come
to probe around several times.

603
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,280
Young Master has already figured it out.

604
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,400
This letter is from Young Master.

605
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:30,560
(Chuanyun, I'll leave
all the affairs at home to you.)

606
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,129
(Spread words that
I have relapsed from my old injury...)

607
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,719
I guess this is all we can do now.

608
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,280
Let's meet with Miss Huan

609
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,439
to follow Young Master's order.

610
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,240
(Hot spring Palace)

611
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,479
Are you trying

612
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,439
to use these to compensate
for yesterday's food?

613
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,040
Don't underestimate these raspberries.

614
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,959
They're sweet and sour,
and they complement the tea.

615
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,839
It's tasty.

616
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,000
Are you sure you don't want to try it?

617
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:36,880
I...

618
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,520
Tasty, right?

619
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,520
I knew you'd like it.

620
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,120
Master,

621
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,000
we've destroyed Fountain Abode's

622
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,840
hideout in Yucheng.

623
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,919
There are no survivors left.

624
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,600
All right.

625
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,399
I just don't understand one thing.

626
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,360
You've set up traps

627
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,159
to wait for Hei-Bai Fengxi to come.

628
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,479
Won't destroying the hideout alert them?

629
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:58,679
Once they know

630
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,159
we've destroyed the hideout
of Fountain Abode in Yucheng,

631
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,879
they might not come to Yucheng anymore.

632
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,320
You underestimate these two too much.

633
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,399
These two won't be scared
by this incident.

634
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,040
Do you know

635
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,560
what Hei Fengxi's biggest strength is?

636
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,879
It's said he has a move called
"Darkness under the Heaven".

637
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,800
Hei Fengxi's strength doesn't lie
in martial arts.

638
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,360
But the intelligence network
of Fountain Abode around the country.

639
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,479
These hideouts are his eyes.

640
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,479
They observe the country
and collect intelligence for him.

641
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,520
Losing Fountain Abode would mean

642
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:30,159
losing half of his strength.

643
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,520
I understand now.

644
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,000
Are you all right?

645
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:50,879
You've been sitting there all day.

646
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
Did anything happen?

647
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,399
Just worry about yourself

648
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,320
and don't disturb me from thinking.

649
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,439
Tell me.

650
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,280
Tell me about it.

651
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,280
Fountain Abode may provide intelligence
to the world.

652
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,080
But its hideouts are hidden.

653
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,399
I've recruited

654
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:16,199
many skilled people for every branch.

655
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:19,760
But Soultaker Sect actually destroyed

656
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,399
my hideout in Yucheng in one night.

657
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,639
It looks like I underestimated them.

658
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,040
We must not take
the person behind this lightly.

659
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,199
So you're scared now.

660
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:31,879
I'm not scared.

661
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,239
I just don't know how
to find the Shang family

662
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,439
and find out the truth without the help

663
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,040
from Fountain Abode.

664
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,479
Black Foxy,

665
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,280
you're usually smart.

666
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,040
Why are you a fool now?

667
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,600
I'm not a fool.

668
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,520
Yes,

669
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,239
you're not a fool.

670
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,000
You were too dependent on external help.

671
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,639
You built up

672
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,919
Fountain Abode step by step.

673
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,280
What about before that?

674
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,479
Have you forgotten that you used
to be in the martial arts world?

675
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,280
Thank you for reminding me of that.

676
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:04,719
Since Soultaker Sect knew

677
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,360
we're heading to Yucheng,

678
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,840
I'm sure they've set up
many traps for us.

679
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,479
Do you still want to go?

680
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,919
Of course. Why shouldn't I?

681
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,239
I'm brave, so I'm not scared.

682
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,399
It looks like you already have a plan.

683
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,560
Yucheng is an important city
of Shangzhou.

684
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,800
It's the richest place.

685
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,879
The Shang family is one
of the two local tyrants in Yucheng.

686
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:28,320
We may not be

687
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,239
their match if we join hands.

688
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,439
The only way to handle
a local tyrant is

689
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,600
to find another local tyrant's help.

690
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,360
Since you already have a plan,

691
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,399
I'll take some rest then.

692
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,120
Indeed,

693
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:54,520
you may be a particular person.

694
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,719
But your carriage's couch is
really comfortable.

695
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,439
Wake me when we reach Yucheng.

696
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,000
Gadgets and trinkets for sale!

697
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,315
(Denglin Restaurant)

698
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:14,800
Come again.

699
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,919
Thank you, Feng.

700
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,560
Eat more.

701
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,719
The food in Denglin Restaurant is

702
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:28,639
delicious.

703
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,959
I feel sorry for the food

704
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,439
from the way you gobbled them up.

705
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,600
You don't know anything.

706
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,800
They are happy to be eaten by me

707
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,879
because they're converted
into my strength.

708
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,360
Yes.

709
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,000
You're right about that.

710
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:44,560
This one is delicious.

711
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,879
Han Pu, eat some.

712
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,919
Thank you, Feng.

713
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:48,639
When are we going
to the Qi's Residence?

714
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,320
We'll wait for them to come to us.

715
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,520
This horse...

716
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:54,520
What are you doing?

717
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,959
This horse is excellent.

718
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,239
I want it.

719
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,560
-Make an offer!
-Feng,

720
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,639
this meat is very salty.

721
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,360
Is it?

722
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,959
You might not know who I am.

723
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:05,360
(Young Master of the Qi Family, Qi Yun)
I'm Qi Yun of the Qi family

724
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,080
(Young Master of the Qi Family, Qi Yun)
in Yucheng.

725
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,239
Tell your master

726
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,280
that I want this horse.

727
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,800
I've told you
that this horse isn't for sale.

728
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,080
It's not up to you to say that!

729
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,919
You look like a sticky bean cake!

730
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,760
What did you say?

731
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,399
Mung bean cake.

732
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:17,120
You...

733
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:18,560
Time to go.

734
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,840
It's time for you to make an appearance.

735
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,280
Me?

736
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,919
There's no free lunch in this world.

737
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,239
Now?

738
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,840
I knew he was up to no good.

739
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,840
Wait here.

740
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,679
You must be his master.

741
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,479
I want this horse.

742
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,879
Make an offer.

743
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
My servant has told you

744
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,199
that this horse is not for sale.

745
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,239
You might not know who I am.

746
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,120
I'm...

747
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,000
You were so loud just now.

748
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,239
Do you think my Young Master is deaf?

749
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,080
Fine.

750
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,600
Since you know
I'm the Young Master of the Qi family,

751
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,239
how dare you treat me so arrogantly?

752
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,919
You're going to regret this.

753
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,919
You're going to sell me this horse

754
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,600
whether you like it or not!

755
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,120
Master Zhao!

756
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,840
I wanted

757
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:23,840
to let you make the offer.

758
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,399
But now...

759
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:26,239
See?

760
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:28,040
Only two silver leaves left.

761
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,159
This is the price of your ignorance.

762
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:32,399
I'm afraid

763
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,280
you were the ignorant one.

764
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,719
Xi, it's your turn.

765
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:43,919
(Xi?)

766
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:50,159
Zhao Qinghou,

767
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,520
you're the leader of Qiujiang Alliance

768
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,600
who has become the manservant
for a household, aren't you?

769
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,239
Since you know who I am,

770
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,199
don't seek trouble.

771
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,840
You speak without thinking.

772
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,560
Since I know who you are,

773
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
that means I'm not scared of you.

774
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,919
You'd better leave now.

775
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:05,280
I shall see what skills you can show me.

776
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,919
Mr. Qi, anything else?

777
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,679
Just wait here.

778
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,959
Carry that useless thing!

779
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:22,600
Carry him!

780
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,479
You called "Xi" very smoothly.

781
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,600
Black Foxy,

782
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,120
what exactly are you up to?

783
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,919
I thought we were going
to work with the Qi family.

784
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,520
Now, you taught Mr. Qi a lesson.

785
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,439
What exactly are you thinking?

786
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,439
