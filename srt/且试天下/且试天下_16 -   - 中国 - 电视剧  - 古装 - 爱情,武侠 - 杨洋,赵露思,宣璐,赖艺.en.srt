Let's go.

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,839
With the two of us working together,

22
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,440
it'll be a stroll

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,360
even if it's the 18th level of hell.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,160
I also want to see

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,680
what Old Taiyin looks like.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,119
Care for a game of Go with me?

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,279
Allow me, Master Taiyin.

28
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
As expected of Old Taiyin.

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,639
One's greatest enemy

30
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,800
is oneself.

31
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,160
Unfortunately,

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,119
no matter how alike we are,

33
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,039
you are but pawns on the board.

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,479
And I prefer

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,360
to be the player.

36
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,839
Black Foxy.

37
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,679
I know myself

38
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,119
the best.

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Open the door!

40
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,239
Mother!

41
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,239
Mother, open up!

42
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,519
If I hadn't snuck out of the palace...

43
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,640
If I hadn't been so playful...

44
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,640
Perhaps Mother wouldn't have died.

45
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,399
Isn't that right?

46
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,959
At least we would've
been able to see her one last time.

47
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,239
That means we... we...

48
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
We killed her, didn't we?

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,519
Maybe...

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,959
That's why I have to kill you.

51
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,440
I'll kill you!

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,760
Black Foxy.

53
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,000
You're wrong.

54
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,399
Mother's death is indeed a pain for me.

55
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,119
But I have lived with it for so long.

56
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,920
Only by removing those shackles

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
can I move forward.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,440
It is useless

59
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,839
to blame ourselves.

60
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,279
It's better for us to face it!

61
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,239
You have a good disposition.

62
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,760
This is the final test.

63
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,679
Life is like a game of chess.

64
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,079
The chessboard represents
the three thousand strands of worry.

65
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,279
Cut all of them off,

66
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
and you'll win the game.

67
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Black Foxy!

68
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,320
Are you all right?

69
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,799
Are you okay?

70
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,040
Thank you.

71
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,640
Oh, young lady.

72
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,799
You destroyed
my Lanke Formation just like that.

73
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,239
How peculiar.

74
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,160
I can't believe we actually encountered

75
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,600
a situation that appears in stories.

76
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,760
It's just a game of Go.

77
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,720
Is it really that dangerous?

78
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,679
What did you see?

79
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,279
The ever-changing uncertainties

80
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,480
and matters in life.

81
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,799
Your mind is free of worry.

82
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,799
Of course, you wouldn't
be affected by the game.

83
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,679
You're saying

84
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,399
that I only know
how to make merry, aren't you?

85
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,479
Master Taiyin.

86
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
Does this mean we passed?

87
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,320
Everyone in the martial arts world

88
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,840
is vying for the Sacred Jade Moon.

89
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,440
Yet,

90
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,239
both of you
are deferring to one another.

91
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,520
Could it be

92
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,479
that you aren't

93
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,960
interested in my skill?

94
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,080
That is not the case, Master Taiyin.

95
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,280
She is the reason I came to Mount Wu.

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,559
It would be good
if I could acquire the secret manual,

97
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,919
but it's not a loss

98
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,239
even if I didn't.

99
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,119
What about you,

100
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,559
young lady?

101
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,760
Me?

102
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:28,400
I came

103
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,919
to save my master and my martial sister.

104
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,400
I was never after the secret manual.

105
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,119
Besides, if Black Foxy

106
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,239
got the secret manual

107
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,520
and mastered
the most powerful skill in the world,

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,479
I would just make him teach it to me.

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm sure

110
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,640
he wouldn't want
to be without a well-matched rival.

111
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,359
Right?

112
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,559
Fascinating indeed.

113
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,400
It is fate that you have

114
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,320
made it this far.

115
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,559
I may have founded
the Sacred Jade Moon,

116
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,960
but I couldn't reach its peak.

117
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,599
It depends on each of you to see how far

118
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,719
both of you can take it.

119
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,840
To the left is  Sacred Enlightenment.
To the right is Jade Moon.

120
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,440
Don't miss your chances.

121
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,599
To think they would grasp

122
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,919
the mastery of this skill so well.

123
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,559
Oh, no!

124
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,320
Hei Fengxi!

125
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:15,239
Concentrate and harmonize
your mind and actions!

126
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,239
Black Foxy.

127
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,400
Master Taiyin, what's wrong with him?

128
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,120
His inner force was thrown into chaos

129
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,280
when he tried
to cultivate Sacred Enlightenment Skill.

130
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,559
I'm afraid his qi flow might deviate.

131
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:41,159
You will have to form
a large circle of vital energy

132
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,000
by using the Jade Moon Chant

133
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
to get a chance to save him.

134
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,359
Don't be hasty.

135
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Forming a large circle of vital energy
takes time and steps.

136
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,559
My heart cannot be at ease

137
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,080
as long as he is in danger.

138
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,880
The only way to save him

139
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,559
for me is to speed things up.

140
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,159
Even I would need

141
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,479
half a day to form
a large circle of vital energy

142
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,520
when I was younger.

143
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,039
You're going against
your vital energy channels

144
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,599
in your pursuit of speed.

145
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,479
You're risking your life!

146
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,200
Is it really right

147
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,440
of you to do this?

148
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
There are too many things that matter

149
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,000
more than right and wrong in this world.

You have to let go
of some things in life

153
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,559

169
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,599
what matters if I keep one of them?

170
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:39,772
♪Night is when the Day sleeps♪

173
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,520

178
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,919
(So the Yangui Array)

179
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,119
(is one of life and death.)

180
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,159
(The array
in the mountain has lost its power.)

181
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,159
(That means someone
must have succeeded.)

182
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,960
What has gotten into you?

183
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,200
You may have restored his inner force,

184
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,559
but he had qi flow deviated earlier.

185
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,080
To have him regain consciousness,

186
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,320
you must press four acupoints, Baihui,

187
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:57,119
Shenting, Yamen, and Fengchi.

188
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,320
Those are all fatal acupoints...

189
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,760
So you must be extremely careful.

190
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:06,200
His life is at your fingertips.

191
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,679
It turns out the Sacred Jade Moon

192
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,280
requires
the communion of heart with heart.

193
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,119
To be willing to give

194
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,280
and sacrifice for each other

195
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,160
in life and death
is key to mastering the technique.

196
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,599
So that's how it is.

197
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,359
So that's how it is.

198
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,119
Greetings, Young Master.

199
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,199
Is everyone here?

200
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,359
They are all gathered outside Mount Wu.

201
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,719
We found the signs you left.

202
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,000
The members of the martial arts world
will have to pass through this area

203
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,119
to leave the mountain.

204
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,479
Set up an ambush there.

205
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,439
Yes, Young Master.

206
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,479
Will you not be coming down
with us, Young Master?

207
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,839
I came to seek the Sacred Jade Moon.

208
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,119
I'll see

209
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,959
who took it.

210
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,920
You head down the mountain.

211
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:58,959
Yes, Young Master.

212
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,400
Your Highness.

213
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,160
Neither Mr. Yu nor Miss Feng
came down from the mountain.

214
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,119
Who do you think

215
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,680
among them received Old Taiyin's legacy?

216
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,760
Those two?

217
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,719
It's hard to tell.

218
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,119
Father. We've inspected the horses.

219
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,119
We have enough
to meet His Lordship's demand.

220
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,800
Any news from His Highness?

221
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,920
The Fountain Abode's divisions
are looking everywhere for him.

222
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,040
But they haven't found anything yet.

223
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,920
The matter of the military horses
has been settled.

224
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
By right, His Highness
should be returning to the capital.

225
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,839
His Lordship will surely

226
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,280
reward His Highness
during tomorrow's court meeting.

227
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,479
It will be a problem

228
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
if His Highness isn't there.

229
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,920
I'll have our people at the eastern frontier 
keep searching at once.

230
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,520
I think His Highness didn't go
to the eastern frontier at all.

231
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,400
Do you know where
His Highness might have gone?

232
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
His Highness
most probably went to Mount Wu.

233
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,359
I've sent the gyrfalcon

234
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,479
to look for His Highness in Mount Wu.

235
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,599
Mount Wu?

236
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Mount Wu is only half a day's journey
from the capital of Yongzhou

237
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
if he travels at full speed.

238
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,119
He should be able
to make it back in time

239
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,239
if he rushes back now.

240
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Old Taiyin set up an array in Mount Wu.

241
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
I wonder if the gyrfalcon

242
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,760
will be able to find His Highness.

243
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,400
Did His Highness go to Mount Wu

244
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,160
in search of Old Taiyin's legacy?

245
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,160
According to a message
from the Fountain Abode,

246
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,599
Miss Feng went there as well.

247
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,119
Miss Feng? Her again.

248
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,800
Congratulations.

249
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,760
Thank you, Master Taiyin.

250
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,599
My time

251
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,640
is almost up.

252
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,400
There are two things

253
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,319
I want to give you two.

254
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,040
The Great Map of Dadong

255
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,000
is the work of my heart and soul.

256
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
I hope you will see to it

257
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,839
that it is used in the right way.

258
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,040
Thank you, Master Taiyin.

259
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,760
Young lady.

260
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,119
I like you.

261
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,640
I am

262
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,719
giving this

263
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,079
to you.

264
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,760
This flower is beautiful.

265
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,599
This flower is my greatest treasure.

266
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,400
Its name is Sacred Jade Moon as well.

267
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,400
I grew it myself.

268
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,760
It only blooms once every few decades.

269
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,719
When it blooms,

270
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,520
the flower will fall off the branch

271
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,479
like a ripe melon

272
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,119
and grow a new life on its own.

273
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:23,880
It will live
for as long as you provide it

274
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,880
with inner force every day.

275
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,920
I'll remember your words, Master Taiyin.

276
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,640
Perhaps it might unexpectedly be of help

277
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,160
to both of you

278
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,640
when you encounter
a life-or-death situation someday.

279
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,599
So you must take good care of it.

280
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,479
Thank you, Master Taiyin.

281
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
Guide them out of here.

282
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,000
Yes, Master Taiyin.

283
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,839
Master Taiyin, you...

284
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,359
Everyone has their own destiny.

285
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,400
This place was originally

286
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,880
a grave Master chose for himself.

287
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,319
Follow this path, and you will
be able to leave this mountain.

288
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,680
I will stay here

289
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
to watch over my master's grave.

290
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,760
Thank you.

291
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,479
Yu Wuyuan?

292
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,400
I sensed
that Master Taiyin had passed on.

293
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,719
That is why I have come
to see him off for the last time.

294
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,280
Your thought is appreciated, Mr. Yu.

295
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,119
I'm sure Master
will know from above.

296
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,359
I have a question.

297
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,359
Has Bai Fengxi mastered
the Sacred Jade Moon?

298
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,880
I can tell you nothing.

299
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:18,040
Please answer me.

300
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,439
You won't get an answer from me.

301
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,680
Since you refuse to answer me,

302
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,479
I'm afraid
I'll have to take drastic measures.

303
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,560
The Heart Destroyer Palm?
You are a descendant of the Locust?

304
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,479
I knew it.

305
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,079
Even Master Taiyin's servant
is so knowledgeable.

306
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,640
I thought 
all of the Locust and Cricket's army

307
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,319
had been annihilated 
in the Battle of Chongde.

308
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:40,640
To think their dregs still exist.

309
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,520
Dregs?

310
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,359
I believe you are misunderstood.

311
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:48,479
The Locust and Cricket
are ancient beasts.

312
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,959
They were sent down
to purify the mortal realm.

313
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,040
And now, I have only come

314
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,199
to purge this turbid world

315
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,199
as per my ancestors' wishes.

316
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,319
You are the one
who deviated from the right path.

317
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,239
Enough nonsense!
Are you going to tell me or not?

318
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,000
(I can't be sure who among them)

319
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,680
(acquired the Sacred Jade Moon yet.)

320
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,680
(What's more, both of them are here.)

321
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,199
(I can't do anything to either of them.)

322
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Mr. Yu? Why are you here?

323
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,119
Miss Feng.

324
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,439
I didn't expect Mr. Feng to be here too.

325
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,359
I heard sounds of struggle
coming from the foot of the mountain.

326
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,839
I think
the leaders of the sects are in danger.

327
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,079
We have to hurry.

328
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:20,560
Father!

329
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,599
Father!

330
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:29,880
Master!

331
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,119
Master!

332
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,160
I'm fine.
Find a way to get us out of here.

333
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,520
(So that's what happened.)

334
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:56,800
Master!

335
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,760
Father!

336
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:58,920
Are you all right, Master?

337
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm fine.

338
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,319
We were trapped in Mount Wu for days

339
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,280
and attacked
by the Soultaker Sect earlier.

340
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:05,719
We've certainly
been through quite the trouble.

341
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,359
I'll be the host today.

342
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,079
Would the sect leaders

343
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,439
care to join me?

344
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,160
- All right.
- Very well.

345
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,760
What about you, Mr. Feng?

346
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,760
I have some
private matters to take care of.

347
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,599
I

348
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,280
shall bid everyone farewell now.

349
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,119
Miss Fengxi?

350
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:22,800
She will be coming with me.

351
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,239
In that case,

352
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,280
take care, both of you.

353
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:29,760
Everyone.

354
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:30,719
Please.

355
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,520
- Come on.
- Let's go.

356
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,040
Who said I was going with you?

357
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Master Bai is injured.

358
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,719
It's not a good idea for him

359
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,599
to return
to Tianshuang Sect immediately.

360
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,319
We're closer
to the capital of Yongzhou right now.

361
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,160
Will you come along with me?

362
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,599
You've already decided.

363
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,760
Why bother asking me?

364
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,760
Is no one going to ask me what I think?

365
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,599
Master.

366
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,959
Pardon my rudeness, Master Bai.

367
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,199
Would you be willing

368
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,640
to recuperate
in the capital of Yongzhou, Master Bai?

369
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,599
Well,

370
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,719
let's head to the capital of Yongzhou

371
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,280
and recuperate for now.

372
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,920
Then, we'll leave
for the capital of Yongzhou overnight.

373
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,599
I will have them

374
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,359
arrange the accommodation 
for all of you.

375
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:34,622
(Prince Yongping's Residence)

376
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,520
- Zhong Li.
- Zhong Li.

377
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Has His Highness returned?

378
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,280
His Highness had Cangyi
deliver a message to us.

379
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,359
He should be back in time.

380
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,000
The court meeting is about to begin.

381
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,920
I don't think His Highness will make it.

382
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,719
His Lordship will surely
ask about his whereabouts.

383
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
What should we do?

384
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,280
Maybe we say that His Highness was
exhausted from the trip and fell ill?

385
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,319
We can't.

386
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,599
His Lordship
would send someone to check on him.

387
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,163
(Prince Yongping's Residence)

388
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,479
We're out of time.

389
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:06,000
Long live Your Lordship.

390
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,719
Rise.

391
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,880
Thank you, Your Lordship.

392
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,680
I have asked all of you
to attend this court meeting today...

393
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,040
Why isn't Prince Yongping here?

394
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,079
Prince Yongping must've overexerted
himself from gathering the horses

395
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,199
for Your Lordship.

396
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,880
That's why he couldn't make it today.

397
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,119
Did he ask for a leave of absence
or excuse himself?

398
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,280
Your Lordship.

399
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,359
Prince Yongping
did not inform us of the matter.

400
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,400
Father.

401
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,520
Lanxi achieved a great deed
by managing to gather

402
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,119
sufficient horses
in such a short amount of time.

403
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,199
It must not have been easy.

404
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,000
Please allow him to rest

405
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
out of consideration,

406
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,680
seeing as he
achieved such a feat, Father.

407
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,959
That is not right, Prince Ju.

408
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,280
Even if Prince Yongping
has done something worthy of credit,

409
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,000
he shouldn't miss a court meeting
without giving prior notice.

410
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
Merits and demerits
should be handled accordingly.

411
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,280
We can't let him act as he wishes
just because he achieved merit.

412
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,199
Could it be

413
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:01,319
that Prince Yongping is
trying to claim credit and put on airs?

414
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,680
Send someone
to Prince Yongping's residence at once.

415
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:04,800
He is

416
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:07,280
to attend
this court meeting no matter what.

417
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,359
Yes, Your Lordship.

418
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,920
Prince Yongping has arrived.

419
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,359
Greetings, Father.

420
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,719
Long live Your Lordship.

421
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,439
Why are you late?

422
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,640
Were you actually trying to put on airs?

423
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,520
I wouldn't dare.

424
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,239
I was held up by some matters.

425
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,719
I only managed to return
to the capital early this morning.

426
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,319
Rise.

427
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,280
The horses arrived yesterday.

428
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,040
Were you not busy

429
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,280
preparing them
for His Lordship, Prince Yongping?

430
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,839
What were you doing then, Your Highness?

431
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,959
This is

432
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,359
why

433
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,640
I was delayed.

434
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:10,684
(The Great Map of Dadong)

435
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,599
The Great Map of Dadong?

436
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,880
Yes.

437
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,800
I...

438
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
How can we tell if it's the real thing?

439
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,359
Minister Qin.

440
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,160
You've seen the true map before.

441
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,119
Verify if this is authentic
for me at once.

442
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,239
Yes, Your Lordship.

443
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:34,529
(The Great Map of Dadong)

444
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,280
(The Great Map of Dadong)

445
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,160
It's real.

446
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,000
Your Lordship.

447
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:44,599
This was definitely
created by Old Taiyin himself.

448
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,040
The Great Map of Dadong is
a map that recorded the hydrography

449
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,359
and geography of all the arduous
mountains and rivers of Dadong.

450
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,959
Congratulations, Your Lordship.
The heavens have blessed Yongzhou!

451
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,959
Congratulations, Your Lordship.
The heavens have blessed Yongzhou.

452
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,439
Bring it to me quickly.

453
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:03,160
(The Great Map of Dadong)

454
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,428
(The Great Map of Dadong)

455
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,640
The Great Map of Dadong.

456
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,000
Rumor has it that this map
was in the hands of Old Taiyin.

457
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,560
How did you get your hands on it?

458
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Old Taiyin is a saint of our generation.

459
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,760
I didn't expect you
to be acquainted with him, Lanxi.

460
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,160
Forgive me, Father.

461
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,880
I hid something from you.

462
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,280
Tell me about it.

463
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,400
When I fell into the water that time,

464
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,959
it wasn't the fisherfolk who saved me.

465
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,839
It was Old Taiyin.

466
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,800
He was also the one

467
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,920
who helped cure me of the illness
that had plagued me since young.

468
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,719
He taught me some martial arts as well.

469
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,680
But he explicitly forbade me

470
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,199
from revealing
the matter to anyone else.

471
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,280
It is just as Ju said.

472
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,839
Old Taiyin is a saint of our generation.

473
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,520
That is why
I dared not inform you, Father.

474
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,040
I received a letter
from him when I was gathering

475
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,040
the horses in the eastern frontier.

476
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,920
He said his days were numbered

477
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,319
and asked me to go to Mount Wu.

478
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,239
So I took a detour
and headed to Mount Wu

479
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,439
to procure this map for you, Father.

480
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,319
I know my mistakes, Father.

481
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,880
Please punish me.

482
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,040
Get up.

483
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,119
You have done a great service to Yong.

484
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,319
I shall reward you well.

485
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:20,880
Your Lordship.

486
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,680
If the other five states learn

487
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,599
that we acquired this map,

488
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,839
they will surely

489
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,000
think twice
about challenging our nation.

490
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:33,359
Prince Yongping has just as well
allowed us to resist 50,000 troops.

491
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,839
Yong must be blessed by the deities.

492
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,479
Yong must be blessed by the deities.

493
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,280
Long live Your Lordship.

494
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,439
Rise.

495
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,719
Your Lordship.

496
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,119
The Imperial Ambassador has arrived.

497
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:55,839
Yuan Lu.

498
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:58,839
Quickly!

499
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,640
Send him in.

500
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,840
I remember you have a distant relative

501
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,879
who works in the Ministry of Rite
in the Imperial City.

502
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,080
There is something

503
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,600
I need your help with.

504
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,600
Are you sure about this, Your Highness?

505
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,439
I want

506
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,879
to make the first move this time.

507
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
The matter of the military horses

508
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,840
gave me some credibility as well.

509
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,679
Follow the plan.

510
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,000
I understand.

511
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,639
Greetings, Your Lordship.

512
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,080
You may rise.

513
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,280
What is the reason for your visit?

514
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,199
I have come bearing gifts and a decree
for the ceremony from His Majesty.

515
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:01,600
Please accept the decree, Your Lordship.

516
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,600
Understood.

517
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,879
An imperial decree from His Majesty.

518
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,040
"My biological sister,

519
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,159
Princess Yige, is an exemplar

520
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,919
of grace and honor.

521
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,760
She is gentle, elegant, and refined.

522
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,719
As she was kind and virtuous,
the late emperor

523
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,719
married her to the Lord of Yongzhou.

524
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,800
She was enthroned as his queen.

525
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,719
Unfortunately,
those whom the heavens love die young.

526
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:35,560
They took her away from us too soon.

527
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,040
In the blink of an eye,
20 years have passed.

528
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,679
When I recall those memories,

529
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,199
my heart pains, and I miss her dearly.

530
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,040
As such,
I have sent gifts to commemorate

531
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,719
my late sister's day of birth.

532
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,080
That is all."

533
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,080
I, Feng Yu, accept the decree.

534
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,239
His Majesty is getting up in years,

535
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,040
and has been reminiscing
about his family a lot lately.

536
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,919
It happens to be Princess Yige's
40th birthday in heaven soon.

537
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,040
That is why
His Majesty has sent me here.

538
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,399
Oh, right.

539
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:17,040
His Majesty received news
that Prince Lanxi had been promoted.

540
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:20,040
His Majesty misses his nephew.

541
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
May I know where His Highness is?

542
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,879
Xi, come and pay your respects.

543
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,320
I, Prince Yongping, Feng Lanxi,

544
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,360
greet His Majesty.

545
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, you mustn't, Your Highness.

546
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,199
Your Highness, you're
handsome and regal indeed.

547
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:38,000
You look very much alike His Majesty.

548
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,040
It must be because Princess Yige
has been watching over

549
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,679
Your Highness from above.

550
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,199
You are too kind.

551
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
My mother has passed away.

552
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,560
Fortunately, I am loved by my father.

553
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,879
And now,
I have been blessed by His Majesty.

554
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,959
All of Yongzhou are grateful
for His Majesty's benevolence.

555
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,760
Please lead me to Princess Yige's tomb
so that I may pay my respects to her.

556
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,320
May I know the location
of Her Highness' temple?

557
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,040
We are humbled by your kindness.

558
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,959
My late mother's birthday

559
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:12,320
is in three days.

560
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,919
You've had a tiring journey.

561
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,399
There is no rush to pay your respects.

562
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,280
Please head to the relay station

563
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,040
and rest for a few days first.

564
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,239
On the day of the ceremony
of my late mother's birthday,

565
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,560
I shall personally go to greet you

566
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
and lead you
to pay your respects to her.

567
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,040
Please head to the relay station

568
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,159
and get some rest, Imperial Ambassador.

569
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,800
I shall do
as you say then, Your Lordship.

570
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:33,879
Yuan Lu.

571
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,040
Xi.

572
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,159
You handled that well.

573
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,919
You are busy with court affairs, Father.

574
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,959
Mother's birthday memorial
isn't part of the official rites either.

575
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:52,479
It was enough for me to pay respects
to her on that day myself.

576
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,000
However,

577
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,120
I think we'll need to prepare and set up

578
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,719
a proper altar and memorial ceremony
for her 40th birthday in heaven now.

579
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,159
Indeed.

580
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
Where is the Minister of Rite?

581
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,479
Present.

582
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:11,439
Tomorrow,

583
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,679
the memorial ceremony
for the late queen will take four hours.

584
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,479
Got it.

585
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,959
You are dismissed.

586
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,159
Yes, Your Lordship.

587
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,959
You must be tired, Your Lordship.

588
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,239
You don't have to worry

589
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,719
about the matters in the palace.

590
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,719
I've arranged for the plain attires

591
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,760
to be delivered and handed out

592
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
already.

593
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,560
I made some soup to help
soothe your nerves myself as well.

594
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:49,719
Try some.

595
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,283
(Queen Yige's
40th Birthday Memorial Ceremony)

596
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,719
That's considerate of you.

597
00:38:59,239 --> 00:38:59,919
What's the matter, Baili?

598
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,000
It's nothing.

599
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
What's wrong?

600
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,360
I just feel a little lightheaded.

601
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,600
Her Highness
hasn't been feeling well lately.

602
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,239
And she has been busy all day today.

603
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,159
She almost fainted on her way here.

604
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:13,520
Be quiet.

605
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:14,840
Look at you.

606
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,159
You should rest
if you aren't feeling well.

607
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,320
Why go to the trouble of making soup?

608
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,719
I have others to serve me.

609
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,439
They can't serve you as I do.

610
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,719
Summon the physician.

611
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,560
Yes, Your Lordship.

612
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,560
Your Lordship.

613
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
From the looks of it,
Her Highness will most likely

614
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,479
not be able
to attend the ceremony tomorrow.

615
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,760
In my humble opinion...

616
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,399
If it's a humble opinion,

617
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,520
you should keep your mouth shut.

618
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,000
Don't use your petty thoughts

619
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,360
to speculate about the queen.

620
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,800
Who do you think she is?

621
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:44,360
She is the Queen of Yongzhou.

622
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,760
She is virtuous and noble.

623
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,800
She is considerate
and understands the bigger picture.

624
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,760
Even if she is so ill
that she can't get up,

625
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,600
she must know how important
tomorrow's ceremony is.

626
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:53,760
It's one thing

627
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,919
to embarrass us
before the Imperial Ambassador.

628
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,199
It's another to bring shame to Yongzhou.

629
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,320
Am I right,

630
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,639
Baili?

631
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,919
You are correct, Your Lordship.

632
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,840
My illness isn't anything serious.

633
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,320
I won't let it
affect tomorrow's ceremony.

634
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,199
You're so sensible, Baili.

635
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,840
In that case, I'm sure

636
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,800
nothing will go wrong
at tomorrow's ceremony.

637
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,679
I won't disappoint you, Your Lordship.

638
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,800
I appreciate that.

639
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,159
Mother.

640
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:34,897
(Memorial Tablet of Queen Shengchun)

641
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,399
I used your birthday

642
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,320
to give a warning to Queen Baili.

643
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,120
I'm sure you must be displeased.

644
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:43,719
(Memorial Tablet of Queen Shengchun)
When I was young,

645
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,679
(Memorial Tablet of Queen Shengchun)
you always taught me

646
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,560
not to treat others with ill intent.

647
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,800
In the end, I couldn't obey you.

648
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,320
Mother.

649
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,840
I did a lot of things

650
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,719
after you left me.

651
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,679
Right and wrong alike.

652

(Memorial Tablet of Queen Shengchun)

653
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,600
I'm sure you must be able

654
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,280
to see what I did from above.

655
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,080
I wonder if you would
be glad to see them

656
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,280
or would you abhor them?

657
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,719
In fact, ever since you left,

658
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,040
I've long been all alone
without anyone to rely on.

659
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,639
However, I refused to surrender to fate.

660
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,120
I want to fight as well.
