Now,

21
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,480
you are the only one 
who chould be my heir.

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,959
In the past,

23
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,720
I wanted to have everything in my grasp.

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
But in the end,

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,839
everything slipped through my palms.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,040
I have decided

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,239
to entrust my throne to you.

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,000
But do tell me,

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,639
what do you plan to do next?

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,399
What do you want me to do?

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
The Imperial Family's power
is dwindling.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,679
All other states have their eyes
on the throne.

33
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,320
From the affair of Minister Wang,

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,199
you can tell how ambitious and cunning

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,960
Jizhou is.

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
At this rate,

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,080
what action Yongzhou should take

38
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,960
is

39
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,039
up to you now.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,600
Once you assume the position,

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,800
whether it's your harem or politics,

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000
you have to do it the proper way.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,119
Don't meddle
in the martial arts world anymore.

44
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,080
People will talk otherwise.

45
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:46,919
Right.

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,679
I will not forget your advice, Father.

47
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,039
As for your marriage,

48
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:56,080
find someone who will benefit Yongzhou.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,399
Or, you can decide whoever.

50
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,639
Now that you're my heir,

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,240
I'm sure you will have

52
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,279
Yongzhou's interest in heart.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,320
Right?

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,479
Of course.

55
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,800
Good.

56
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,800
Go now.

57
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,600
See you, Father.

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,039
Your Lordship.

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,240
Her Highness

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,399
has been buried.

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,160
Prince Ju's mental state

62
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,399
has not seen any improvement.

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,239
A ruler is often lonely.

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,559
Such is the way of life.

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm sure Queen Yige

66
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,239
would be proud of you when she knew

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
you have become the heir of Lord.

68
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,880
I want to thank you.

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,880
I met you when I just started

70
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,239
in the martial arts world.

71
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,920
And thanks to you,

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,519
I saw the kindness of the world.

73
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,000
And thanks to your company,

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,559
I know what true feelings mean.

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
It's all thanks to you

76
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,359
that I gave the world another chance.

77
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,559
As the Prince of Yongzhou,
Feng Lanxi, proved himself

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,239
to be virtuous and revered,

79
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,799
moral and respectful,

80
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,519
loyal and patriotic,

81
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,679
wise and ambitious.

82
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,040
Hence,

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Feng Lanxi will be bestowed the title
of the heir of Lord of Yongzhou.

84
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,239
Your Highness, come forth.

85
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,559
Your Lordship, now is the time
for the seal transfer ceremony.

86
00:05:59,119 --> 00:05:59,799
From now on,

87
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,160
you are my heir.

88
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,359
You will shoulder the duty

89
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,600
of developing Yongzhou,

90
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,959
and protecting the citizens of Yongzhou.

91
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,760
The world counts on you,

92
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,679
so you should not
disappoint our predecessors.

93
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,119
Your advice will be forever entrenched
in my mind, Father.

94
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,799
Greetings, Your Highness.

95
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,640
Mother,

96
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:58,438
(Memorial Tablet of Queen Shengchun)

97
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,519
I'm here to pay you a visit.

98
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,679
Those who brought harm to you

99
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,839
had to serve their sentence now.

100
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,559
May you rest in peace

101
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,399
in Heaven.

102
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,541
(Memorial Tablet of Queen Shengchun)

103
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,040
Mother,

104
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,000
I would like to present someone to you.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,920
I wish to stay by her side all my life.

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,119
Her name is Bai Fengxi.

107
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,200
Queen Yige.

108
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
From now on,

109
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,399
I will do my best to protect Lanxi

110
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,679
and take care of him.

111
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,119
You need not worry.

112
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,873
(Memorial Tablet of Queen Shengchun)

113
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,320
Everything in Yongzhou has concluded.

114
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,599
I should

115
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,320
think about my next step.

116
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,000
Next step?

117
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:15,799
To marry you, of course.

118
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,239
I brought you to see my mother

119
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,080
and told her everything.

120
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,599
That is the proof of my sincerity.

121
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,080
Why?

122
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,479
You don't want to?

123
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,640
No.

124
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
That's a yes then.

125
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,359
You're putting words in my mouth.

126
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,599
Bai Fengxi,

127
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,359
I'm serious.

128
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,880
Decide now.

129
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,599
Once you have made up your mind,
don't regret it.

130
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,239
Yes.

131
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:01,719
Greetings...

132
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,679
At ease.

133
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,359
What happened to Qingzhou?

134
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,320
Xieyue told me

135
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,599
that if it wasn't an emergency,

136
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,679
he wouldn't send you to me.

137
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,200
Your Highness,

138
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,320
Qingzhou is now
facing an invasion from Youzhou.

139
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,599
His Highness is leading the army.
Nothing too serious so far.

140
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,960
However, His Lordship
is in great ailment.

141
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,919
His Highness wants me to bring you back.

142
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,359
Ailment?

143
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,119
A sudden one or...?

144
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,119
Why was I never privy to this info?

145
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,000
His Lordship has been sick for a while.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,359
His Highness did not want to worry you

147
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:27,840
so...

148
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,520
I see.

149
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,440
I will head back immediately.

150
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,919
Noted.

151
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,719
I have made some snacks.

152
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,200
Try them.

153
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,799
You must have worked

154
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,119
really hard recently.

155
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,880
Qiwu said

156
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,919
that you are the hope
of the Yongzhou people.

157
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,039
I never thought it that way,

158
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,359
but now,

159
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
I can believe it.

160
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,119
When you have to answer
to your nation and your subjects,

161
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,239
your private matter
just seems so inconsequential.

162
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,559
You're not the Black Foxy anymore.

163
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,640
You're the Heir who is responsible

164
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,960
for the entire Yongzhou.

165
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,799
Since the moon is bright
and beautiful tonight,

166
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,919
I will give you my blessing.

167
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,520
May all your wishes come true

168
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,080
and may your state be peaceful

169
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,159
so that you can continue
protecting the people of Yongzhou.

170
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,359
You

171
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,000
are different today.

172
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,719
Not only did you make
some snacks for me,

173
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,280
but you also gave a peculiar speech.

174
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,159
I'm happy for you.

175
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,080
Do you know what was in my mind

176
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,599
when I was given the position today?

177
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,200
What?

178
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
I was thinking

179
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,919
how it is only perfect

180
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,520
if you're beside me.

181
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,440
The world or you.

182
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,359
Why can't I have both?

183
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,440
Can I

184
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,400
give you an explanation in the future?

185
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,200
Black Foxy,

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,840
I need to leave Yongzhou for a while.

187
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,599
I will go to Qingzhou with you.

188
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,840
You knew?

189
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,559
I thought my identity
was mysterious enough

190
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,200
but yours is a cut above.

191
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm surprised, truth be told.

192
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,080
Like I said,

193
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,400
we will face everything together,

194
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,559
no matter what it is.

195
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,400
Now that I am aware of

196
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,320
Qingzhou's predicament,

197
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,479
I can't possibly let you face it alone.

198
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,719
You were with me
as I handled my affair in Yongzhou.

199
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,599
How can I just let you deal

200
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,359
with Qingzhou without any help?

201
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:46,640
But...

202
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,840
Like I said,
we will face everything together,

203
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
no matter what it is.

204
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,520
I am your Black Foxy now,

205
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,559
not the heir
of Lord of Yongzhou, Feng Lanxi.

206
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,840
How can you leave me out of it?

207
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,400
Let's leave now.

208
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:11,799
Sure.

209
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,780
(Qingzhou)

210
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,679
Xiyun,

211
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,440
you're finally back.

212
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier, Xieyue?

213
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,400
Father didn't want you to worry

214
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,719
so he didn't allow me to tell you.

215
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,320
He came with you?

216
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,440
He's worried about me
so he came with me.

217
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,880
He's now waiting by the side hall.

218
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,320
I'm glad

219
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,960
he took good care of you.

220
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
That reassures me.

221
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
I can make sure you're always

222
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,640
in good company.

223
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,080
Everything will be all right.

224
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,520
Father,

225
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,440
I am a bad daughter.

226
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,039
I didn't know you were...

227
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,239
I am as healthy as a horse.

228
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,359
Besides,

229
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
when I see you,

230
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,479
all my ailments disappear!

231
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,559
Get up now, my child.

232
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,280
Get up.

233
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,559
Here, have a seat.

234
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,039
My child,

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,679
you're finally back.

236
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,359
Wonderful.

237
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm over the moon.

238
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,320
I have

239
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,520
heard a lot about you.

240
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,840
Your tales and your legacy.

241
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,479
I am proud of you.

242
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,599
My daughter

243
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,760
is smart,

244
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,159
beautiful,

245
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,840
educated, and skilled.

246
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,679
Not many men are worthy

247
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,679
of you.

248
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,039
You see,

249
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,280
at the moment,

250
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,919
Youzhou and Jizhou

251
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,039
are invading Qingzhou together.

252
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,719
Xieyue

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,479
has to manage the politics alone.

254
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
He has too much on his plate
to lead the army.

255
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,559
Jizhou and Youzhou came in full swing.

256
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,880
They are well-prepared

257
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,960
and we quickly lost our edge.

258
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm worried

259
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,039
that Xieyue couldn't stand
toe to toe with Huang Chao.

260
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,039
Father,

261
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm back.

262
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,200
I will help Xieyue

263
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,719
and defend Qingzhou.

264
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,200
Good.

265
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,679
Great.

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,359
Upon closer inspection,

267
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,280
you bear the visage

268
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,039
of your mother

269
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,599
yet your personality
is so different from her.

270
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,119
You are prideful.

271
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:58,919
I'm happy.

272
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,160
Your mother and I are childhood friends.

273
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
We are deeply in love

274
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,479
and she gave birth to Xieyue and you,

275
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,239
a wonderful pair of children.

276
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,680
I

277
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,719
can leave this world in content.

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,760
How is Father?

279
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,000
He's asleep.

280
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,239
I checked his health.

281
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,959
He won't last long.

282
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,520
How long has he been sick?

283
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,800
His health started

284
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,119
to deteriorate a year ago.

285
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,359
A year ago?

286
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,839
During this year, I traveled

287
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,359
and wandered around.

288
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,040
I ignored my father's old age.

289
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,680
I was absent when I should have been
there to share his burden.

290
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,160
It's not your fault.

291
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,520
Father knows his condition.

292
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
He doesn't want to upset you.

293
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:23,760
However,

294
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,000
we have a crisis now.

295
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,599
I need to discuss something with you.

296
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,239
About the frontline?

297
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,000
Father has told me.

298
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:32,040
Xieyue,

299
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm willing to lead the army.

300
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,280
No,

301
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,920
you should stay in Qingzhou

302
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,239
and handle state affairs.

303
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,640
But you have been managing
state affairs on Father's behalf.

304
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,800
You are more familiar in that regard.

305
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,239
Xieyue,

306
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,280
let me lead the army.

307
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,040
At the moment,

308
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,760
Youzhou's Golden Armor Cavalry
has arrived.

309
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
Langcheng is in another battle.

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,880
I am the Heir

311
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,400
so I should set an example for others.

312
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,640
Besides, no brother

313
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,800
will send his dear sister
to the battlefield.

314
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:01,959
But...

315
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,520
This is not negotiable.

316
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,040
Don't worry.

317
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,439
Xu Yuan is there.
Fengyun Cavalry is there too.

318
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,119
I will return safely.

319
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,040
It's just that with the death
of Emperor Chunxi,

320
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,760
a war among the Six States
is inevitable.

321
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,680
If we lose Langcheng,

322
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:16,760
Qingzhou

323
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,880
will just be a piece of meat

324
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,280
in everyone's eyes.

325
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,520
We have to win this war.

326
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,000
Stay in the palace

327
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,000
and take care of Father.

328
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,760
I will report a victory

329
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,280
to reassure Father.

330
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,439
All right.

331
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,479
I will make sure
the state affairs are taken care of

332
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,920
and wait for your return.

333
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,040
All right.

334
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,778
(Memorial Tablet of Qingzhou Queen)

335
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,520
(Memorial Tablet of Qingzhou Queen)

336
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,520
Mother,

337
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,280
I'm back.

338
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,360
(Memorial Tablet of Qingzhou Queen)

339
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,280
Qingzhou is in a crisis.

340
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,119
Father is gravely ill.

341
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,280
Xieyue is leading the army.

342
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,719
And I can't do anything to help.

343
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,280
All of you have been
protecting and pampering me.

344
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,680
I can do

345
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,239
whatever I want.

346
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,920
I am never afraid when I'm traveling
in the martial arts world.

347
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,959
But now,

348
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,800
I fear the passing of Father,

349
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,520
and the harm
that can come to Xieyue's way.

351
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,119
Mother,

352
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,359
what should I do?

353
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,079
Whenever I return,

354
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,680
I'll keep you abreast with recent news.

355
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,280
Lanxi returned with me this time.

356
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,719
We have known each other for many years.

357
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,880
We have been through ups and downs

358
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,359
and he has never abandoned me.

359
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,359
He promised me

360
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,400
that he would help Qingzhou.

361
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,479
May we

362
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,599
come out of this crisis unscathed.

Don't worry, Mother.

365
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,479
I'm all grown up now.

366
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,839
I will take up my responsibility.

367
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,640
I promise you

368
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,280
that I will protect
the people of Qingzhou.

I have news! Xieyue is here.

00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Youzhou's Lead Infantry
has been subdued.

385
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:00,359
His Lordship is now retreating.

386
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,239
What?

387
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,599
Dismissed.

388
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,400
Yes, Your Highness.

389
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,520
Don't worry, Chunran.

390
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,880
The outcome of a war is only decided

391
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,359
at the very last moment.

392
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,239
Why did you suggest to my father

393
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,439
to pretend
that we're attacking Langcheng?

394
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,119
Knowing what the Golden Armor Cavalry
is capable of,

395
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,760
they can raze Langcheng to the ground.

396
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,680
It's not the right time yet.

397
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,640
If we raze Langcheng to the ground now,

398
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,959
it will affect our ambush strategy.

399
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,719
Headbutting Qingzhou

400
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,439
will just be a tough fight.

401
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,439
We lull our enemies

402
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,479
into a false sense of security.

403
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:34,800
So it's just a ruse?

404
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,239
Only when the enemies
put their guard down

405
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,079
that the ruse can work.

406
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,359
Otherwise, it won't be easy

407
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,040
for Youzhou to conquer Qingzhou.

408
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,839
Also,

409
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,199
I heard that Feng Lanxi

410
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,520
became the heir of Lord of Yongzhou.

411
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,280
Are you scared of Yongzhou?

412
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,920
Better safe than sorry.

413
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,719
However, I'm waiting for an opportunity

414
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:01,239
to completely dismantle Qingzhou.

415
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,719
But Xieyue is here.

416
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,920
Doesn't that mean Lord of Qingzhou
has fully recovered?

417
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,400
What is this opportunity you spoke of?

418
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,280
Qingzhou doesn't only have Xieyue, you see.

419
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,479
Princess of Qingzhou, Feng Xiyun,

420
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,119
exists too.

421
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,920
Chunran, let's stop here today.

422
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
All right, I shall take my leave.

423
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,920
However, we are married.

424
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:28,599
I do not want a husband
who hides something from me.

425
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,160
Don't you worry.

426
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,719
Xieyue is here.

427
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,319
Should Skyrider Cavalry
make their entrance now?

428
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,119
It's just Xieyue.

429
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,479
We don't need
to mobilize the entire cavalry.

430
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,920
Besides,

431
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,920
you know my plan, don't you?

432
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,599
At the moment,

433
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,640
Youzhou will suffer a huge loss.

434
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,959
You can usurp Youzhou

435
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,239
but it won't benefit you.

436
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:01,800
Youzhou has a backup plan.

437
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,239
Lord of Youzhou still hasn't
shown his true hands.

438
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,000
Then this is the best way
to minimize casualties.

439
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,479
I can conceal my true power

440
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,319
while avoiding unnecessary death.

441
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Two birds, one stone.

442
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,795
(Qingzhou)

443
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,319
Your Lordship,

444
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,000
Prince Feng is here.

445
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,560
Dismissed.

446
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,959
Yes, Your Lordship.

447
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,439
Greetings, Lord of Qingzhou.

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,479
May you live for a millennium.

449
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:38,839
At ease.

450
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,040
Thanks, Your Lordship.

451
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,479
Come, have a seat.

452
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,040
Bai Fengxi, Feng Xiyun.

453
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,040
Hei Fengxi, Feng Lanxi.

454
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,199
You two are meant to be together.

455
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,119
May I know why you summoned me?

456
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,800
I summoned you

457
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,280
to see

458
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,160
if my daughter has great taste or not.

459
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,719
And what is your conclusion?

460
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,199
Not bad.

461
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:31,920
Quite good.

462
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,359
However,

463
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,760
I have heard

464
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,640
many things about you.

465
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
You're a bully, aren't you?

466
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,319
However,

467
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,479
you can never ever

468
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,040
bully my daughter.

469
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,319
I will always cherish her.

470
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,560
I believe you.

471
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,959
But life is long.

472
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,280
You will meet
many problems and difficulties.

473
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,680
No matter what,

474
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,959
stay true to your heart

475
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,239
and treat each other with honesty.

476
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,239
While

477
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,199
both of you belong to different states,

478
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,800
as long as you two
remain on the same page,

479
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,959
then there's nothing you can't overcome.

480
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,079
Noted.

481
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,160
All my life,

482
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,920
politics and the royal court
have been my preoccupations.

483
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,199
I hardly have time for my family.

484
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I regret it.

485
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,479
Xiyun won't admit it

486
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,760
but I know

487
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,800
she resents me.

488
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,920
To my surprise,

489
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
she found

490
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,400
another politician to be her lover.

491
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,119
Destiny,

492
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,959
perhaps.

493
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,479
Your state is important.

494
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,119
But

495
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,199
make some time

496
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,719
for your family too.

497
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,599
Otherwise,

498
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,520
you will die with regrets.

499
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,239
Take it as a piece of advice

500
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,839
from someone who has been through it.

501
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,439
I understand.

502
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,439
I believe in the choice

503
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,680
of my daughter.

504
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,781
(Qingzhou Encampment)

505
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,880
Although Lord of Youzhou lost
their Lead Infantry,

506
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,040
their Golden Armor Cavalry
is still nowhere to be seen.

507
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,199
I believe

508
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,800
the final assault
will take place in a few days.

509
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,479
In your opinion,

510
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,959
how likely are we to be victorious?

511
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,000
Without Huang Chao,

512
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,079
Youzhou will lose.

513
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,280
Alas,

514
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,766
Huang Chao and Yu Wuyuan

515
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:16,920
(Qingzhou)
are within the Youzhou Encampment.

516
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:17,880
(Langcheng)

517
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,839
Even if the Skyrider Cavalry
is not deployed,

518
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,520
everything can change suddenly.

519
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,760
We won today.

520
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,439
We should continue
while the morale is high

521
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,760
and show them
what Fengyun Cavalry can do.

522
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,760
Be prepared for war.

523
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:31,800
Yes, Your Highness.

524
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,439
Speak frankly, General Xu.

525
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:39,920
Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,640
Now that the Emperor has passed away,

527
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,800
all Six States are up in arms.

528
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
Youzhou is invading Qingzhou

529
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,479
while Shangzhou and Beizhou
are amassing military power.

530
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,959
Jizhou even backs up Youzhou.

531
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,119
I worry

532
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,400
about Qingzhou's future.

533
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,479
I came to Langcheng

534
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,439
because Xiyun is back.

535
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,119
The Princess Xiyun is back!

536
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,040
Xiyun and I

537
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
will defend Qingzhou's future.

538
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,520
With her as our support,

539
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,079
it will take a great deal
of trouble off us.

540
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,479
However, other states are coveting us.

541
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,520
What is your plan, Your Highness?

542
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,560
How do we get out of this?

543
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,160
I know what's in your mind, General Xu.

544
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,640
Qingzhou has always been
a peaceful country.

545
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,319
What we have always defended
is our national security.

546
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,599
If all states are united,

547
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,359
another empire will rise.

548
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,040
And then,

549
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,000
if the Emperor is a wise one,

550
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,359
Qingzhou will be cooperative
and be part of his territory.

551
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:31,719
However,

552
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,280
if anyone wants
to claim Qingzhou at this moment,

553
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
we will fight back.

554
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,239
I see.

555
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,119
News!

556
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,280
Youzhou Army is approaching.

557
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,040
They are one li away from the gate!

558
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,319
They are swifter than anticipated

559
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,040
and choose to attack tonight.

560
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,479
Listen to me now.

561
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,959
Use everything to defend.

562
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:54,760
Yes, Your Highness.

563
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:58,719
General Xu,

564
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,599
I need you

565
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,079
to escort the citizens to Licheng.

566
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,800
I will face the Youzhou Army myself.

567
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,479
Your Highness,

568
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,680
I am willing to go on your behalf.

569
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,719
The livelihood of our people
is as important.

570
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:13,160
I will face the enemies.

571
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,479
But Your Highness,

572
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,119
the blades on the battlefield
have no eyes.

573
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,680
The future of Qingzhou relies
on your personal safety.

574
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,000
Please think twice.

575
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,520
General Xu, this is a monumental battle.

576
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,119
If I lead the army myself,

577
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,520
it will boost the army morale.

578
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,800
I will protect myself.

579
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,599
As for the innocent,

580
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,359
I count on you, General.

581
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,760
Yes, Your Highness.

582
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,479
I will return as soon as possible.

583
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,000
News!

584
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,719
Around 20,000 Youzhou men are invading.

585
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,400
The frontline can't hold them off
and needs support.

586
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,119
Follow my lead

587
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,719
and defend our state!

588
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,439
Charge!

589
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,920
Qingzhou is now at war.

590
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,439
Get ready now.

591
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,280
Make sure Xieyue dies.

592
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,079
Noted.

593
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,959
Retreat!

594
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,160
Retreat!

595
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,079
Sir, Xieyue is dead.

596
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,839
Have you sent out the news?

597
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,640
Everyone will know

598
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,920
in a few days

599
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,400
that Youzhou killed Xieyue.

600
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,280
Our objective has been accomplished.

601
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,479
Due to the passing of Xieyue,

602
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,040
Jizhou and Youzhou
will be Qingzhou's sworn enemies.

603
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,199
The world is about to break down.

604
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,839
Noted.

605
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,479
The Cricket army is fully mature

606
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,479
but it's not the time
to release them yet.

607
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,479
Wait for the right timing.

608
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:37,880
Yes, Sir.

609
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,479
At this rate,

610
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,359
Feng Xiyun has no choice but to join in.

611
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,479
Your Highness,

612
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,359
someone
from the Fengyun Cavalry returned.

613
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,479
He wants to see you.

614
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,359
Show him in immediately.

615
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:57,880
Yes, Your Highness.

616
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

617
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:07,800
I...

618
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,080
Langcheng is gone?

619
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,120
Yes.

620
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,600
The Golden Armor Cavalry of Youzhou
invaded Langcheng last night.

621
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,280
His Highness led the army himself

622
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,520
and was shot

623
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,600
by a poisonous arrow.

624
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,879
He has passed away.

625
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,719
Where is he now?

626
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,120
Outside of the gate.

627
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Didn't you say

628
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,479
you would spare father the worry?

629
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:41,320
To return safely?

630
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,840
Why?

631
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,600
Look how well
I managed the state affairs.

632
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:51,199
Open your eyes and look at me.

633
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,560
Open your eyes.

634
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,760
Open your eyes!

635
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:01,600
Your Highness,

636
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,520
Prince Xieyue sacrificed his life

637
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,479
to protect the citizens.

638
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:07,919
Before our enemies invaded,

639
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,080
His Highness asked General Xu

640
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,719
to evacuate the people to Licheng.

641
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:15,919
All who survived the war in Langcheng

642
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,760
retreated to Licheng too.

643
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,760
Pardon our incompetence.

644
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,040
We failed to protect Langcheng.

645
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,360
We failed to protect His Highness.

646
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,760
Please punish us, Your Highness.

647
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,879
Please punish us!

648
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,600
Our people are safe.

649
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,399
Please get up, my generals.

650
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,080
You risked your life to protect us.

651
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,600
You did nothing wrong.

652
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:38,520
Father.

653
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:42,320
Last night,

654
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,239
Xieyue came.

655
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,239
He came to see me.

656
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,600
You already knew, Father?

657
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,639
He...

658
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:59,199
He stood there

659
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,879
and smiled at me.

660
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:06,840
He said

661
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,800
he didn't bring shame to Qingzhou.

662
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,479
Till the moment he drew his last breath,

663
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:18,320
he was protecting
the people of Qingzhou.

664
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,639
He said

665
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:26,239
he worried about me

666
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,320
and you the most.

667
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,280
He also said

668
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,479
he missed your mother.

669
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,120
My son

670
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,239
faced death dauntlessly.

671
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,679
As his father,

672
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,360
I should at least do the same,
shouldn't I?

673
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,199
Sorry, my child.

674
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,879
Do you know?

675
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,360
The first Ruler of Qingzhou,

676
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,719
Feng Duying,

677
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,080
was a female

678
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,399
but she was a venerable general.

679
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,679
She followed Emperor Weilie
to conquer the world

680
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,679
and left one legacy after another.

681
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,120
That's why she was given
the title of the Lord.

682
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,760
The only female ruler
