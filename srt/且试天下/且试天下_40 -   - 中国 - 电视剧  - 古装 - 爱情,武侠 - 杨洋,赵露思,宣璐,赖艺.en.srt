Pu!

22

Pu!

23
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,479
General, their backup is here

24
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,960
but our troop hasn't arrived.

25
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,000
Should we withdraw
and wait for tomorrow?

26
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,360
Withdraw!

27
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,360
Pu? Pu?

28
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,240
Open your eyes and look at me.

29
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,919
Martial Sister...

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,559
Martial Sister.

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,080
Martial Sister.

32
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:49,720
I'm here.

33
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,919
I'm always here.

34
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:53,880
Ever since

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,199
you saved my life,

36
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,199
I've been

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,759
looking for a way to repay you.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,199
Now

39
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,080
is my chance.

40
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,160
It's my fault.

41
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,639
I came too late.

42
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,639
Mr. Feng.

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,279
Please

44
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,000
take good care of my Martial Sister

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,399
for me.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,520
I promise.

47
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,360
Martial Sister.

48
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
I can't accompany you

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,240
as you travel
in martial arts world anymore

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
nor can I

51
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,360
continue healing other people.

52
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,679
In a life hereafter,

53
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:50,880
we will

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,119
be siblings.

55
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,320
Definitely.

56
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:10,119
Han Pu.

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,559
Pu.

58
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,160
Han Pu!

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
Pu!

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,392
(Tomb of Beloved Brother, Han Pu)

61
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,819
(Tomb of Beloved Brother, Han Pu)

62
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,366
(Tomb of Beloved Brother, Han Pu)

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,119
Life comes and goes.

64
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,559
The living

65
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,519
cannot dwell forever in grief.

66
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm sure Han Pu

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
doesn't want you to be like this.

68
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,440
I once asked Pu

69
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:21,276
(Tomb of Beloved Brother, Han Pu)

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
(Tomb of Beloved Brother, Han Pu)
what he wanted to do after the war.

71
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,679
Pu said

72
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,239
he would open an apothecary.

73
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,359
While the war might be over

74
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,440
but

75
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,079
the sick will remain.

76
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,040
That way,

77
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:34,679
I can still save more people.

78
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,760
When we first met,

79
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
he was as tall as this.

80
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,359
And look how fine of a gentleman

81
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,079
he has become.

82
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:55,766
(Tomb of Beloved Brother, Han Pu)

83
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,839
I thought

84
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,480
he would always be by my side.

85
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,559
I thought I could protect him.

86
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,399
But

87
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,399
in a war,

88
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,079
everything happens so quickly.

89
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,519
Pu, I will accomplish

90
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,839
your dream.

91
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,320
(Tomb of Beloved Brother, Han Pu)

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,600
I know

93
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,399
I shouldn't say it

94
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,720
but today,

95
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,399
I have to.

96
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,920
We are all ears.

97
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,119
From now on,

98
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,040
when the battle is lost,

99
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,720
retreat if you can.

100
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,599
Do you understand?

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,559
Your Ladyship!

102
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:35,840
Only then

103
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,200
I can find you

104
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,799
and rescue you.

105
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,320
Your Ladyship!

106
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,440
I will die for you!

107
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,880
We will die for you!

108
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,840
The Moyu Cavalry will die for you!

109
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,719
Mount Luoying,

110
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,679
named after the countless heroes
who died here.

111
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,320
This mountain should now
be called Mount Ying.

112
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,719
News!

113
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:08,760
Your Ladyship.

114
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,000
Dong Shufang's army is less than

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,880
three li from here.

116
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,200
My men!

117
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,479
Follow me!

118
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,320
Let's avenge our dead comrades

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,200
and spare no enemies!

120
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,679
We will win!

121
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,840
We will win!

122
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:37,919
We will win!

123
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,039
Feng Xiyun, the Queen of Qingzhou.

124
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Your reputation precedes you.

125
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,239
For the fight you put up today,

126
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,320
you have earned my respect.

127
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:16,440
General Dong Shufeng,

128
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,400
did Yu Wuyuan establish your army?

129
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,520
Yes.

130
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,919
Then the Imperial Family of Dadong
played a part in it.

131
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,520
Let's save this feud for later.

132
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,640
We'll settle the score between us

133
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,760
today.

134
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,159
A duel? I'm glad you asked.

135
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,640
To die

136
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,880
in your hands today

137
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,919
is worth it.

138
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,919
However,

139
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,719
you have not won.

140
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,239
Yu Wuyuan

141
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,559
knew you would come here.

142
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,320
Artillery will rain.

143
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,359
Tens of thousands of your men

144
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,880
will die with me.

145
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,400
Pu.

146
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,320
I have avenged you.

147
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,239
Fengxi!

148
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,559
(I will evacuate
the Queen of Qingzhou first.)

149
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,320
(Head to the Alliance Encampment.)

150
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,599
(Tell my Mentor)

151
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,840
(to stop Yu Wuyuan's plan.)

152
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,320
(If Huang Chao is in danger,)

153
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,359
(intervene.)

154
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,520
(Dadong)

155
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,359
Your Lordship,

156
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,719
they held the citizens hostage.

157
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:49,800
(Dadong)

158
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,119
Plausible.

159
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,039
Wuyuan,

160
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,520
I need you.

161
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,159
Greetings, Your Highness.

162
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,880
It's him.

163
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,159
Bring Yu Wuyuan to me!

164
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:15,783
(Dadong)

165
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,359
Lord of Jizhou,

166
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,559
you think you have the right
to see my Young Master now?

167
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,280
If you fire now,

168
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,880
everyone on the rampart
will die in your hands.

169
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,359
(So Yu Wuyuan is the mastermind.)

170
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
(He lurked beside me for many years)

171
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,159
(because he's after the whole world.)

172
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,679
(He even claimed)

173
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,719
(that he cared about the innocent.)

174
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,200

287
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,439
Yesterday,

288
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,800
I received news from Fountain Abode.

289
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,319
All three of Huang Chao's attempts
to claim the city failed.

290
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,959
Jizhou lost one hundred thousand men.

291
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,280
Yu Wuyuan held one hundred thousand
citizens hostage

292
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,239
and managed to stop Huang Chao.

293
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,000
The soldiers after us

294
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,680
withdrew back to the Imperial City

295
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,839
to fight against Huang Chao.

296
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,160
Huang Chao suffered a great loss.

297
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:14,079
Yu Wuyuan is still in the Imperial City.

298
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,000
We need to find a way to stop his plan.

299
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,760
Why did Yu Wuyuan do all that?

300
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,079
Perhaps

301
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,839
I hold the answer.

302
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:27,839
Master Tianji.

303
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,839
Greetings, Master Tianji.

304
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,319
Everyone was told

305
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,760
that the Six Lords and Emperor Weilie
founded the Dadong Empire.

306
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,800
But there was an eighth person.

307
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,319
Yu Yantian, the Empyrean.

308
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:47,439
Yu Yantian was a mentor figure
to all of them.

309
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,439
Without Yu Yantian,

310
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,040
there was to be no Dadong Empire.

311
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,479
But in the end,

312
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,400
Yu Yantian went missing.

313
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,599
In fact, Emperor Weilie

314
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,479
grew fearful of Yu Yantian's ability

315
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,680
and killed all his family.

316
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,000
Perhaps it was destiny.

317
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,439
Yu Yantian's smallest son survived.

318
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,000
The Yu's bloodline continued.

319
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,359
And then,

320
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,239
the Yu family disappeared.

321
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,280
One century ago,

322
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:28,079
the Yu family instigated a mutiny.

323
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
Discard the pawn
when it's no longer of use to him.

324
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,319
Emperor Weilie was cruel enough

325
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,359
to commit such atrocity.

326
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,560
He only has himself to blame

327
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,560
for the current predicament of Dadong.

328
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,199
While Yu Wuyuan might have
all the reasons to feel unjust,

329
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,199
he cannot put the innocent's life
on the line for his agenda.

330
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,239
For his personal vendetta,

331
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,040
he ruined lives

332
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:56,560
and destroyed peace. It's unforgivable.

333
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:57,520
Therefore,

334
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,239
to spare the people from the war

335
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,839
and to spare them the grief

336
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,719
of losing a dear one like I just did,

337
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
we need to stop him.

338
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,400
Let's head to the Imperial City now.

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,239
I see you two

340
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,839
have inherited the Sacred Jade Moon
from Old Taiyin.

341
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,520
That is wonderful.

342
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,880
Taiyin always told me

343
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,599
how he lost his wife mid-life

344
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,000
so he could never train

345
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,400
the technique to the highest level.

346
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,959
Otherwise, he would have been
stronger than me.

347
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:31,359
I hope the two of you
can connect your souls

348
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,359
and surpass what Taiyin and I achieved.

349
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:34,800
Thanks, Master Tianji.

350
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,160
Thanks, Master Tianji.

351
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:43,800
Your Lordship!

352
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,199
Chancellor Ren and General Chuanyun

353
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,319
have penetrated the Imperial City.

354
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,520
The gate has been breached!

355
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
News from the scout!

356
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,199
General Jiushuang and General Xuekong

357
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,640
have led the Skyrider Cavalry
and joined the Yongzhou army.

358
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,520
They now have the Imperial Palace
surrounded!

359
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,359
Those who use
Tianshan the Snow's technique

360
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,239
can never live longer than a decade.

361
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,280
I can't believe the Lord of Yongzhou

362
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:44,199
will share the same fate as mine.

363
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,680
So?

364
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,959
How does it feel
when your days are numbered?

365
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,599
You're mistaken.

366
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,280
I sacrificed my life willingly.

367
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,400
It's for someone I love.

368
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,359
There's no pain whatsoever.

369
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,280
Yu Wuyuan,

370
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,680
your most fatal mistake

371
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,560
is that you are willing to risk
so many people's life.

372
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,239
Don't you have the reputation
of the Empyrean Yu family to uphold?

373
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,359
Don't you have the innocent
to answer to?

374
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,199
You accuse me of betrayal?

375
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,439
My ancestor, Yu Yantian,

376
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,160
assisted Emperor Weilie
and the Six Lords

377
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,560
to build Dadong Empire.

378
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Before the Emperor
ascended to the throne,

379
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,719
he swore in front of everyone

380
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
that he would share this peaceful world

381
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,959
with the Yu family.

382
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,760
Guess what he did

383
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,040
right after he claimed the throne?

384
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
He erased my family.

385
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,439
Not even a six-year-old
or a seven-year-old kid was spare!

386
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,000
A servant

387
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,239
rescued a baby
that was not even one month old.

388
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,719
That's how the Yu family survived.

389
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,040
Tell me now then.

390
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,199
Did Dadong fail me?

391
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:51,319
Did the world fail me?

392
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,319
You're wrong.

393
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,479
You plunged the world into chaos.

394
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,199
Many innocents died in your hands.

395
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,160
How different are you

396
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,839
from what Emperor Weilie did?

397
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,119
So my family

398
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,800
has to forever live
no longer than 30 years?

399
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:07,160
Yu Yantian once preached

400
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,839
that world peace
should have priority above all else.

401
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,439
The Yu people should be self-reliant,

402
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,119
do good, and respect people

403
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,079
to ensure harmony.

404
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,319
Even a three years old child
can understand that.

405
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:18,359
But you,

406
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,800
you endanger the people's lives
for your own agenda.

407
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,839
You do not deserve your title.

408
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,640
Yu Wuyuan,

409
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,560
you cannot be more wrong.

410
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,800
No, I'm not wrong!

411
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,920
I laid low and planned many years

412
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,560
for today.

413
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,040
Dadong is in shamble.

414
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:36,959
It's time for it to welcome a new ruler.

415
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,719
And you,

416
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,920
Bai Fengxi,

417
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,599
and Huang Chao.

418
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,560
All of you are my pawns.

419
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,800
Even Huang Yu?

420
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,640
She went to the Imperial City
to look for you

421
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,119
and she hasn't come back.

422
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,040
Did you...

423
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,719
Couldn't be more dead.

424
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,520
Yu Wuyuan.

425
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,160
Why?

426
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,839
She loved you.

427
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,040
I trusted you.

428
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,400
Why?

429
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,199
To cure your Blood Curse,

430
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,599
you approached Dadong's Imperial Family.

431
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,359
You then used fake Empyrean Tokens
to create unrest.

432
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,239
Two birds, one stone.

433
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,079
Effective and ruthless.

434
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,560
You guys got it right

435
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,239
but the realization came too late.

436
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,160
You killed my Master too, didn't you?

437
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,199
He wasn't my target

438
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,439
but for some reason,

439
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,359
he knew too much.

440
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,520
The Han family's prescriptions,

441
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,719
Xuanyuan family's arrays,

442
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,199
and Tie family's armory.

443
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,880
You wanted all of them

444
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,160
to nurture your own forces.

445
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,439
You were already planning
for this moment

446
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,319
from back then.

447
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,239
Impeccable, I must say.

448
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,599
I predicted everything

449
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,479
except you two.

450
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,040
You two keep surviving.

451
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,520
When I was in Yongzhou,

452
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,680
I gave Feng Ju a nudge.

453
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,000
But

454
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,599
he was good for nothing.

455
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,479
Good thing that before Qingzhou
and Youzhou went to war,

456
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:19,680
Soultaker Sect took out Mr. Xieyue.

457
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,439
That forced you, the Queen of Qingzhou,

458
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,040
to get involved.

459
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,560
Enough talking.

460
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Let's end it here today.

461
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,359
Because tomorrow,

462
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,040
the world

463
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
welcomes a new Emperor.

464
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,000
You will die today.

465
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,359
Are you all right?

466
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,520
Remember what Old Tianji said?

467
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,400
It takes two connected souls

468
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,680
to reach the highest level.

469
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:27,760
One person by his lonesome

470
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,839
cannot use Sacred Jade Moon

471
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,800
to its full potential.

472
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,920
Let's go.

473
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

474
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,880
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

475
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,680
It seems like

476
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,640
Yu Wuyuan failed.

477
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,880
By right,

478
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,660
I should call you brother
since you're older than me.

479
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
You're Feng Xiyun,

480
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,359
the renowned Bai Fengxi.

481
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,160
The rumors did you justice.

482
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,439
Huang Chao,

483
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,119
as domineering as always.

484
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,719
You look more like an Emperor than I do.

485
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,160
I know why all of you are here.

486
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,520
The world belongs
to the one who can carry it.

487
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:44,959
I will hand it over to all of you.

488
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,920
Thanks, Your Majesty.

489
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,639
Thanks to you two,

490
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,919
I discovered Yu Wuyuan's plan in time.

491
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:32,800
Otherwise,

492
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the consequences would be far too dire.

493
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,879
No, we owe you the thank,
Lord of Jizhou,

494
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,239
for believing in us.

495
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,959
That's how
we could dismantle our enemies.

496
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,120
If I found out earlier,

497
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,320
many more could be spared.

498
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,919
What do you

499
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,080
make of this battle, Lord of Jizhou?

500
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:55,760
Since young, I aspire to be an Emperor.

501
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,719
And for that,
I worked diligently for most of my life.

502
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,560
Looking back,

503
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,800
many people died for me.

504
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
The world

505
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,040
is yours.

506
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,159
I will not contend it.

507
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,600
The people have suffered long enough.

508
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,800
I will not start another war.

509
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,800
I only hope
that you can keep your promise

510
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,120
and enforce world peace.

511
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,479
If not,

512
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,280
I will hunt you down.

513
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,600
What do you think?

514
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,080
I

515
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,520
already knew that.

516
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,320
So this burden

517
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,679
is yours.

518
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,000
May you keep your words

519
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,439
and treat your subject with kindness.

520
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,239
You...

521
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,120
No need for redundant speech.

522
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,040
I don't have much time left.

523
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,520
I just want to spend time with her.

524
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,919
See you,

525
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,560
Huang Chao.

526
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,120
I will not let you two down.

527
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,199
For as long as I live,

528
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,360
I will make sure the world is peaceful.

529
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,959
Do not forget

530
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,639
what you said today.

531
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,439
Otherwise,

532
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,679
we will hunt you down.

533
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,679
See you.

534
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,520
- Greetings, Your Lordship
- Greetings, Your Ladyship.

535
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,360
At ease, my soldiers.

536
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,159
From now on,

537
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,439
I'm no longer the Queen of Qingzhou.

538
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm Bai Fengxi.

539
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,679
Listen up,
Fengyun Cavalry and Moyu Cavalry.

540
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,800
I have heard that Lord of Yongzhou

541
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,800
is a dashing man.

542
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,919
I must say his appearance today
does not disappoint.

543
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:00,120
Therefore, I, Bai Fengxi,
will kidnap him to be my husband.

544
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,919
I hereby announce

545
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,239
that if someone comes after him,

546
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:08,159
he or she will be greeted by my blade.

547
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,280
Very over-the-top, don't you think?

548
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:17,639
People know the Queen of Qingzhou
married the Lord of Yongzhou.

549
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They didn't know

550
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,520
Bai Fengxi kidnapped
the Lord of Yongzhou

551
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,280
to be her husband.

552
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,520
I have to circulate the news

553
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,679
so that it fits my persona

554
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,840
and it's more fun.

555
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,199
I have also penned the decree.

556
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,679
All of you are to obey Feng Qiwu's

557
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,840
and Xu Yuan's orders.

558
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,040
Those who defy

559
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,919
will be seen as traitors.

560
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,159
Yes, Your Lordship.

561
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:58,840
We'll leave now.

562
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,520
Everyone!

563
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,239
See you in the martial arts world.

564
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:05,000
- Farewell, Your Lordship.
- Farewell, Your Ladyship.

565
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,320
During the war in Dongdan,

566
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,879
Huang Chao, Lord of Jizhou,
has commanded my respect

567
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,320
for his outstanding army and strategy.

568
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,159
(Decree)
From our brief exchange,

569
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,079
(Decree)
I felt his far superior compassion

570
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,320
(Decree)
towards governance and his people.

571
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,280
Lord of Jizhou is a hero

572
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,919
and will be a wise leader.

573
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,439
For wealth and glory,

574
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,959
no soldier should be sacrificed.

575
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
For world peace,

576
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,159
no innocent should suffer.

577
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,959
I depart now

578
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:03,800
but I still wish my subject

579
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,520
will support Lord of Jizhou

580
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,760
as the ruler

581
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,000
and bring peace to this world.

582
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,199
Yes, Your Lordship.

583
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:19,760
(On April,)

584
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,000
(Huang Chao ascended to the throne.)

585
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,800
(Thus began the Huang Empire)

586
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,959
(and the year of Xize.)

587
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,879
(Hua Chunran was crowned
as the Empress.)

588
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,800
You're back.

589
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,000
It smells so good.

590
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,760
Look at my wife. She's as sooty

591
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,840
as a dirty kitten.

592
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,639
Look how rough my husband's hands are.

593
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,639
How will he write poems
and play the flute now?

594
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,760
My, my. Half of my life almost went by.

595
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,600
From the moment we met until now,

596
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,399
I have been mostly greeted

597
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,719
with snide remarks.

598
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,120
When we argued, we fought.

599
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,520
Now that we're finally married,

600
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,399
things didn't turn the better.

601
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,719
Where is my harmonious
and loving marital life?

602
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,959
Why don't you

603
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,479
draw eyebrows for me?
