20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,680
Why are you tailing me?

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm here for your head.

22
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,239
Charge!

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,679
Who are you?

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,759
Retreat.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,839
Why do people always
seek to take your life

26
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,520
every time I run into you?

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
You always turn up in time.

28
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,520
Who are those people just now?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,639
I have no idea.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,759
But they don't look like they were
from Soultaker Sect.

31
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,399
I'll look into this matter.

32
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,440
I wasn't at home today.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,240
I rushed over here
when I heard of your news.

34
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,240
Let's head to House of Jade first.

35
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,960
Rubbish!

36
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,000
Tell me,

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,479
how did she get away?

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,520
Your Highness,

39
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,000
that woman has excellent martial arts.

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,559
But most importantly,

41
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,600
someone showed up to save her.

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,600
Who?

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,039
It was too dark at the time.

44
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,279
But

45
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
it seems to be Prince Yongping.

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,399
Who?

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,720
Prince Yongping.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,479
Him?

49
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,639
Why would he...

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Have you found out where she lives?

51
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,279
At the Pagoda Tree Alley.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Send more men.

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,520
This woman mustn't live.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,919
- Your Highness...
- Do as I say.

55
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,479
Yes, Your Highness.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,240
Wait.

57
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,240
I'll go with you.

58
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,759
(Your Highness,)

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
(you'll get married tomorrow.)

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,283
(Young Lord of Yongzhou)

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,320
(What about our child?)

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,440
(To Xiang)
Miss,

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,759
His Highness has written a letter.

64
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,240
Is he taking me to his residence now?

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,119
Chang will surely be recognized
as the eldest son.

66
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,639
Greetings, Your Highness.

67
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,758
(Queen of Yongzhou, Yige)

68
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,839
I didn't know,
so you must have suffered in the past.

69
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,359
Once you're here,

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,119
remember to serve His Lordship well.

71
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,480
I shall obey your order.

72
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,320
He's clumsy and frail.

73
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,480
How about letting a palace maid
be his nominal mother?

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
Is that my father?

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,040
I'll work hard. I want to be
the heir of Lord of Yongzhou

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,200
to carry on Father's great cause.

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,679
I'm sure she won't deny me

78
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,040
when I've become the feudal lord.

79
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,000
It's already been 20 years.

80
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss,

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
you're

82
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,239
so heartless.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
About your Master,

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,480
I'll send those from Fountain Abode
to investigate the matter.

85
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,119
So don't worry.

86
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,880
Thank you.

87
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,359
You were out this late today.

88
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,440
Did anything happen today?

89
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,920
It was only a trivial matter.

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,119
Why do you

91
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,119
have to be so proud
when anything happens?

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,399
Why?

93
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,839
Don't you like it?

94
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,720
Does it matter

95
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,119
if I like it or not?

96
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,239
Enough.

97
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,119
I've ordered the shop
to prepare some dishes.

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,519
I'll help you with the investigation.

99
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,239
You'll eat with me.

100
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,559
What are you doing?

101
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,799
Catch insect.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,720
What are you doing?

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,679
Catch insect.

104
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,839
Why are you sweating so much?

105
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,200
It's because of the wine...

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,839
Your pulse is racing.

107
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,519
Would you be ill? Are you all right?

108
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,640
Wine is good for blood circulation.

109
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,799
You end up like this with just
over a few cups of wine.

110
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you all right?

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,079
I'm a little drunk now.

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,320
I'll get going first.

113
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,679
(That's a little strange.)

114
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,239
(I'll drink alone, then.)

115
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,839
I must have drunk too much.

116
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,959
Otherwise, why would I find

117
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
his grin

118
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,399
to be attractive?

119
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,079
Again?

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,079
This is the capital of Yongzhou.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,279
You sure have the nerve

122
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,720
to make your move in this city.

123
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,480
In that case, I won't hold back anymore.

124
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,239
But

125
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,480
I don't want to play with you,
so I'm leaving.

126
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,559
I'm sorry about that.

127
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
Have no fear. I'll protect you.

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,479
Retreat.

129
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,799
Sorry about that. Did that scare you?

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,559
I don't know who I have offended

131
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,919
that I almost got you in trouble.

132
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,719
Don't you remember me?

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,320
We've met before.

134
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,479
You do look familiar.

135
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,320
You're...

136
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,960
You're...

137
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,840
I still can't recall.

138
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,039
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,919
I need to take my leave now.

140
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,919
Your Highness, I was incompetent.

141
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,280
No need to kill her for now.

142
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,880
I have other arrangements.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,320
Yes, Your Highness.

144
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,799
Let's see
if you were just putting up an act.

145
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,320
If you dare lie to me...

146
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,640
That man who showed up just now

147
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,440
must have sent those people to kill me

148
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,599
to hide his illness.

149
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,520
I had nothing to fear

150
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,719
if I was alone.

151
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,919
But now Master has asked me
to watch them.

152
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,599
It's better
that I don't cause any trouble.

153
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,479
I'm sure you must know

154
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,000
that Huang Chao of Jizhou is returning

155
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,119
the Empyrean Token.

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,200
I called you here today

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,359
to discuss something.

158
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,960
His Majesty wishes to hold
a Six States banquet.

159
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,119
Who do you think is

160
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,159
more suitable for me

161
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,799
to send?

162
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,400
Your Lordship,

163
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,880
I think we should send
Prince Chang this time.

164
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,599
Prince Chang is the eldest
among the three princes.

165
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,960
It's only natural

166
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,799
for him to represent Yong.

167
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,760
I think we should send Prince Ju.

168
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,599
Prince Chang may be the eldest.

169
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,880
But he's not the legitimate son.

170
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Prince Lanxi is a legitimate son

171
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,719
but he's frail.

172
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,359
I'm afraid the long and arduous journey

173
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,840
might affect Prince Lanxi's health.

174
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
After comparing,

175
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,080
Prince Ju
is the most suitable person for this.

176
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,119
Feng Ju,

177
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,559
are you willing

178
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,239
to set out to the Imperial City
on my behalf?

179
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,840
I shall obey your order.

180
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,239
Your Highness, Prince Ju is here.

181
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,400
Let him in.

182
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,080
I wish Mother fortune and health.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,440
Mother, why did you ask Minister Wang

184
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,000
to suggest that I go
to the Imperial City?

185
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,440
You've committed several foolish things.

186
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,119
Your father may not blame you.

187
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,239
But he's naturally

188
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,400
disappointed in you.

189
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,039
You should go out and explore.

190
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,599
About the matters in the capital,

191
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll be around to take care of them.

192
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,880
But Mother,

193
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,640
the royal examination is
around the corner.

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,679
It's a great opportunity for me.

195
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm afraid it's not a good time

196
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,840
for you to sit
for the royal examination this year.

197
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,919
Greetings, Your Highness.

198
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Please rise.

199
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,919
Are you here

200
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,640
about the royal examination?

201
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,359
I can't seem to hide anything from you.

202
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,200
Today,

203
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,000
I've paid a visit to Pei Youshuo,

204
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,119
Senior Secretary Pei.

205
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,039
The Feng family is indeed
well-connected.

206
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,719
Even Pei Youshuo who doesn't involve
in the court dispute is

207
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,000
on the Feng family's side.

208
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,520
Senior Secretary Pei
and my father are friends.

209
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm also Official Pei's student.

210
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,919
This time,

211
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,840
Mentor gave me a name list.

212
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,479
Your Highness, please go through.

213
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,559
Mentor has set his eyes
on these three candidates.

214
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:32,840
He said they were

215
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,599
the best candidates

216
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,640
in terms of talent,

217
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,159
character, and family background.

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,719
Now that you were granted
the title of Prince Yongping,

219
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,159
you'll need more people

220
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:45,200
on your side in court.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
There's one person missing

222
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,159
from this list.

223
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,000
Feng Shiying.

224
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,640
My brother is a member
of the Feng family.

225
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,359
So he's naturally on your side.

226
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,159
If you need to pull
these three to your side,

227
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,400
Mentor will speak to them.

228
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,919
With Mentor taking care of this,

229
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,679
they will definitely be your men.

230
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,320
I'll be counting on you, then.

231
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,440
It's my honor to serve Your Highness.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,239
I'll take my leave now.

233
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,760
Your Highness,

234
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,719
we've already investigated the incident

235
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,080
after Miss Fengxi arrived
in the capital of Yongzhou.

236
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,080
She may have caused

237
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,280
some trouble when she was

238
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,679
at House of Jade at that one time.

239
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,719
The next day,

240
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,640
Minister Feng went there once

241
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,400
with our residence's bill.

242
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,719
How did Minister Feng get
a hold of our bill?

243
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,520
I think it was Miss Huan.

244
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,119
By the way,

245
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,400
Prince Chang was there too.

246
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,760
He seemed to be ill.

247
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,280
Who are you?

248
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,479
Retreat!

249
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,200
So those were Chang's men.

250
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,119
Here's your bun.

251
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:08,840
Thank you.

252
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,159
Here you go. Don't drop it.

253
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,159
Thank you.

254
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,840
Miss, how many do you want?

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,520
One.

256
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,200
One?

257
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,840
All right.

258
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:15,679
Here's the money.

259
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,960
Miss.

260
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,479
Thank you.

261
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:21,640
You're welcome.

262
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,479
Miss, your buns.

263
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,320
Thank you.

264
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,719
All right, thank you.

265
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,159
It's you again?

266
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,080
Do you recognize me?

267
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,320
Of course, I recognized you.

268
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,359
I left you there alone last night.

269
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,039
Did they do anything to you?

270
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,000
No.

271
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:15,919
I know.

272
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,479
You must be here asking

273
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,840
for compensation

274
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,320
because I left you there alone
last night.

275
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,280
Am I right?

276
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,400
I suffered from shock last night.

277
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,400
I had to take three bowls
of calming soup

278
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,640
to recover.

279
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,320
The physician checked my pulse
and said I have

280
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,239
six vessels with sunken-fine pulses,
which severed my vitality.

281
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,960
I fear I only have several days to live.

282
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,239
But if someone is willing

283
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,239
to give their blood to me

284
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,440
and let me eat
a steamed bun dipped in it,

285
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,719
I may have a chance to live.

286
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,760
Miss,

287
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,880
can you do me this favor?

288
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,359
You were tricked.

289
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,280
You must have met a quack.

290
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,599
If I find

291
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,119
this quack,

292
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,960
I'll definitely break all his teeth.

293
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
I've checked your pulse.

294
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,039
It's extremely energetic.

295
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,520
You'll be able to live a long time.

296
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,440
So don't worry.

297
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,919
I don't have a bloody steamed bun
that you want.

298
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,919
But

299
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,440
I'll share one stuffed bun with you.

300
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:20,679
Here you go.

301
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,640
Take it.

302
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,400
I'm busy, so I have to go.

303
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,640
(That was close.)

304
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,760
(He really wanted to kill me.)

305
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,440
(He may be hateful.)

306
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,479
(But he's pitiful too.)

307
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,080
(I can only feign ignorance, then.)

308
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:03,650
(Thirty-first year of Chunxi's reign)

309
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:04,600
(Royal Examination.
Ways to promote peace.)

310
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,479
Official Pei,

311
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,520
your handwriting still has such
a vigorous style.

312
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,479
Thank you, Your Lordship.

313
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,839
Please seal the examination paper,
Your Lordship.

314
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:15,839
All right.

315
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,920
(Thirty-first year of Chunxi's reign)

316
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:25,964
(Royal Examination.
Ways to promote peace.)

317
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,680
(Thirty-first year of Chunxi's reign)

318
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,620
(Royal Examination.
Ways to promote peace.)

319
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,239
I'll leave the royal examination
to the three of you.

320
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,079
Thank you, Your Lordship.

321
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,079
His Lordship has passed down his edict.

322
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,640
The examination will be held
on the Ninth of this month.

323
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,400
Senior Secretary Pei Youshuo,
Yan Shizhang the Duke of Liang,

324
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,800
and Minister Wang Liangde of Rite
would invigilate the examination.

325
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,239
It seems like we can't hide the matters

326
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,119
in Yongzhou from His Lordship.

327
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,839
I'm sure that His Lordship already knows

328
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,760
that Senior Secretary Pei is
on the Feng family's side.

329
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
It's also no secret in court

330
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,239
that the Feng family is on your side.

331
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,439
That's why

332
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,000
His Lordship let Duke of Liang

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,920
and Senior Secretary Pei be
the examiners.

334
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,920
Duke of Liang's daughter may be

335
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,359
Queen Baili's palace maid.

336
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,199
But everyone knows

337
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:34,880
that Miss Yan

338
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,079
will be married
to Prince Ju sooner or later.

339
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,439
I never intend

340
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,479
to keep the Feng family or Pei Youshuo

341
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,479
a secret from Father.

342
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,160
When I was young,

343
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,040
I once heard Father talk
about the way of a feudal lord.

344
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,439
As a feudal lord,

345
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,560
one shouldn't be open
about their talents.

346
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:54,800
Why would

347
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,520
Baili let Ju leave

348
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,680
the capital at this time?

349
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Tell Feng Qiwu

350
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,319
to be prudent
during the royal examination.

351
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,680
There shall be no mistake.

352
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:06,800
Yes, Your Highness.

353
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I shall take my leave.

354
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,719
Sirs,

355
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,439
please examine the examination topic

356
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,719
to see if it's properly sealed.

357
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,280
Official Pei,

358
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,760
we rode in the same carriage
all the way here.

359
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,319
There was no chance
of it being swapped at all.

360
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,119
I don't think

361
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,239
we need to examine it.

362
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,400
We must follow the rules anyway.

363
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,479
Here.

364
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,240
(Thirty-first year of Chunxi's reign.
Royal Examination)

365
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,959
There's no problem.

366
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,520
All right.

367
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,119
It's completely sealed.

368
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,239
Please place it in the cabinet.

369
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,121
(Thirty-first year of Chunxi's reign.
Royal Examination)

370
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,577
(Prince Chang's Residence)

371
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,319
Uncle De,

372
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:27,445
(Celebrate Prosperity and Respect)

373
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
do you think that woman tried
to fool me?

374
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,319
Does she really not know me,

375
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,760
or is she feigning ignorance?

376
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,520
I'll be frank

377
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,359
if you won't be upset.

378
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,160
When you had an attack,

379
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,239
you often had a distorted appearance.

380
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,280
So it's not surprising

381
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,119
that the lady can't recognize

382
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:50,119
what you normally look like.

383
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,520
Since that lady

384
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,000
didn't recognize you,

385
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,920
she wouldn't tell anyone

386
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,680
about your illness.

387
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:57,839
Your Highness,

388
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,839
how about we spare her life

389
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,640
for now?

390
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,079
It's better to be cautious.

391
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
Tell the men to rent a residence
nearby her residence

392
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
so we can monitor her.

393
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,439
Yes, Your Highness.

394
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,040
How far along are we?

395
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,079
We're 20 li away from the Imperial City.

396
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,090
(Imperial Palace of Dadong)

397
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,359
Your Majesty,

398
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,359
Prince Huang Chao was attacked
20 li away from the Imperial City.

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,640
What?

400
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,400
Dong Shufang.

401
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,640
(Dadong General, Dong Shufang)
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,760
I order you

403
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,439
to bring Prince Huang back safely.

404
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,040
I shall obey your order, Your Majesty.

405
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,079
Father,
what about the Six States banquet?

406
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,400
It shall go along as planned.

407
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,239
We shall wait at the palace.

408
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,599
Yes, Father.

409
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,209
(The Heir of Lord of Qingzhou,
Feng Xieyue)

410
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,014
(The Heir of Lord of Youzhou,
Hua Chunyuan)

411
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,488
(The Heir of Lord of Shangzhou,
Yang Muchi)

412
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:42,241
(The Heir of Lord of Beizhou, Yuchi Lie)

413
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,520
Report!

414
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,280
Your Majesty,

415
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,439
Prince Huang Chao is waiting
outside the palace.

416
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,079
Summon him in.

417
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,079
Yes, Your Majesty.

418
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,760
Summon Prince Huang Chao of Jizhou

419
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,040
for an audience!

420
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,520
I, Huang Chao, greet Your Majesty.

421
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:18,359
Long live the Emperor.

422
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,160
Prince Huang, please rise.

423
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,119
Thank you, Your Majesty.

424
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,119
Your Majesty,

425
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,359
I was delayed

426
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,199
because I was attacked outside the city.

427
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,640
I hope Your Majesty can forgive me.

428
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:34,160
You're loyal to your country.

429
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:35,920
So you've committed no crime.

430
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,479
I...

431
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,119
I've lost the Empyrean Token.

432
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,199
The Empyrean Token is missing?

433
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,359
I was attacked 20 li away from the city.

434
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,319
Someone has taken

435
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,640
the Empyrean Token.

436
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,439
Prince Huang,

437
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,040
do you know who's behind it?

438
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,359
The assailants wore black clothing
with their faces covered.

439
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,040
I was unable to identify them.

440
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,319
But the last troop was cavalry.

441
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,439
I don't think they're
from the martial arts world.

442
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,800
What do you mean by this?

443
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,680
If they're not
from the martial arts world,

444
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,479
don't tell me

445
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,760
other states did it?

446
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,160
I was only stating the facts.

447
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Why are you so anxious?

448
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,280
Is it because you're hiding something?

449
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,959
Don't slander me.

450
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,400
If it was as Prince Huang had said,

451
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,920
the person who snatched the token

452
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,760
must be fearless.

453
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,760
Are you suspecting us?

454
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,920
If the Yong did it,

455
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,359
why did we have to attack 20 li
from the Imperial City?

456
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,880
But if we see it this way,

457
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:42,319
I'm afraid the only one
who had to do it outside the city

458
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,400
would be from Beizhou,
which is located in the north.

459
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,160
You...

460
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,520
It's not the time to point fingers now.

461
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,599
What matters most is

462
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,479
to find the Empyrean Token.

463
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,160
Mr. Xieyue has a point.

464
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,359
The Empyrean Token is the world order.

465
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,800
The ones who dared to snatch
the Empyrean Token outside the city

466
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,359
must be recklessly bold

467
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,479
to attempt to rebel.

468
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,959
I hope all the Six States work together

469
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,479
to find out the person behind this.

470
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,760
Gentlemen,

471
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:29,000
is there anyone willing
to investigate this matter for me?

472
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,640
Your Majesty,

473
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,439
I was the one who lost the token.

474
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,439
I'm willing to make up
for my incompetence

475
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,439
and help Your Majesty investigate
this matter.

476
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:47,839
But

477
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,199
this matter concerns Six States.

478
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,880
I request
that Your Majesty draft a decree

479
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,880
so it's convenient for me
to do the investigation.

480
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,319
In that case,

481
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,119
I shall decree

482
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,560
that Six States assist
Prince Huang in this matter.

483
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,640
Other than that,

484
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,640
I shall bestow Prince Huang
with the Imperial Sword

485
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,439
so he can carry out his investigation.

486
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

487
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,439
Chief Feng said she'll be careful.

488
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,079
Your Highness, an emergency message
from the Imperial City.

489
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,199
Interesting.

490
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
They lost the Empyrean Token again.

491
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,920
This token was a fake one.

492
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,800
Even if Huang Chao returned it,

493
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,880
he wouldn't be able to explain himself.

494
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,640
It's better to lose it on his way there.

495
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,920
Do you mean

496
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,319
it was only an act by Huang Chao?

497
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,560
I just fear that the Six States
may not carry out

498
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,839
His Majesty's decree.

499
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
But with this decree,

500
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,560
Huang Chao could openly carry out

501
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,160
his investigation in the Six States.

502
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,880
As to ordering the lords and princes
of the other states,

503
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,359
that'll depend on his capabilities.

504
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,359
You can say Huang Chao has more strength

505
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,680
with Yu Wuyuan beside him.

506
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:29,280
Your Highness,
I think Chief Feng is great too.

507
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,880
If she can...

508
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
It's not a bad idea

509
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,680
to ally with the Feng family.

510
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,839
I, General Lin Lancang,
am at your service, Your Highness.

511
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,880
Please forgive me.

512
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,920
Rise.

513
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,760
You were only playing along with me.

514
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,119
Not only did you do no wrong,
but you've also rendered merits.

515
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,359
When we return to Jizhou,

516
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,760
I shall reward you handsomely.

517
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

518
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,880
I planned this out for you

519
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,079
to save Jizhou from disaster.

520
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,479
We've agreed to say

521
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:15,479
that people of the martial arts world
snatched it.

522
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,079
But why did

523
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,719
you change the plan?

524
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,640
I understand what you want.

525
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,119
You don't want the Six States
to be in chaos again

526
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,239
because of the Empyrean Token.

527
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,000
But we both know

528
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,479
that it's no longer possible.

529
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,719
Now,

530
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,640
I have the Emperor's decree.

531
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,920
It's more convenient for me
to take action now.

532
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:38,520
If you think the Six States

533
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,040
can live in harmony together,

534
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,119
you might as well come with me.

535
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,959
It'll depend on you

536
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:49,079
if we can fight through the Six States

537
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,400
and even the world with words.

538
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,319
So

539
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,599
even I was your pawn in your plan.

540
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,239
I'm giving you an opportunity.

541
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,160
If you succeed,

542
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,920
the world will be mine.

543
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,920
If you fail,

544
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,640
I'll dispatch my troops everywhere

545
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,560
to unite the Six States.

546
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,439
This world

547
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,800
will still be mine.

548
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,199
All right.

549
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,560
I can travel to Six States with you.

550
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,680
But you're coming to a place with me.

551
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:23,839
Where?

552
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:25,760
Mount Wu.

553
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:35,560
How did my arrangement proceed?

554
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,000
It's all arranged.

555
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,479
I've prepared

556
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,760
a huge gift for Prince Yongping

557
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,920
in this royal examination.

558
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:46,800
Come in.

559
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,000
I, candidate Song Sihan,
am here to pay my respect.

560
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,239
Greetings, Minister.

561
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:59,346
(Candidate, Song Sihan)

562
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:05,533
(Examination Hall, Yongzhou)

563
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,719
Candidate, Song Sihan.

564
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,800
Candidate, Xu Yuxin.

565
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,280
(Examination Hall)

566
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,359
Candidate, Wang Hui.

567
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:37,760
Wait.

568
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,599
Why is your inkstone so light?

569
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,359
I come from a poor family.

570
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,560
So I've been using this inkstone
for a long time.

571
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,239
It becomes lighter
after bumping it around.

572
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,400
Sir.

573
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,680
So that's the reason.
Here, take it back.

574
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,959
- Sir, please have mercy!
- Sir.

575
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:02,959
Sir, have mercy on me!

576
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,280
Sir, please spare me!

577
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,520
It's a serious offense to cheat
in Examination Hall.

578
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,599
Take him away!

579
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:08,959
Yes, sir!

580
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:11,040
Sir, please spare me! Have mercy on me!

581
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,400
Sir, please spare me!

582
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,222
(Examination Hall)

583
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,839
Sir!

584
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,719
Dear candidates,

585
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,439
if you have notes with you,

586
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,800
you better destroy them now.

587
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,359
Don't risk your life

588
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,719
over greed.

589
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,599
Let's continue!

590
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:29,800
Senior Secretary Pei,

591
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,040
this must be your tenth year

592
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,400
presiding over
the royal examination, right?

593
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,640
Now, we have a large number
of talents in Yong.

594
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,199
And you contributed

595
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:40,040
in every little way in this,
Senior Secretary Pei.

596
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,040
Duke of Liang, you're flattering me.

597
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,560
As they say,

598
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,480
(Senior Secretary of Yongzhou, Pei Youshuo)
we have to share His Lordship's worries

599
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,760
(Senior Secretary of Yongzhou, Pei Youshuo)
as his officials.

600
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,471
(Minister of Rite, Wang Liangde)
The royal examination is

601
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:50,680
a stepping stone for the candidates.

602
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,599
It concerns the fate
of these individuals

603
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:54,400
(Duke of Liang, Yan Shizhang)

604
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,680
and is also a rite for the nation
to select talents.

605
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,040
It's especially a crucial matter.

606
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,880
As the chief examiner today,

607
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,319
I hope Duke of Liang and Minister Wang

608
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,520
to assist me.

609
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,239
Senior Secretary Pei,
please rest assured.

610
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll definitely do my best
to assist you.

611
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,880
Official Pei, so will I.

612
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,640
You have my thanks.

613
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Sirs,

614
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,319
we have finished inspecting
all the candidates.

615
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,280
There were a total of six candidates
who tried to smuggle notes.

616
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
They've been sent
to the Ministry of Justice.

617
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,280
The rest of the candidates have entered
the Examination Hall.

618
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,599
All right. You can leave now.

619
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,319
(Select talents for the state
through scriptures.)

620
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:45,503
(Thirty-first year of Chunxi's reign.
Royal Examination)

621
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,520
(Select talents for the state
through scriptures.)

622
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,280
Sirs, please take a look at this.

623
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,959
The seal is intact.

624
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,199
Let's remove the seal
and start with the examination.

625
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,119
All right.

626
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,480
(Examination Hall)

627
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,047
(Examination Hall)

628
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,320
(Number 10, Class A. Number 11, Class A.
Number 12, Class A)

629
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,399
Greetings, Father.

630
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

631
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,479
Lanxi,

632
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,080
Queen Baili has been busy because of me.

633
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,719
But she often worries about your health.

634
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,360
So she has been praying for you

635
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,159
throughout the journey.

636
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,800
She didn't even rest
after she arrived at the palace.

637
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,040
She kept herself busy making
arrangements for you.

638
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,760
I called you here

639
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
to relieve her concern for you

640
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,800
and also to give you a chance

641
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,639
to thank her.

642
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,479
Thank you, Your Highness.

643
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,479
There are no outsiders here.

644
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,719
You can drop the formalities.

645
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,840
You may have suffered from near-drowning.

646
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,959
But you look a lot better now.

647
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,760
I've managed to escape death.
I suppose blessings will follow.

648
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:10,919
Since the drowning,

649
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
my health has been

650
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,000
better than ever.

651
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:15,479
I'm glad to hear that.

652
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:18,719
I can finally feel relieved
on behalf of the late queen.

653
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,560
Now that you've been granted
the title of Prince Yongping

654
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,800
and your health is better.

655
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,479
Shall we start preparing

656
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,399
for the selection of your wife?

657
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,760
She has a point there.

658
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,959
You've reached marriageable age.

659
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,199
You can start considering marriage.

660
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,239
Your Lordship.

661
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,000
Speaking of this,

662
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,040
I do have a good choice in mind.

663
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,320
Several days ago,

664
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,000
my niece, Jing, paid me a visit

665
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,040
to the palace.

666
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,239
She looks dignified, polite,
and tactful too.

667
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,159
She's indeed a nice girl.

668
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,919
It's natural for a man to marry.

669
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,360
Ladies from the Baili family
are naturally good.

670
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,239
But

671
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,679
it hasn't been long
since I was given this title,

672
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:04,159
and I haven't contributed
to the country yet.

673
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,479
If I marry in a rush,

674
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,360
the ministers may criticize me.

675
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,639
Could it be that you have
someone in your heart?

676
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,719
Is it Minister Feng of the Feng family?

677
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,479
I do know Minister Feng in private.

678
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,600
But she's first

679
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,560
the minister of Yongzhou,

680
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,639
and Feng Qiwu comes second to me.

681
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,239
I have no ulterior motives
for making friends with her.

682
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,639
It's all for Yong.

683
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
As for my marriage,

684
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,360
I'll let Father decide

685
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,159
after I've accomplished
some achievements.

686
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,919
I'm grateful
for Your Highness's kind intention.

687
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,479
Xi has a point.

688
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,320
I'll think

689
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,760
about this matter.

690
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,439
Did His Highness really say that?

691
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:03,919
That's the news I got from the palace.

692
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm only reporting as it is to you.

693
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,959
His Lordship summons His Highness
this morning.

694
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,399
A family was having a conversation.

695
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,639
Yet, this piece of news reached

696
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,080
me fairly quickly through you.

697
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,159
Tell me,

698
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
why do you think this happened?

699
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,639
Do you mean

700
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,919
these words are meant for you to know,

701
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,840
so it'll drive a wedge
between you and His Highness?

702
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,040
Queen Baili is using me

703
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,199
to test His Highness.

704
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,959
If His Highness didn't say that,

705
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,600
His Lordship would be suspicious.

706
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,879
Besides,

707
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,280
I'm His Highness's subject,
to begin with.

708
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,719
I turn to His Highness for help

709
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,280
for the sake of the Feng family.

710
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,959
You can leave now.

711
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,120
(Is this how you truly feel,
Prince Lanxi?)

712
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,760
She has been pretending
to be a loving mother for years.

713
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,479
It must be hard on her.

714
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,800
You've exposed yourself this time.

715
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,600
Queen Baili naturally knows

716
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,080
that you're fighting
to be the heir of Lord of Yongzhou.

717
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,679
She could only show
that she's the benevolent matriarch.

718
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,360
She can only hold you down

719
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,000
in terms of filial piety and customs.

720
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,639
You've gotten a lot smarter now.

721
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,520
After you fell into the water,

722
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,320
you've changed a lot.

723
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,320
You may treat us well

724
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,120
as before.

725
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,239
But you've never treated me
like this before.

726
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,120
I can feel

727
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,560
that Your Highness is kinder
than before,

728
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,239
and you smile more often now.

729
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,239
It's wonderful

730
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,800
to be happy.

731
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,439
Who's there?

732
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:05,600
Lu Shi.

733
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,479
Why did you answer them?

734
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,919
Martial Sister has repeatedly told us
to guard the door strictly.

735
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,840
But she didn't say
we couldn't answer the door.

736
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:15,120
We've been making so much noise here.

737
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,600
Everybody knows
there are people here.

738
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,439
Martial Sister is sleeping inside.

739
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Go and inform her of this.

740
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,120
All right.

741
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,560
Who's there?

742
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,120
My Young Master is Miss Feng's friend.

743
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,000
We are here to deliver something.

744
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,399
Which one?

745
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,879
It's...

746
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,919
My Young Master is also Hei's friend.

747
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,919
Open the door.

748
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,360
Wait for a while.

749
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,639
Get some to help out.

750
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:56,560
Hurry.

751
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,800
Come and help out.

752
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,080
Come on.

753
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:04,959
Here.

754
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,560
Here you go.

755
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,479
So much charcoal.

756
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,320
We can keep warm tonight.

757
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,280
It's delicious.

758
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,199
We've been taking vegetables.
I've finally tasted meat.

759
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,239
These quilts are so soft.

760
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
Our Martial Sister sure is popular.

761
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,320
She has such loyal friends everywhere.

762
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,879
You're right.

763
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,120
Gu Yu, try this.

764
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,040
It's delicious.

765
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,439
It's really good.

766
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,439
It's all right.

767
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:29,719
You can eat first.

768
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,080
It's really delicious.

769
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:33,639
Martial Sister!

770
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,679
- Martial Sister.
- Martial Sister.

771
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,520
Come and have something to eat.

772
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,239
Come here.

773
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:37,560
Miss Feng.

774
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,320
Young Master is waiting for you
at the entrance of the alley.

775
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,560
All right. Thank you.

776
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,520
Black Foxy!

777
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,040
Why didn't you go in?

778
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:10,600
Because you're the main character

779
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:11,679
for today.

780
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,080
Me?

781
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,560
Several days ago,

782
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,719
didn't you tell me

783
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,600
it was hard to be
the acting leader of the sect?

784
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:23,000
I told Zhong Li to send some things over

785
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,239
to do a favor for you

786
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,040
to win their hearts.

787
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,919
So you're the main character,

788
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:30,040
not your friend.

789
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:34,000
No wonder you could manage

790
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,239
Fountain Abode so well.

791
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:36,639
I'm impressed.

792
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,280
Fountain Abode had heard

793
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,840
that Master Bai
might have gone to Mount Wu.

794
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,520
I've sent some men to verify it.

795
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm guessing

796
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,520
that you'll be extending your stay here.

797
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:47,800
Yongzhou may be situated in the south,

798
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,520
but the winter here is extremely cold.

799
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,320
I've sent some quilts and charcoal.

800
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,040
It can help you go through the winter.

801
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:54,959
How did you manage to be so thorough?

802
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,320
You've done me so many favors.

803
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,520
How should I repay you?

804
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,360
It's only a small matter

805
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
that's not worth mentioning.

806
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,520
For you to take it seriously,

807
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,879
I find you different
