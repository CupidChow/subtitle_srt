20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,120
Your Lordship, you have been
terribly busy with court affairs lately.

21
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,319
It pains me

22
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,919
to see you tire yourself so.

23
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,239
I made some nourishing soup

24
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,959
to replenish and boost your health.

25
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,519
You're thoughtful, Baili.

26
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,760
Please have a seat and try it.

27
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,600
How does it taste?

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
It tastes just like it did back then.

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Back then,

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
I was still a prince.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,919
My late father wedded you to me.

32
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,240
This was the soup you made

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,080
on the first day
you joined the residence.

34
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,320
You still remember, Your Lordship.

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,520
Of course.

36
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,279
I also remember

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,559
that one year,
you insisted on coming along with me

38
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,759
to the hunting grounds
during the autumn hunt.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,279
You were almost run over
by my third brother's horse.

40
00:02:58,559 --> 00:02:59,279
When you returned,

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,639
you cried all night in my arms.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,919
Oh, why does Your Lordship

43
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,679
only remember
all the times I was a mess?

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,320
There was another time

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,039
when I caught a cold.

46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,839
You didn't sleep or eat

47
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:18,039
for three days and three nights.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
Do you still remember the first thing
you said to me

49
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,880
when I woke up?

50
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,919
I said,

51
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,960
"I'm starving,
and only now you're waking up."

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
That's right.

53
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,639
It was from that day onward

54
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,440
I started developing feelings for you.

55
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,320
I told myself

56
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,479
that I would treat you well.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,240
I wish to be with you forever as well,
Your Lordship.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
You're here with me now, aren't you?

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,559
Silly.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,520
Ju has suppressed the bandits.

61
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,720
Your Lordship's birthday banquet
will be held soon as well.

62
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,679
Perhaps...

63
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,160
I think it is not yet the right time

64
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,679
to name my heir.

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,600
I...

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,839
understand.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,399
Mother.

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,519
Ju.

69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,160
Mother.

70
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,959
Wasn't it supposed to be
another five days before your return?

71
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,799
You...

72
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,040
I heard you had fallen ill.

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,959
I came back in a hurry
because I was concerned.

74
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,200
But I worried it would be
against military protocol.

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,799
Hence I disguised myself.

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
Are you feeling better now, Mother?

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,640
My "illness" lies in my heart.

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,079
In your heart?

79
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,079
Did something happen?

80
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,399
You're all grown up now.

81
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
I won't keep this from you any longer.

82
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,920
They found out about what I did to Yige.

83
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,120
(Nux Vomica)

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,760
Your Highness!

85
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,200
What is the matter, Your Highness?

86
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,440
Someone! Quick!

87
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,880
Your Highness, the deed is done.

88
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,799
She is no more.

89
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,239
Feng Lanxi is collecting evidence.

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,720
He intends to testify against me
in court before everyone.

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,440
I would rather take my own life

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,359
than let that happen.

93
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,119
I will absolutely not drag you down.

94
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:43,160
What do you need me to do then, Mother?

95
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,239
Stage a coup.

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Have you ever considered

97
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,679
the consequences

98
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,320
if we failed, Mother?

99
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,040
Everything hinges on this one matter.

100
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:13,119
If I had not made the first move
back then,

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,720
you would be without a mother right now.

102
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,200
Do you think

103
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,279
the title of Heir
is firmly in your grasp now?

104
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,559
I tried to sound out your father,

105
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,079
but he refused to budge.

106
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,640
Besides,

107
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,920
you've been secretly
building your army

108
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,079
for fear of any sudden changes as well,
haven't you?

109
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,600
In the eyes of my father,

110
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,880
Feng Lanxi built the Fountain Abode.

111
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,119
He is outstanding.

112
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,480
I could never hold a candle to him.

113
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,839
Father is still in his prime.

114
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,480
If he changes his mind,

115
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,040
what can I use
to fight against Feng Lanxi?

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
I've only been building my own forces

117
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,160
to protect myself.

118
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,119
You did the right thing.

119
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,040
We cannot wait for alms.

120
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,640
We must seize the initiative
to gain power.

121
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:06,679
Mother.

122
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,720
I share the same sentiment.

123
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,519
Father's army
has been sent to the south.

124
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,440
I think now is our best chance.

125
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,399
However,

126
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,079
I will need your help
when the time comes.

127
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,519
You and I are of one heart.

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,720
Mother, I promise you

129
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,640
that I will not let you
be aggrieved in any way.

130
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,520
Feng Lanxi wants to avenge his mother.

131
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,520
My life is yours to protect.

132
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,359
Your Highness,
this is the list of officials

133
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,559
who plotted against Queen Yige.

134
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:21,120
(The 11th year
of the Chunxi Reign, Liu Xian)

135
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,408
(Medical Bureau Record,
Queen Yige suddenly fell ill...)

136
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,080
Duke Liang.

137
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,599
Today is Your Lordship's 50th birthday.

138
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:45,119
I wish that all Your Lordship's vision
will be realized soon.

139
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:48,039
May you rule the world and your wise reign
become a lasting legacy.

140
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,799
I hope it is as you say.

141
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:57,520
Isn't it about time for Feng Ju
to return to the capital?

142
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,200
A letter came from him yesterday.

143
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,119
He said he would return
to the palace before noon.

144
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,200
The Emperor of Dadong
just passed away recently.

145
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,377
(Respect and Esteem)

146
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,200
The banquet must be a muted affair.

147
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,880
I've already made the arrangements.

148
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,919
Some time ago,

149
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,919
I sent people to purchase Reishi
from Imperial City.

150
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,189
(Respect and Esteem)

151
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,359
They said
they saw Marquis Yongping there.

152
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,039
He went to the Imperial City?

153
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
He is the late emperor's nephew.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,080
I think he probably only went
to pay respects to his late uncle.

155
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,000
He didn't even say if he would return
for my birthday banquet.

156
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,159
He has been out there for so long.

157
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,239
Yet, he thinks of his uncle,
who is thousands of miles away.

158
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,520
It would seem he is closer
to the Imperial Family, after all.

159
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,200
Your Highness.

160
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,479
Are the people outside the city ready?

161
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,760
Yes, Your Highness.

162
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,200
Once the banquet begins,

163
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,840
they will raid the capital

164
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,479
and head straight to the palace.

165
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,479
Good.

166
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
What about the evidence
I had you prepare?

167
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,359
I've prepared them as well.

168
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,640
All the evidence

169
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
will point to Feng Lanxi.

170
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,239
It all comes down to this.

171
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,000
There is no room for mistakes.

172
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:17,880
Understood.

173
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,880
This time,

174
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,039
I want everyone to know

175
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,400
that I

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,840
will be

177
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,919
the one to have the last laugh.

178
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,039
Your Highness will get what you desire.

179
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,200
How dare you, Feng Lanxi!

180
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,400
Are you trying to revolt?

181
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,599
How dare you take me captive!

182
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,520
I am the duke!

183
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,840
Twenty-one years ago,
on the 9th day of the 8th lunar month,

184
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,359
heavy rain poured
in the capital of Yongzhou.

185
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,760
You, Minister Wang,
the then Noble Consort Baili,

186
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,359
the current Minister of Revenue,
and Vice Minister of War,

187
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,400
conspired

188
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,039
to use the Nux Vomica

189
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,119
to kill Queen Yige.

190
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,719
Lies and slander!

191
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,320
Is that so?

192
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,320
Do you recognize this, Duke Liang?

193
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,840
This was the secret letter
the then Noble Consort Baili

194
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,880
sent to you back then.

195
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,200
You ordered them to get rid of it.

196
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,520
But your subordinate

197
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,039
secretly kept it

198
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,919
to protect themselves.

199
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,799
Duke Liang.

200
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,239
Do you know why I brought you here now?

201
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,880
Then you can present your case
and testify directly in court.

202
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,640
Why did you bring me here?

203
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,479
Are you planning to execute me yourself?

204
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,599
Yongzhou was weak at that time.

205
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,119
It needed the support
of the Imperial Family.

206
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,000
My mother tried her best
to mediate between both of them.

207
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,400
It was a boon for Yongzhou,

208
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,679
and she did not
pose a threat to any of you.

209
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,599
Why did you plot against her?

210
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,359
Queen Yige was a member
of the Imperial Family of Dadong.

211
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,000
(Room of Serenity)

212
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,119
At the time, we used her to cement
our ties with the Imperial Family.

213
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,520
After that, Yongzhou prospered
and reached its peak.

214
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,400
So long as she is alive,

215
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,119
Yongzhou will forever be tied down

216
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:57,880
by the declining Imperial Family.

217
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,880
We would never be able
to conquer the world.

218
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,679
If she didn't die,

219
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,000
there would be no doubt

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
as to who would become the Heir.

221
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,880
Was my father aware

222
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,799
of all of this?

223
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,799
As subjects,

224
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,039
we need only carry out our duties.

225
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,039
We do not have to report everything

226
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,960
to His Lordship.

227
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,479
Did you hear everything, Official Zhang?

228
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,880
Yes, Your Highness.

229
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,159
Duke Liang is suspected
of plotting against the late queen.

230
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,840
It is a crime equivalent
to conspiracy to commit rebellion.

231
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,440
Every word he said has been recorded.

232
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,320
Your Highness!

233
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,679
Have mercy, Your Highness!

234
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,880
If you admit your crimes
and plead guilty in court,

235
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,320
I can spare the lives of your family.

236
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

237
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,479
Your Highness!

238
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,320
Terrible news, Your Highness!

239
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,400
Prince Ju intends to revolt.

240
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,880
What?

241
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,440
According
to the Fountain Abode's findings,

242
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,719
the unrest in the south
wasn't caused by bandits.

243
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,239
It was all Prince Ju's ploy.

244
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,520
The "suppression"

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,239
is only a sham.

246
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,440
These bandits are the troops

247
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,080
he has been raising in secret.

248
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,440
Zhong Li,

249
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,119
go and get Du Xian.

250
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,559
Bring Duke Liang with you.

251
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:08,880
Be on standby.

252
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:09,640
Yes, Your Highness.

253
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,559
Come on.

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,559
All those men and horses.

255
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,400
Such an extensive migration.

256
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:20,000
Did the cities along the way
not notice anything at all?

257
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,960
These people

258
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,880
came all the way
from Zhangcheng and Xiaocheng.

259
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,479
If they were promised
favors and rewards,

260
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,799
the governors

261
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,000
would just keep one eye shut.

262
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,799
What's more,
the person giving the orders

263
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,599
is the destined heir
of Lord of Yongzhou, Feng Ju.

264
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,719
Your Highness,

265
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,440
this is a matter of utmost urgency.

266
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,960
We must head to the palace

267
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,919
and alert His Lordship at once.

268
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:37,640
Let's go.

269
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,400
Your Highness!

270
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,880
Your Highness.

271
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
I ran into Zhao Hai,

272
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,719
the head of the Royal Army,
on my way to the palace.

273
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,440
For some reason,

274
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,039
the Royal Army was replaced
by the city defense garrison.

275
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,640
Are the men of the city defense garrison
Minister Wang's?

276
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,760
Exactly.

277
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,520
Feng Ju is plotting a rebellion.

278
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,799
Prince Ju?

279
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
He already had this in mind

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,080
when he was gathering his troops.

281
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,640
But

282
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
the majority of the capital's troops

283
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,479
have been moved out.

284
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,880
It's impossible to recall them

285
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,719
in such a short amount of time.

286
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,760
Prince Ju's men

287
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,320
have already entered the capital.

288
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,239
What should we do now?

289
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
The closest city

290
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,080
that can help us solve this

291
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,320
is Yancheng.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,119
The Feng family's army fought with
my ancestors at the northern frontier.

293
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,119
After that, they were stationed

294
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,520
at Yancheng as a secret army.

295
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,000
All for the sake

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,919
of rescuing the capital in time

297
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:29,799
for an event such as this.

298
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,119
Father is in the palace right now.

299
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,056
It isn't possible to retrieve

300
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:32,960
the commander's tally
for the Feng family's army.

301
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,599
I'll have to trouble you

302
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,359
to head to Yancheng personally.

303
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
I'll go with Qiwu.

304
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,239
I'll protect her.

305
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,000
All right.

306
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,280
Be careful.

307
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,280
Yes, Your Highness.

308
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,440
Official Zhang.

309
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,280
Come with me to the palace.

310
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:52,960
Yes, Your Highness.

311
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:12,840
I wish you a blessed birthday, Father.

312
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,400
Long live the Lord.

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,919
Long live the Lord.

314
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,919
Everyone.

315
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,280
Yongzhou owes its prosperity

316
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:27,520
to all of you.

317
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,840
I raise a toast to all of you and Yongzhou.

318
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,599
Thank you, Your Lordship.

319
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,280
Chang?

320
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,799
Report!

321
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,719
Your Lordship, the city is under siege.

322
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,440
What? Under siege?

323
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,970
(Yongning Palace)

324
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,199
There is a large number of soldiers

325
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,160
heading to the capital right now.

326
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,479
We estimate at least 30,000 in number.

327
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,359
Whose flag do they carry?

328
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,839
The flag of Marquis Yongping.

329
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,839
Marquis Yongping, Feng Lanxi?

330
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,920
Go and find out more!

331
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:23,760
Yes, Your Lordship.

332
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,959
Your Lordship, does Marquis Yongping
intend to force you to abdicate?

333
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,199
This is a revolt!

334
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,359
Men!

335
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,119
Where are my men?

336
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,160
Wang Zuo! What is the meaning of this?

337
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,199
Your Lordship.

338
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,959
This is to protect Your Lordship

339
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,560
and everyone else here.

340
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,560
Your Lordship,
there is something unusual about this.

341
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,199
Why would Marquis Yongping
send his troops to the palace?

342
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,040
It doesn't make sense at all.

343
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
He invaded with troops.

344
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,199
He must be after the throne.

345
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,280
Would someone like that

346
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:20,800
blatantly show off their flags?

347
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,000
How can we be sure that it is him?

348
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,040
Your Lordship, this matter
requires further consideration.

349
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,719
Your Lordship.

350
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,880
This is not the time to discuss this.

351
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,040
Marquis Yongping came prepared.

352
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,479
The capital is short of military forces.

353
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,079
I fear our chances of success are slim.

354
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,680
I am willing to assist you, Father.

355
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,199
The city is surrounded by the army.

356
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:49,040
I am willing to break out
of the city and seek reinforcements.

357
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,000
I believe that is our best option.

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,680
However, I will require
your commander's tally

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,520
to seek reinforcements, Father.

360
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,680
Your Lordship,
this is a matter of grave urgency.

361
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,920
You mustn't hesitate.

362
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,839
Your Lordship! You mustn't hesitate!

363
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,640
Yuan Lu.

364
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,839
Bring me the commander's tally.

365
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,239
Your Lordship...

366
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,119
Go.

367
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:19,680
Yes, Your Lordship.

368
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,599
Ju.

369
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,520
You know the weight of this tally.

370
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:59,280
Know well what you should

371
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,199
and shouldn't do.

372
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:04,719
I will not let you down, Father.

373
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,400
Your Lordship, Ju is but a prince.

374
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,280
The commander's tally alone might not...

375
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,280
Father.

376
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
If you do not name me as your heir,

377
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,239
I'm afraid

378
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,680
this tally won't be put to much use.

379
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,319
Yuan Lu.

380
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,319
Yes, Your Lordship.

381
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,319
Draft the decree.

382
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,719
The traitorous Feng Lanxi
attempted to stage a coup.

383
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,920
Prince Feng Ju
defended the nation loyally.

384
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,479
He shall be crowned my heir.

385
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,959
Thank you, Father.

386
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,439
Who is revolting?

387
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,319
I ask that you investigate
the matter clearly, Father!

388
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:13,680
Seize him!

389
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:19,599
Wait!

390
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,439
You've got some guts
to show your face here

391
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,000
after leading your army
to revolt, Feng Lanxi.

392
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,680
Who exactly is the one

393
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:29,680
plotting a rebellion?

394
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,920
And who owns the 30,000 troops outside?

395
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,160
Surely, you know the answer, Feng Ju.

396
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
You have come so far,

397
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
and you are still trying to turn
Father and me against each other?

398
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,160
Official Zhang!

399
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,319
Your Lordship.

400
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,640
I have already obtained evidence

401
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,439
that proves the rebels

402
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,560
were acting under the command

403
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,439
of Prince Ju

404
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,920
with the intention
to frame Marquis Yongping.

405
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,000
Zhang Zhongge!

406
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,199
To think

407
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,199
even you have been
bought off by Feng Lanxi.

408
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,920
Minister Wang, I serve His Lordship.

409
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,839
I will not be bought by anyone.

410
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,400
I can't say the same for you.

411
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,199
You replaced the Royal Army
with the city defense garrison today.

412
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,160
What exactly were your intentions?

413
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,560
I did this for His Lordship's safety.

414
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,741
Your Lordship,

415
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:19,839
(Rebellion Operation)
I have the proof in my hands.

416
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,280
Please examine it.

417
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,560
- Bring it...
- Evidence?

418
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,439
You guys must have made it up.

419
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,560
Your Lordship will know
if this evidence is true

420
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,199
once you examine it.

421
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,119
No need to waste time.

422
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,520
Defeat the enemy
by capturing the leader.

423
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,599
Seize Feng Lanxi,
and the city will be freed.

424
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,479
Get them!

425
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,040
You have recovered your skills?

426
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,800
Afraid now?

427
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,199
Please read this, Father.

428
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,880
Father, you mustn't fall for his lies!

429
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,199
This is all part of his scheme!

430
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,760
Silence!

431
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,800
How dare you, Feng Ju!

432
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,359
Father, I...

433
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,520
Your Highness.

434
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,040
Since your plot has been exposed,

435
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,119
there is no turning back.

436
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,680
Your army is seizing the city outside,

437
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,239
and you have us to support you here.

438
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,880
What are you afraid of?

439
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,560
Don't tell me you want

440
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,040
to return the military power
that is in your possession.

441
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,439
You mustn't let everything be in vain.

442
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,640
Father.

443
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,520
I had only wanted

444
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,199
to procure the title of Heir

445
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
and gain control over the military.

446
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,640
But I can't be blamed

447
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,640
for what happens now.

448
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,239
Lanxi.

449
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,839
Seize this insolent bastard for me!

450
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,040
Yes, Father.

451
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,479
Do it!

452
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,119
You said one should capture
the leader to defeat the enemy.

453
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,760
Seize him, and the city will be freed.

454
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,040
Isn't that right?

455
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,280
Defend the main hall!

456
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,479
Charge!

457
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,520
Report!

458
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,719
Your Lordship,

459
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,760
apart from the main gate of the north,

460
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,119
all other gates have been broken.

461
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,160
The rebels
have advanced into the palace.

462
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,199
Feng Lanxi.

463
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,560
My army is outside.

464
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,359
Even if you manage to capture me,

465
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,640
do you think
you can still get out of this?

466
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,319
Your Lordship need only issue an order

467
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,839
for the execution
of the criminal, Feng Lanxi,

468
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,079
and Prince Ju and I

469
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,800
will solve this crisis.

470
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,680
The fate of Yongzhou

471
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,119
still lies in Your Lordship's hands.

472
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:24,959
Wang Zuo,

473
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,199
I have always treated you well.

474
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,520
Why are you doing this?

475
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,520
Because he is the most well-hidden spy

476
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,520
sent from Jizhou.

477
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,920
Am I right, Minister Wang?

478
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,160
As expected of Marquis Yongping.

479
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,479
You even found me out.

480
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Minister Wang,
you are a spy from Jizhou?

481
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:54,959
Your Highness,
I did do this to help you.

482
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,959
If Your Highness
could inherit the throne,

483
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,560
Jizhou could form a non-aggression pact

484
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,839
with Yongzhou.

485
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,280
You heard him, Feng Ju.

486
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:07,800
You have been deluded!

487
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:15,760
Father,

488
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,839
I have never allowed myself
to be deluded.

489
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,719
Now that it has come to this,

490
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,800
I might as well
make all of you realize this.

491
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,160
The reason why I did all of this

492
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
is because of Feng Lanxi.

493
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,199
Feng Lanxi,

494
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,599
you are just too good.

495
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,000
Even though
you've been expelled from Yongzhou,

496
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,239
should you decide to come back someday,

497
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,760
there is no way for me
to compete against you.

498
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,560
If I don't do this,

499
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,439
I will be trampled
under your feet for the rest of my life.

500
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:45,920
Father,

501
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,839
you shouldn't think

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,760
Feng Lanxi came back just to save you.

503
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,800
The reason he came back without notice

504
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,119
is that he was investigating something.

505
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,920
And he must keep that thing

506
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,319
a secret from you.

507
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,400
Because he suspects you as well!

508
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,719
What is it, Lanxi?

509
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,599
I wish to prosecute Queen Baili
for conspiring with Minister Wang,

510
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,920
Duke Liang, and the others

511
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,400
to poison and assassinate
the late queen.

512
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,199
I have evidence and witnesses.

513
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,719
I ask for your wise judgment, Father!

514
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,439
What? Is that true?

515
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,079
Lately,

516
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,280
I have been investigating
and collecting evidence.

517
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,280
Because this concerns
not only matters of the harem

518
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,599
but also court affairs.

519
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,239
I wanted to secure sufficient evidence

520
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
before reporting the matter to you.

521
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,800
You make it sound so sensible.

522
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,319
But in actuality,
you just suspected Father

523
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,239
of being involved
in your mother's murder as well.

524
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,959
I harbored no such thoughts!

525
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,359
You killed Yige?

526
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,599
How could I become queen
if she was alive?

527
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,359
And how could my son become the Heir?

528
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,359
Your Lordship,
now that it has come to this,

529
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,119
you should just abdicate.

530
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:26,959
Archers!

531
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,040
You have been blinded by greed.

532
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,359
As a prince,

533
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,800
you attempted to revolt!

534
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,760
How can you do this

535
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,199
to all the innocent warriors
who died protecting Yongzhou?

536
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,959
Die, Feng Lanxi!

537
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,239
For your selfish ambitions,

538
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,160
you disrupted peace and caused unrest.

539
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,599
You have disgraced the world.

540
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,479
It is time to make you
come to your senses!

541
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,839
Ju!

542
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,880
Ju! Ju!

543
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,439
Ju! Ju...

544
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,119
You can't kill me, Feng Lanxi.

545
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,319
Neither would you dare.

546
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,560
- Because...
- Because if you died,

547
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,319
someone outside

548
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,280
would set off
the explosives you planted.

549
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,239
Father.

550
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
I've disposed of all the gunpowder

551
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,400
around the palace at Lanxi's request.

552
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:43,640
Great.

553
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,920
I will give you credit
and reward you well, Feng Chang.

554
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,800
Even so,

555
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,719
I doubt you guys can handle

556
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,400
the troops outside the hall.

557
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,079
The leader of the rebels has fallen!

558
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,040
Surrender now!

559
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,479
Put down your weapons!

560
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,199
Come with me to the hall.

561
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,520
There are wounded soldiers here.

562
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,520
Leave this to me.

563
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,920
All right.

564
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,079
Your Lordship,
sorry for being late to protect you.

565
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,479
The leader of the rebels
has been executed on the spot.

566
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,319
The rebels have surrendered.

567
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,400
Great.

568
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,199
Seize Feng Ju, Baili,

569
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,680
and the traitor,
Wang Zuo, immediately!

570
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,000
Father.

571
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,319
I have brought Du Xian and Duke Liang.

572
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,079
The evidence and witnesses are all here.

573
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,439
Please make your decision, Father.

574
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,560
Your Lordship! It was him!

575
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,199
Him!

576
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,719
We were deceived and taken advantage of

577
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,079
by him!

578
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,520
He deserves to die!

579
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,880
Your Highness,

580
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,760
you jest.

581
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,359
I wouldn't have been able
to add fuel to the fire

582
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,199
if you hadn't wanted the same.

583
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,079
It was you!

584
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,400
You!

585
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,839
You wanted me to poison Yige!

586
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:40,959
From the beginning,

587
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,640
it was you who dragged me down.

588
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,599
Once Feng Lanxi got the evidence,

589
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,160
you exhorted me to stage a coup!

590
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,640
It was you! It was all you!

591
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,680
Enough!

592
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:51,959
Do you not even feel

593
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,319
the slightest bit of guilt
towards Queen Yige?

594
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,199
Your Lordship, everything is my fault.

595
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
Ju is innocent.

596
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,800
He recruited troops, raised an army,

597
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,439
and invaded the capital of Yongzhou.

598
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,959
He was forcing me
to abdicate the throne earlier.

599
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,319
How could he possibly be innocent?

600
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,800
Father.

601
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,079
I have nothing else to say.

602
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,359
I feel gratified today.

603
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,760
All these years, I've been so meek

604
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,319
and careful before you.

605
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,439
I don't even dare to let out a breath.

606
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,040
If I made even the slightest mistake,

607
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,920
I would have to endure your wrath.

608
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,079
I've had enough

609
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,319
of a life like that.

610
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,280
You are my son.

611
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,280
Everything I did was for your own good.

612
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,839
For my good?

613
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,319
I'm afraid I can't endure your "care".

614
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,839
Look at your other son.

615
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,760
He did everything for you.

616
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,079
And what did you do for his "good"?

617
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,920
You rendered
his martial arts skills useless

618
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,119
and chased him out of Yongzhou!

619
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:10,000
All because he was too capable.

620
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,040
You were afraid
he would take the throne from you!

621
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,239
Nonsense!

622
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
You can discuss and debate
the rules and laws

623
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,800
of a relationship
between a father and a son

624
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,359
and a lord and his subject.

625
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,439
But those can never justify
committing murder and a rebellion!

626
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,319
Feng Lanxi,

627
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,800
you are too sanctimonious.

628
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,719
I refuse to believe

629
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,119
that you've never wanted

630
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,680
to put everyone beneath you!

631
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,520
To make all of those

632
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,199
who mocked you, wronged you,

633
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,800
shamed you, and persecuted you

634
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,760
submit to you!

635
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,079
And

636
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,400
this father of yours
who never showed you any care.

637
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:48,359
All he cares about
are his throne and power.

638
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,040
He even suspects his own sons!

639
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:53,680
If he cared about you in the slightest,

640
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,359
it wouldn't have taken you until now

641
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,439
to find out the real reason
your mother died!

642
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,599
And you never hated him?

643
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,400
Are you finished?

644
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,280
Take him away!

645
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,439
Take all of them away!

646
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,320
Mother.

647
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,800
What took you so long, Eunuch Yuan?

648
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,959
Ju has returned to get ready.

649
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,399
I'm ready as well.

650
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,840
Eunuch Yuan,
this must be the royal decree.

651
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:29,600
"Today,

652
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,520
Queen Baili

653
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,000
and Prince Feng Ju

654
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
conspired with Prime Minister Wang Zuo
and committed treason.

655
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,840
Queen Baili poisoned
the late queen, Her Highness Queen Yige.

656
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,159
Her crimes are unforgivable.

657
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,840
She shall be given white silk
to end her life.

658
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,639
Prince Feng Ju
will be relegated to a commoner.

659
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,360
That is all."

660
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,239
Is there a mistake, Eunuch Yuan?

661
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:03,000
This is supposed to be a decree
that names Ju as His Lordship's heir.

662
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,320
Please end your own life,

663
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,040
Your Highness.

664
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,520
Mother.

665
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,439
Father showed grace.

666
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,919
He allowed me to see you
one last time before I left.

667
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:30,879
It appears

668
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,560
that he still cares about us.

669
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,560
I think it's not a bad thing

670
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,207
that I didn't become

671
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:40,600
his heir.

672
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,280
At least I'm free of worries.

673
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,280
What do you think?

674
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:50,840
Mother?

675
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,679
Mother?

676
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,199
Mother...

677
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,320
Mother...

678
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,439
Mother...

679
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:10,327
Greetings, Father.

680
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:12,959
Rise.

681
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,280
Come forth.

682
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:21,719
Sit here.

683
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,040
Come on.

684
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:36,679
Last night,

685
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,719
I couldn't get a wink of sleep.

686
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,800
Did you sleep well?

687
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,399
I

688
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,280
dreamed of Mother.

689
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,280
I wronged your mother.

690
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,360
I didn't show you much care either.

691
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,080
It's to be expected if you hold grudges

692
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,080
against me.

693
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,239
I have never held a grudge against you.

694
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,520
I know

695
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,000
that you are not just my father.

696
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,600
You are also the ruler of Yongzhou.

697
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,840
You are needed by too many.

698
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
I understand.

699
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,600
Sometimes,

700
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,919
you are too understanding.

701
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,639
So much

702
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,000
so that I feel like there is a distance

703
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,199
between us.

704
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,840
Never mind.

705
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,439
Now,

706
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,560
you are the only one 
who chould be my heir.

707
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,159
In the past,

708
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,000
I wanted to have everything in my grasp.

709
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:46,879
But in the end,

710
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,120
everything slipped through my palms.

711
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,120
I have decided

712
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,439
to entrust my throne to you.
