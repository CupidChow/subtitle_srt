=Episode 23=

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,400
What brings you here today,

21
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:49,759
Chancellor Ren?

22
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,400
To tell you honestly,

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,720
I came

24
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,640
to discuss the matter of Miss Fengxi.

25
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:58,759
Xi?

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,479
I've heard of the matter

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,999
between His Highness and Miss Fengxi.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,759
The Tianshuang Sect may be renowned,

29
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,720
but it is still a sect
of the martial arts world.

30
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,999
It would be difficult for Miss Fengxi

31
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,759
to marry His Highness.

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,880
Moreover,

33
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,079
I heard she is used

34
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,160
to a carefree life.

35
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:21,400
I believe

36
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,239
she wouldn't take well
to the lifestyle of the royal family.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,999
So you want me

38
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,120
to help separate them.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,999
If they carry on with things,

40
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:36,200
nothing good will come out of it.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,079
It is better to plan ahead.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,039
It is for their good as well.

43
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,960
What do you think, Master Bai?

44
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,640
I am aware

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,999
of what you mean, Chancellor Ren.

46
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,600
However,

47
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,680
I cannot control what she does.

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
We should leave the young ones

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,640
to settle

50
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,880
their own matters.

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,759
Master Bai.

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,039
You are a leader of a sect, after all.

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,479
Are you just going to sit idly by?

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,880
What you're saying

55
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,519
is that my disciple

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,160
is not good enough for Prince Yongping

57
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,720
because she is a member
of the martial arts world.

58
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,239
These are my words for you.

59
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,400
You

60
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,120
need not worry.

61
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,519
Miss Fengxi might be famous

62
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,559
in the martial arts world,

63
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,200
but within the court...

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
Pardon my bluntness.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,200
No matter how heroic
or powerful she is out there,

66
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,160
she is but a civilian.

67
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,079
That is all from me.

68
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,559
I hope you will reconsider, Master Bai.

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,479
Farewell.

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,840
(I can't believe
he was trying to confess to me.)

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Martial Sister, you're finally back.

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,000
What's the matter? You look unhappy.

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,439
What happened?

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,560
Um... Today...

75
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,640
Chancellor Ren from Mr. Feng's faction

76
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,039
came by today.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,799
His tone was unpleasant.

78
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,439
He wanted Master to discipline you

79
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,640
and have you cut off ties with Mr. Feng.

80
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,200
How was Master?

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,280
He's fine. He rejected the idea.

82
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,119
But are you...

83
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm all right.

84
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:45,879
Please, don't do anything reckless.

85
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,720
We should think this through.

86
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,640
Don't worry.

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,959
I'll handle it with care.

88
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:57,800
Let's go.

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,679
Miss Fengxi.

90
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,200
Zhong Li.

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,399
His Highness wants to meet you
by the river on the Lantern Festival night.

92
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,560
You must be there.

93
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,840
Don't stand him up again.

94
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,000
(It seems he doesn't know about it yet.)

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Sure, I got it.

96
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,920
(Chancellor Ren's Residence, Yongzhou)

97
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:23,759
Sir,

98
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:26,039
a guest outside wants you
to have this box.

99
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
She says you will see her
once you take a look inside.

100
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,360
Open it.

101
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:36,754
(Nimbus)

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
Nimbus Liquor?

103
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,640
Who sent this precious gift?

104
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,640
Let her in.

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,519
Yes.

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Greetings, Chancellor Ren.

107
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,160
Miss Fengxi, it didn't take you long.

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,479
Since you brought this gift here,

109
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,679
I want you to take it back.

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,239
Wait, Chancellor Ren.

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,519
Do you know about this liquor?

112
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,119
It's as clear as water

113
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,879
and smooth as a flowing nimbus.

114
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,679
Thus, the name.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,679
Indeed.

116
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,039
It's said that after tasting this liquor,

117
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,640
the person will feel as though
they are walking among the clouds

118
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,879
and carried by the gale.

119
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,399
It's also called the Liquor of Gale.

120
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,640
Do you know

121
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,119
where this liquor originated from?

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,679
It's said Old Taiyin of Mount Wu
brewed the liquor personally.

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,239
There is only a handful of
this liquor in the entire world.

124
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,720
It's thoughtful of you

125
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,000
to send me this precious gift.

126
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,280
I didn't come here

127
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
only to send you a gift.

128
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,119
There are some matters
that I can't wrap my mind around.

129
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,080
You are a high-ranking official
of Yongzhou.

130
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,720
You've seen your fair share
of the world.

131
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
I brought you the liquor

132
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,679
so you could clear some of my doubts.

133
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,599
Speak away.

134
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:47,880
My doubts

135
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,359
are with the liquor.

136
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,440
You must know about

137
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,160
Lanxi's trip to Mount Wu.

138
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,399
This liquor

139
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,880
was a reward given to us

140
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,720
after we survived
many dangerous encounters.

141
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,560
Tell me,

142
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,840
how many people in this world

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,480
can brave the perilous trials

144
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,199
with Prince Lanxi?

145
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,959
Whether it's your love for him

146
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
or your marriage,

147
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:15,519
it's always the parents' duty
to arrange their children's marriage.

148
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,560
The two families must come
from similar backgrounds

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
and treat each other with respect.

150
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,119
What has been may not always be right.

151
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
From what I see,

152
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,959
love is a matter

153
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,119
of doing what we love
with the person we love.

154
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,639
Life is short.

155
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,399
One shall be content

156
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,840
with having a soulmate.

157
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,239
Now, my second doubt.

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,440
Do you

159
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,399
find my thoughts reasonable

160
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,320
or nonsensical?

161
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,679
Your thoughts are justified.

162
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
But as a subordinate,

163
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,560
reminding His Highness
to be mindful of his circumstances

164
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,079
is my responsibility.

165
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,560
Speaking of circumstances...

166
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,639
I'm just a normal person.

167
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,799
I've spent years wandering the land.

168
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,919
I've come to realize

169
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,519
that nothing lasts forever.

170
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,399
When one dynasty falls,

171
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,760
another takes its place.

172
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,320
The Dadong Empire is falling apart.

173
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,199
Do you think

174
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,799
Yongzhou is capable

175
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,440
of maintaining its status quo

176
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,679
among the Six States?

177
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,639
Do you think Prince Lanxi
could use a marriage of convenience

178
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
to secure his place as the heir of Lord?

179
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,280
That is my last doubt.

180
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,679
Pardon me,

181
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,639
I cannot answer your doubts.

182
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,000
However, I will consider what you said.

183
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,320
Very well.

184
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,959
In that case,

185
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
I'll take my leave now.

186
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,040
Keep the liquor.

187
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,639
(Miss Fengxi)

188
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:43,079
(is knowledgeable with
matters of the world.)

189
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,639
(She lives up to her reputation.)

190
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,239
(I have overstepped the line this time.)

191
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,760
Your Highness, I went to the courtyard
and passed the message.

192
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,239
Did she say yes?

193
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,480
Miss Fengxi seemed to be in a hurry.

194
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,359
Perhaps she had matters to see to.

195
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,199
She asked me to leave.

196
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,720
She didn't really

197
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,239
give an answer.

198
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

199
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,199
The agent I sent after her

200
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,399
says she headed for
Chancellor Ren's residence.

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,519
She went to Mentor's residence?

202
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:43,760
Yes.

203
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,199
Your Highness.

204
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,760
I came to apologize.

205
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
Why do you apologize?

206
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,959
For the good of Your Highness' future,

207
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,119
I had gone to the courtyard

208
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,679
and warned Master Bai
to restrain his disciple

209
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,639
from bothering you.

210
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,440
A vagabond of the martial arts world
and a noble prince of the royal family

211
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,079
do not belong together.

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,679
How dare you!

213
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,399
I took the matter into my own hands.
It was wrong of me to do so.

214
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,519
However, it concerns
Your Highness' marriage.

215
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,119
The late Queen entrusted you to me.

216
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
I can't allow you
to ruin your own future.

217
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,079
My mother's trust

218
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,560
doesn't give you the right to do so!

219
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,600
I've told you,

220
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,399
no one must interfere
with matters of Bai Fengxi.

221
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,280
Mentor,

222
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,560
have you forgotten everything?

223
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,000
I will never forget that.

224
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
But she is a civilian.

225
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,720
Compared with
Your Highness' noble status,

226
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,560
she is not unworthy.

227
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:51,880
On top of that,

228
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,919
Your Highness hasn't been
selected as His Lordship's heir.

229
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,040
If I refuse to obey you,

230
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
you might try to justify your nonsense!

231
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,480
I wouldn't dare.

232
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,480
It's wrong for a subordinate
to disobey a direct order.

233
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
I am willing to accept your punishment.

234
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,439
Mentor, you have never been so reckless.

235
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,519
Who instigated you into doing this?

236
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:47,240
Mentor, you may go now.

237
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,040
Your Highness.

238
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,519
I will go now.

239
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,199
Huan.

240
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,639
Tomorrow morning,

241
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,360
leave the residence.

242
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,999
Your Highness, I was wrong.

243
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,879
I shouldn't have gone behind your back.

244
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,439
But, I did it for you!

245
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:26,040
That's why...

246
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,559
Enough!

247
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,959
Spare me your excuses.

248
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,160
Your action

249
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
was nothing short of treason.

250
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,599
Your Highness.

251
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,199
Please forgive me!

252
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,920
I have no place

253
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,399
in the world outside.

254
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,639
All I ask is to let me stay.

255
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,279
That's all I'll ask.

256
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,199
Zhong Li, get her out of here.

257
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
Give her 100 golden leaves.

258
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,159
Send her home.

259
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,600
Come on.

260
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,440
Do you like this?

261
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,839
I didn't know my mentor

262
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,319
had visited your residence.

263
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,959
I apologize on his behalf.

264
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,839
Did you ask me out

265
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,240
just to apologize for his action?

266
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:13,680
By the way,

267
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,600
it's a custom in Yongzhou

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,560
to watch the lanterns.

269
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:17,800
It smells great!

270
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,159
Can you smell it?

271
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,360
The scent is nice.

272
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,120
Look over there.

273
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,360
(I seek only to have your heart.)

274
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,440
(I seek only to have your heart.)

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Did you prepare this?

276
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,880
I asked you out

277
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,880
because I have something to tell you.

278
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,719
This is only part of it.

279
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,759
And...

280
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,360
Your Highness.

281
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,519
Understood.

282
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
If it's urgent, you should see to it.

283
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,519
Your Highness, time is running short.

284
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Let's go.

285
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,639
That looks nice.

286
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,440
"I seek only to have your heart."

287
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,520
(I seek only to have your heart)

288
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,399
"Till the end do we part."

289
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,440
How thoughtful of you.

290
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,079
The high tide of spring
will soon arrive.

291
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,959
Yu Ming channeled the water to Qingzhou

292
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,079
to prevent a flood.

293
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,240
The heir of Lord of Qingzhou, Xieyue,

294
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,920
massed his troops
50 li outside Liangcheng.

295
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,480
Yu Ming is asking for aid.

296
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,040
What should we do about the situation?

297
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,639
I think

298
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,159
this is good news.

299
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,959
Liangcheng is a remote place.

300
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,279
Yu Ming massed an army
to secure his position.

301
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,120
I think we shouldn't aid him.

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
It's best to let them fight each other.

303
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,120
I disagree with the plan.

304
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,040
By doing so,

305
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,600
we may weaken Yu Ming's influence,

306
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
but the people of Liangcheng
will suffer greatly.

307
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
As far as I know,

308
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,279
Yu Ming's water canals

309
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,560
were built halfheartedly.

310
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,839
If they don't finish building the dam

311
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,680
before the spring tide,

312
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,240
Liangcheng might become flooded.

313
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,199
If we proceed with Minister Wang's plan,

314
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,880
both parties will suffer heavy losses.

315
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
What do you propose, Minister Qin?

316
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,519
I suggest

317
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,120
we send troops as reinforcements

318
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,360
and use this chance
to retake Liangcheng.

319
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,680
Minister Qin,

320
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,759
who do you think
is best suited for this task?

321
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,519
Your Lordship,
Prince Yongping is here to see you.

322
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,639
Let him in.

323
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,440
Greetings, Father.

324
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,880
Long live Your Lordship.

325
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,000
At ease.

326
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,560
Are you here because
of the trouble at Liangcheng?

327
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,560
Yes.

328
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
News travels fast.

329
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
What do you suggest?

330
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,839
I will go to Liangcheng

331
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,199
and resolve the situation.

332
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,360
How?

333
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,000
When I was at the Ministry of Work,

334
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,360
I studied how dams

335
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,839
were constructed.

336
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,800
I plan to build a dam

337
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,839
between the two cities

338
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,319
based on the terrain.

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,959
Please have a look.

340
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:12,880
Your Lordship,

341
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,519
if this dam is completed,

342
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,440
it can fend off an army of
100,000 strong.

343
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,319
It will also benefit the people.
The feat will be sung for generations.

344
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,240
That is a sound plan, Your Highness.

345
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,000
However,

346
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,920
His Highness' action was inadequate.

347
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,920
The princes must not leave the capital
or control garrison towns.

348
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,959
That was the rule set by the late lord.

349
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,959
Prince Yongping cares
about the people of Yongzhou,

350
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,240
but perhaps

351
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
he has his own agenda.

352
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,040
From what I see,

353
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:43,000
all the land in this state
belongs to Your Lordship.

354
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:46,440
Prince Yongping merely
plans to build a dam.

355
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,120
What could he be after?

356
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,519
Prince Yongping worked
at the Ministry of Work.

357
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,199
When there was a flood,

358
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,240
His Highness personally saw to
the building of the drainage system.

359
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,920
His Highness' plan

360
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,560
is for the greater good of Yongzhou.

361
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,959
Send out my words.

362
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,600
Prince Yongping shall
take 500 soldiers with him

363
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,319
and set out tomorrow morning.

364
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:13,760
I accept the order.

365
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,319
He's going to Liangcheng
for flood control?

366
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:17,679
Yes.

367
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,679
Why would Prince Yongping
go to that forsaken place?

368
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,120
To prevent the princes
from dividing the lord's power,

369
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,400
the late lord of Yongzhou set a rule

370
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,600
that only allows the princes
to rule from the capital.

371
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,880
But, His Lordship broke this rule

372
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,039
for Feng Lanxi

373
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,280
and gave him 500 soldiers.

374
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,439
That means

375
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,120
he alone has command
over the troops in Liangcheng.

376
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,280
But still,

377
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,439
the cunning Feng Lanxi
might not be a match

378
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,439
for the Military Commissioner

379
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,880
of Liangcheng

380
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,400
when it comes to military tactics.

381
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:57,639
(To Xiyun: The border between
Qingzhou and Yongzhou could be flooded.)

382
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,111
(Everything is fine at home.
Do not be worried. By Xieyue)

383
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,719
(Troops stationed at Liangcheng...)

384
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,240
(Trouble is brewing in Qingzhou.)

385
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:05,640
Xi.

386
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,760
Master.

387
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,880
You should be in bed.

388
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,039
Master, I must go to Liangcheng.

389
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,773
(Xi)

390
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,679
Go.

391
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,679
We will wait in the capital of Yongzhou.

392
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,120
Yes.

393
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
Miss Huan.

394
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,880
(Everlasting Prosperity and Peace)
I didn't expect you to send me off.

395
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,520
His Highness has left for Liangcheng.

396
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,400
He won't be returning
for quite some time.

397
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,960
His Highness especially delivered
a letter to me

398
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,640
asking me to find an opportunity

399
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,040
to see you depart from away
from the capital.

400
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,400
I know I've committed a grave mistake
and deserved to be punished.

401
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,560
Yet, His Highness is still concerned.

402
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,760
I have never left
the capital of Yongzhou before

403
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
from the day I entered the palace.

404
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,319
If I leave this time,

405
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,640
I won't know when I can return.

406
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,880
His Highness has arranged everything.

407
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
He said

408
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,239
you were Queen Yige's maidservant.

409
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,959
Naturally, he wouldn't let you suffer.

410
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,760
So he asked Fountain Abode

411
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,680
to buy a house in your hometown.

412
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,160
He also prepared a shop
for you to make a living.

413
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,479
His Highness said

414
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,319
you were the one in charge

415
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,680
of the money in the residence.

416
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,439
You'll be able to manage this shop too.

417
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,319
You might never know

418
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,239
if His Highness will borrow money
from you.

419
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,680
I'll take it

420
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,560
as managing the shop
for His Highness, then.

421
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,239
He also said

422
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:50,079
you should live without restraint.

423
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,560
Don't ever meddle
in other things anymore.

424
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,400
Otherwise,

425
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,839
he'll feel guilty toward you

426
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,520
and the late Queen Yige.

427
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,000
I understand.

428
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,520
May you have a safe journey.

429
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,439
Be safe always.

430
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,079
This way, please.

431
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,481
Your Highness.

432
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:04,241
Is everything ready?

433
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,201
Yes.

434
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,399
I told Miss Fengxi you had to leave

435
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,559
for an urgent matter.

436
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:09,519
Good.

437
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,000
Your Highness.

438
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,240
We were promised 500 elite soldiers.

439
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
They don't look elite at all.

440
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,879
These are riff-raff.

441
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,639
The crisis at Liangcheng is serious.

442
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,919
Who could have interfered

443
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,759
to set you up?

444
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,519
No one would dare to do it

445
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,519
without my father's permission.

446
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:32,080
His Lordship?

447
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,159
Why would he do this?

448
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,200
For two reasons.

449
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,159
He doesn't want to prevent war.

450
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:39,480
He wants to start one.

451
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,600
If Liangcheng is lost,

452
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,159
it will be a great opportunity
to attack Qingzhou.

453
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:44,759
He'll have a reason to attack.

454
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,000
Secondly, my father is paranoid.

455
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
If he sent me the elite soldiers,

456
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,519
I might rebel against him.

457
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,480
Therefore,

458
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:54,879
he must weaken my military strength.

459
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:57,240
If you knew,

460
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,519
why would you agree to go?

461
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,080
Effort determines the outcome.

462
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,759
Black Foxy!

463
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,120
Miss Fengxi.

464
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,519
What brings you here?

465
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,200
I just sent Zhong Li to inform you.

466
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,519
You're fast.

467
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,759
If you could leave without a goodbye,

468
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,200
I could certainly sneak behind you.

469
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:18,720
You're here for me.

470
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,639
No.

471
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,360
I am going to Liangcheng.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,960
Do you have work there?

473
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,759
It's a secret.

474
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,519
By the way,

475
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
are these your soldiers?

476
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,320
I sneaked in like an intruder,

477
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:36,600
but none was there to stop me.

478
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,000
They aren't my soldiers,

479
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,519
but they will be.

480
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,360
Liangcheng is at the border
of Yongzhou and Qingzhou,

481
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
near the Nu River.

482
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,720
There aren't many farmlands,

483
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,759
but the plain is wide.

484
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:49,519
It's great as a training ground.

485
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:50,639
These soldiers

486
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:51,600
seem tardy,

487
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,960
but I can sense their strong will.

488
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,919
These people survived the battlefield.

489
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:55,960
Impressive.

490
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:57,320
You have keen eyes.

491
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,519
You saw through my intention.

492
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:00,840
But still,

493
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,679
how do you know
so much about Liangcheng?

494
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,159
I was there years ago.

495
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,519
Let's be honest.

496
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:13,000
You know what I plan to do.

497
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
You said you didn't want to

498
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,200
get involved.

499
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
Who says I'm getting involved?

500
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,401
Your Highness.

501
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:28,800
Prince Yongping has left the capital.

502
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:29,680
Are you sure?

503
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:48,372
(Prince Yongping leads the Fountain Abode
and the House of Jade.)

504
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,449
(Hei Fengxi is
Feng Lanxi's secret identity.)

505
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:53,641
(Hei Fengxi is
Feng Lanxi's secret identity.)

506
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:57,720
Your Highness, what's wrong?

507
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:14,881
Your Highness.

508
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,241
This is a serious matter.

509
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:17,600
Should we inform the Queen?

510
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,761
Not now.

511
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:23,641
I need time to think.

512
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,480
Feng Lanxi is Hei Fengxi
of the Fountain Abode?

513
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,160
That's what Prince Ju's scout

514
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,119
tells us.

515
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,000
It's probably confirmed.

516
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,559
Feng Lanxi is beyond cunning and evil.

517
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,039
This is truly... terrifying.

518
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,279
Your Highness, if he is so powerful,

519
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,759
how should we deal with him?

520
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,279
That is good.

521
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,400
If I am worried,

522
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,440
so is His Lordship.

523
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,839
He wants to hide his trump card.

524
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,519
So, we must find a way

525
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,920
to expose it.

526
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:36,759
It's a downpour out here!

527
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,519
I'm totally drenched!

528
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,720
Fall back!

529
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,039
Forget about going to Liangcheng

530
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,039
in this heavy rain!

531
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,960
I quit!

532
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,400
I quit!

533
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,240
We quit!

534
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,960
I quit!

535
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,519
Take a break.

536
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,240
I quit!

537
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,440
I'm done!

538
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,039
I can't walk anymore!

539
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,839
I quit!

540
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,200
I quit!

541
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,359
We quit!

542
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,359
A bunch of instigators.

543
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,839
You are disobeying His Lordship's order!

544
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,279
What if we are?

545
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,119
I quit!

546
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah! We quit!

547
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,519
Stop!

548
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,839
Your Highness.

549
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,279
It's hard to march on muddy soil!

550
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,839
Lean on and support each other!

551
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,440
If you're tired,

552
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,279
lean on the rope and take a break!

553
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,880
Stand up.

554
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:26,440
Stand up.

555
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,039
Get up.

556
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,559
I'll lead the way!

557
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,559
Come, follow His Highness.

558
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Let's go!

559
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,680
Push harder!

560
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,519
Well? Have you found anything
in the capital of Yongzhou?

561
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,839
Feng Lanxi is Hei Fengxi
of the Fountain Abode.

562
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,880
They are one of the same.

563
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,799
I thought the princes of Yongzhou
were unworthy of my time,

564
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,000
unlike their father,
the Lord of Yongzhou.

565
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,799
Mr. Lanxi is a man
of poise and good deportment,

566
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
but he's never a threat.

567
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,519
But surprisingly,
Feng Lanxi is Hei Fengxi.

568
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,519
It seems the fight over this land

569
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,359
will be even more interesting.

570
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,359
Indeed.

571
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,559
But if the Lord of Yongzhou finds out,

572
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,079
Mr. Feng might not survive his fury.

573
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,519
Wuyuan, with your help,
the odds are in my favor.

574
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,319
I was told you had executed
Grand Tutor Ran.

575
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,480
Yes.

576
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,680
I thought Jizhou would be free
from internal struggles.

577
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,920
It seems there are
still some people with ill intent.

578
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,240
Eliminating Grand Tutor Ran
isn't enough.

579
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,000
Wuyuan, I need your help.

580
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,079
Why are you getting so impatient?

581
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,839
Princess Chunran of Youzhou
is looking for a spouse.

582
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,359
I will use this chance
for a marriage of state.

583
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,279
But, before I head for Youzhou,

584
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,440
I must take care of
the trouble within Jizhou.

585
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,000
A wise decision.

586
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,519
Your Highness.

587
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,960
There is a ravine beyond this valley

588
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,480
where we can take shelter.

589
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,240
We will make camp

590
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,960
after we go over

591
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:39,839
the mountain pass!

592
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,000
Hang in there, everyone!

593
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,400
If you slow us down,

594
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,680
there will be no liquor for you!

595
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,279
Your Highness.

596
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,920
Are you sure you have enough liquor?

597
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,960
You can't get drunk during a march.

598
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,799
When we arrive in Liangcheng,

599
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,119
drink and eat heartily!

600
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,799
Yes!

601
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,839
Press on!

602
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,480
No.

603
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,200
The cliff is collapsing!

604
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,240
Run!

605
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,279
Run!

606
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,240
Hurry up!

607
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,039
Pick up the pace!

608
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,279
Hurry!

609
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,119
Hurry!

610
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,160
Hurry!

611
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,480
Hurry up!

612
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,359
Hurry!

613
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
Move!

614
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,319
Pick up the pace!

615
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,839
Hurry!

616
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,680
Let's go!

617
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,640
Pick up the pace!

618
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,759
- Pick up the pace!
- Hurry!

619
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,000
Hurry!

620
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,960
Run!

621
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:43,839
Run!

622
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,359
Run!

623
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,599
Run!

624
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,960
- Run!
- Watch out!

625
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,319
Run!

626
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:56,599
Go.

627
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,680
(Youzhou)

628
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,361
Your Highness,

629
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:40,241
I got news from the Royal Study.

630
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
Apart from Yongzhou,

631
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:44,161
other States have all replied.

632
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:45,321
They said

633
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,200
they would send their princes
for the marriage proposal.

634
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,401
I see.

635
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
I also heard

636
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,521
that the heir of Lord of Jizhou,
Huang Chao, will come too.

637
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,840
I heard he

638
00:31:57,121 --> 00:31:58,840
is both educated and skilled.

639
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,840
He's touted
as the cornerstone of Jizhou.

640
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,881
Some even claim

641
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,200
that should Dadong fall,

642
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:05,200
Huang Chao is most likely
to be the new Emperor.

643
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:08,161
Your Highness,
if you can tie the knot with him,

644
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,640
you might become
the future empress consort.

645
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Huang Chao?

646
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:14,080
If he's coming,

647
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:15,881
that changes everything.

648
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:17,961
How so?

649
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:23,401
Huang Chao wants the world.

650
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
If he's coming,

651
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:27,200
it's not for me.

652
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,200
It's for Youzhou.

653
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,360
If I pick a slightly disfavored husband,

654
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,041
I might have a chance
to stay in Youzhou.

655
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:34,241
But if he's here,

656
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:36,440
even if Father wishes me to stay,

657
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,161
it will be difficult.

658
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,720
Why do you wish to stay in Youzhou,
Your Highness?

659
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,560
The first ruler of Qingzhou was a queen.

660
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,401
Why can't I do the same here?

661
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:50,121
I have to try.

662
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:53,521
In that case,
Huang Chao is not the best suitor.

663
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,640
I need a solution.

664
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:03,000
I heard that yesterday,

665
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:06,161
someone sent father
a sarira as a tribute.

666
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,200
Indeed.

667
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:10,000
His Lordship rewarded
the minister handsomely for it.

668
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,761
A sarira...

669
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,440
This is my chance.

670
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,681
Here. The bread is ready.

671
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,041
Come.

672
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:23,200
If His Highness

673
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,720
hadn't intervened,
we would have been dead by now.

674
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:26,800
-Right.
-Come on.

675
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:28,720
We owe our lives to him.

676
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,200
If he needs our help, just ask away.

677
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:32,401
Up the mountain or to the ocean,

678
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:33,681
we will not say no to it.

679
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,321
Definitely!

680
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,041
All of you were walking in the rain.

681
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,720
Please do not catch a cold.

682
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,280
His Highness has prepared this liquor

683
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:43,560
to warm you up.

684
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,840
- Thanks, Your Highness.
- Thanks, Your Highness.

685
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:46,881
Also, His Highness

686
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:49,200
said that all of you were his first army

687
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:51,241
to escort him to Liangcheng.

688
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:53,041
This special bond is invaluable.

689
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:54,520
His Highness

690
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,240
will forever cherish
everyone's contribution here.

691
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:57,960
A fine leader!

692
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,440
Give them liquor and meat.

693
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,321
Here.

694
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,041
Have some meat.

695
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,680
Come. Have some meat.

696
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,840
To be able to hear those chants,

697
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:13,560
your small injury is worth it.

698
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,801
I didn't give it much thought.

699
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,761
I just thought that morale
was the important thing on this trip.

700
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,400
Besides,

701
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,161
if I'm to amass an army in Liangcheng,

702
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:25,481
they will be the backbone.

703
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:27,560
Naturally,
I'll treat them with sincerity.

704
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,680
You look cunning

705
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,560
but you have a kind soul.

706
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:35,520
Shall I take it as a compliment?

707
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,440
Yes.

708
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,240
But don't get ahead of yourself.

709
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:43,361
All right.

710
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:45,921
You'll sleep here today.

711
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:47,240
I will sleep with them.

712
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,960
Sharing a night with your comrades
is a good gesture

713
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:54,041
but your reverence
will diminish as well.

714
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,440
When you command an army,
you still need to comport yourself.

715
00:34:58,761 --> 00:34:59,801
You know this too?

716
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,400
Aren't you injured?

717
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,400
If I ask you to leave,

718
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,680
I'll look like a pedantic person,
won't I?

719
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:06,801
Stay then.

720
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:08,680
I've been in this martial arts world
far too long for petty rules.

721
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:13,120
The bed is soft.

722
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,361
It sure feels cozy to sleep on it.

723
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:16,801
However, knowing your condition,

724
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:18,881
a soft bed will make you tired.

725
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:20,801
In that case...

726
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,321
I'll take the floor.
You'll take the bed.

727
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,520
Exactly.

728
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:54,280
(This military trip
is long and arduous.)

729
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
(But with you by my side,)

730
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,520
(it feels like the best days)

731
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,000
(in my life.)

732
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:16,310
(Yong)

733
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,520
Look!

734
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:26,520
So many ravens!

735
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,560
So many ravens!

736
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:28,400
So many ravens!

737
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:33,601
That is a bad sign.

738
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,041
Indeed.

739
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:35,161
An omen.

740
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,201
Bad luck.

741
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,400
Over there too.

742
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:38,720
What is that?

743
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,761
There are so many of them!

744
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,400
Will we ever reach the city?

745
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,201
So many!

746
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:42,761
Yes.

747
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,720
So many ravens.

748
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,400
This is a very bad sign.

749
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:48,240
Won't we even arrive
at Liangcheng safely?

750
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,361
Enough. Don't jinx it.

751
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,840
Chuanyun,

752
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,400
inform His Highness.

753
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,081
Okay.

754
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,520
We can't go like this.

755
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,881
Exactly.

756
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,520
Your Highness.

757
00:36:58,641 --> 00:36:59,240
Your Highness.

758
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,081
Why the ruckus?

759
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,921
A flock of ravens flew by.

760
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:03,761
The soldiers saw it

761
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,081
and thought it was a bad sign.

762
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,120
Ravens?

763
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,560
They prefer to dwell
in the mountain or the woods.

764
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,560
The winter just ended
so that means they are looking for food.

765
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,520
There are a lot of leftovers

766
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,840
from the bonfire we had last night.

767
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,520
That's why they came.

768
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,361
But this will dampen our morale.

769
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,520
After all,
the raven is a sign of bad luck.

770
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,081
Not necessarily.

771
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,440
What do you mean, Miss Fengxi?

772
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,761
What you did yesterday won their heart

773
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:32,280
but you have yet
to command their respect.

774
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,601
Now is your chance.

775
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,921
To command their respect?

776
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,120
Even in the past, before we do anything,

777
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:39,400
we seek a good sign first.

778
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,601
Revolutionaries like Chen Sheng
and Wu Guang hid notes in the fish.

779
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,601
Liu Bang slaughtered a white snake.

780
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,881
And now, you have a flock of ravens.

781
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,440
