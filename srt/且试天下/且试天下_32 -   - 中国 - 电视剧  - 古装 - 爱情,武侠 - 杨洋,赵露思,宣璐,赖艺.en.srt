20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,000
I didn't expect you'll be here

21
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:48,239
after my retirement.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,879
I happened to pass by.

23
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,400
So I came to visit you.

24
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:57,760
Well, you come at the right time.

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,239
I must be fated to meet you.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,199
Mr. Yu.

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,720
I got my hand on something
many days ago.

29
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,600
I wonder if you know its origin.

30
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,080
If I'm not mistaken,

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,440
my father passed it down to me
after I was born.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,559
However, I lost it later.

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Lost?

34
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,960
How can you

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,880
lose such an important thing?

36
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,080
It all began

37
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,759
ten years ago

38
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,679
when Qionglin Park caught fire.

39
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,600
Back then, a bandit
snuck into Qionglin Park

40
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,679
and toppled a candlestick.

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,839
The entire park was reduced to ashes.

42
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,160
I wasn't as powerful back then

43
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,240
so the bandit managed to flee.

44
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,199
That was when I lost this jade pendant.

45
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,679
However, may I know

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,839
how you got this jade pendant,
Master Bai?

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,440
I

48
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,119
chanced upon it.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,600
I met an old jade carver within
the Royal Palace of Yongzhou.

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,160
He claimed to have made this
jade pendant for Yu family.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,399
He recognized this straight away.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
This jade pendant

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,039
was somehow tied
to the death of my friend.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,679
Hence, I turned to you.

55
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,360
Are you aware of the Token Keepers?

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,039
Token Keepers?

57
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,440
My family record did mention them.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Are you...

59
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,479
I am one of them.

60
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,880
When the fake Empyrean Token
was circulated,

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,960
other keepers and I

62
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,880
were tracking down the perpetrator.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,160
During the process,
we found this jade pendant.

64
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,919
I'm sure the perpetrator

65
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,279
must have something to do
with the bandit

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,600
who snuck into Qionglin Park.

67
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,479
Don't worry, Master Bai.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,279
I will investigate this matter.

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,160
You will

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,399
be notified of any discovery.

71
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,079
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

72
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,519
As for this jade pendant...

73
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,000
You can keep it.

74
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,959
(We'll see how long you can keep it.)

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
(You know too much.)

76
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,640
(Unfortunately for you.)

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Master!

78
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,119
What is bothering you?

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,760
I can hear you sigh from the door.

80
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,399
Have a seat.

81
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,679
How have you been with Mr. Feng?

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,079
Couldn't be better.

83
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,880
Is this what you wanted to know?

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
I summoned you

85
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,920
because I need to tell you something.

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,679
After tomorrow,

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,880
I will be officially retired.

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,519
The world

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,000
belongs to the young ones like you.

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,600
While I can still walk,

91
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,679
I want to travel
and figure out something.

92
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,279
What thing?

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
Oh, I mean

94
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,760
I want to travel

95
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,600
and figure out
the whereabouts of my friends.

96
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,359
You

97
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,239
are the best candidate
to be the Leader of the Sect.

98
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,480
But knowing your identity

99
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,959
and your current situation,

100
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,279
I don't think
I can convince you to stay.

101
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,359
Who do you think

102
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,640
can take up my position?

103
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,480
I believe Langhua

104
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,239
will be a fine leader.

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,519
She

106
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,679
is still immature.

107
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,000
She can't possibly
manage a sect properly.

108
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,480
While she's indeed young

109
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,959
and a bit immature,

110
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,959
she did inherit your martial arts.

111
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,160
Besides,

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,399
she grew up in Tianshuang Sect.

113
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,839
She knows it the best.

114
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,959
She can definitely pass down
the ideology of Tianshuang Sect.

115
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,359
I'm just worried
that it will be too much for her.

116
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,040
No one was born to be a leader.

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,160
When you were off to Mount Wu,

118
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,600
I did a terrible job at leading either.

119
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,200
Besides,

120
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,160
Langhua is not alone.

121
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,880
Jiurong is with her.

122
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Jiurong possesses a mild disposition.

123
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,000
He is a diplomat.

124
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,200
Everyone in the sect trusts him.

125
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:43,959
He will make up
for Langhua's shortcomings.

126
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,079
Perhaps you can let Jiurong
be the Deputy Leader

127
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,079
to assist Langhua.

128
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,359
What do you think, Master?

129
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,679
Good idea.

130
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,679
What about you?

131
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,040
What's your plan?

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,959
The world is chaotic.

133
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,640
Do you want to return to Qingzhou?

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Qingzhou doesn't need me at the moment.

135
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,559
I will follow wherever he goes.

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,640
All right.

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,760
You are a smart girl

138
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,720
but you find politics distasteful.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,600
He can be in politics

140
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,000
while you support him from behind.

141
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
That's a pretty good team.

142
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,160
However, be mindful of his ambition.

143
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,440
When he claims the throne,

144
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,640
he might...

145
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,720
Master, that's too far into the future.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,640
I'll let my future self decide.

147
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,279
As long as he loves me,

148
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,119
he loves his subjects, and he wants
to bring peace to the world,

149
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,239
I will follow him.

150
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,200
You have made your decision then.

151
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,760
Still, I'll give you some advice.

152
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,320
Wherever you are,

153
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,239
be careful and vigilant.

154
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,279
This world is dangerous.

155
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,000
Do not let your guard down.

156
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,320
Remember this.

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
Yes, Master.

158
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,679
You call me Master

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,559
but I always regard you as my daughter.

160
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,119
I truly wish that you can find

161
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,679
happiness.

162
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,040
Go now.

163
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,959
Go to bed early too, Master.

164
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:45,840
(Tianshuang Sect)

165
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,120
(Pavilion among Clouds)
Do you know what time it is now?

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,280
(Pavilion among Clouds)
Where is Master Bai?

167
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,640
Patience, my friends.

168
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,320
Langhua went to bring him out.

169
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,679
Please wait for a moment.

170
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,280
Bai Fengxi!

171
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,000
Langhua!

172
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,440
My father is dead.

173
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,000
You killed him!

174
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,280
He gave you everything.

175
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,159
Why would you bring harm to him?

176
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,359
Master?

177
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,400
Master!

178
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,359
You are the last person
who talked to my father last night.

179
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,960
Who is the killer if not you?

180
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,239
How dare she?

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let me have a look at him.

182
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,960
Langhua!

183
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,840
My father's hands
were all shriveled when he died.

184
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,640
You must have poisoned him!

185
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,039
Miss Bai, something is off.

186
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,760
Are you sure
your father died from poison?

187
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,080
Is there any other explanation?

188
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,000
This is a complicated matter.

189
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
We cannot give you an explanation now.

190
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,640
I will get to the bottom of this

191
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,919
and find out the killer.

192
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,159
No explanation or no excuse?

193
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,159
Both of you haven't come up
with a statement, have you?

194
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,239
One poisons while the other
finds ways to escape.

195
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,119
You two are accomplices.

196
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,400
There must be
a misunderstanding, Langhua.

197
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,719
Martial Sister will not do this.

198
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,400
After you left,
my father never left his room.

199
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,320
While I can still walk,

200
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,200
I want to travel
and figure out something.

201
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,280
What thing?

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,479
Oh, I mean

203
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,760
I want to travel

204
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,599
and figure out
the whereabouts of my friends.

205
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,760
Wherever you are,

206
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,159
be careful and vigilant.

207
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,840
Do not let your guard down.

208
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,559
This world is dangerous.

209
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,960
Why are you all quiet now?

210
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,280
Langhua.

211
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,239
I know how you feel now.

212
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,000
Please let me have a look at Master.

213
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,719
And then, we'll talk.

214
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,400
You do not have the right
to see my father.

215
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,200
She's after the Leader position.

216
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,559
Even if she's not doing this
for herself,

217
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,960
she's doing it for someone close to her.

218
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,960
- Hei Fengxi has fallen from grace.
- Shut up!

219
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,039
I do not covet the Leader position

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,000
nor did I scheme for someone.

221
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:54,280
Miss Bai, I do not want anything
from Tianshuang Sect.

222
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:55,520
I am a man of my words.

223
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,840
I will investigate it thoroughly

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,119
and bring justice to his death.

225
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,960
Your martial sister
is being framed here.

226
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,000
Langhua.

227
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,000
How can I gain your trust?

228
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,039
If you're innocent and cooperative,

229
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,960
you should be locked up first.

230
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:11,039
Now, I wonder
if you're willing to do it.

231
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,960
You have lived far too long.

232
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,119
I...

233
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,559
Fengxi, let's go.

234
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,239
I want to have a look at him.

235
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:21,760
Wait!

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,679
Master Bai just died.

237
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,000
No one knows what happened yet

238
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,640
and now, you want to flee?

239
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,320
Exactly.

240
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,359
Let's take her down together!

241
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,000
How dare you!

242
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:30,880
Don't let her flee.

243
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
Right! If she flees,
we'll never catch the killer!

244
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,039
If you leave now,
it means you're guilty.

245
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,599
Let's go!

246
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:36,599
Charge!

247
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,239
Don't let her run!

248
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:47,919
Martial Sister!

249
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,239
I...

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,359
Do not hurt them.

251
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,919
Your Highness, let's leave now.

252
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,320
Make way for Fountain Abode!

253
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,249
(Youzhou)

254
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:07,479
Cunning, aren't you?

255
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,799
You never intended

256
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,000
to marry me.

257
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,799
I know

258
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,760
you want to rule the world.

259
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,799
Unfortunately,

260
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,119
while Bai Fengxi is powerful,

261
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,520
the future ruler

262
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,919
has to be my husband.

263
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,599
Your Highness,

264
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,599
the Ministry of Rite has sent
the gown and ritual apparatus

265
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,919
for the wedding ceremony tomorrow.

266
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,159
Please have a look at them.

267
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,840
Noted.

268
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,320
Those who abandon me
will not be kept around.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,719
Burn it.

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,559
Yes, Your Highness.

271
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:50,877
(Qingfeng Temple)

272
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,799
I'm fine.

273
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,479
You will be.

274
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,239
I have someone looking
for a physician now.

275
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,200
Talk to me.

276
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,000
If

277
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
I die...

278
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,000
Do not say that.

279
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,200
I mean, if...

280
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,960
No if.

281
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,520
As domineering as ever.

282
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,200
If the Grim Reaper

283
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,760
insists on taking you away,

284
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,239
then I'll go to Hell

285
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,840
and turn that place upside down.

286
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,640
I will bring you back

287
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,239
no matter what.

288
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,719
We have been through a lot.

289
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,200
There are good memories
and bad memories.

290
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,039
Regardless of how our story ends,

291
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,640
I have no regrets.

292
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,080
But you...

293
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,840
You have to lead a good life.

294
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,559
After I met you,

295
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,359
my life has a purpose.

296
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,960
I don't know what my life will be
without you.

297
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,359
Do you hear me?

298
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,239
Answer me.

299
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,359
Say something!

300
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
Flower of Sacred Enlightenment.

301
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,640
(This flower is also called
Sacred Jade Moon.)

302
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,039
I cultivated it myself.

303
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,359
It only blooms once
every several decades.

304
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,159
Maybe one day
when your life is at stake,

305
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,799
it can bring you newfound vigor.

306
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,880
Right.

307
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,760
Old Taiyin said

308
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,960
that this flower contains
potent vitality.

309
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,039
It can save you.

310
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,359
It must.

00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,479
Flower of Sacred Enlightenment.

339
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,439
Your injury was too serious

340
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,239
so I used the Sacred Enlightenment Flower
Old Taiyin gave you.

341
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,319
I wanted to use it to heal you

342
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,880
but to my surprise,

343
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,680
it also repaired
my vital energy channels.

344
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,000
My inner force is back.

345
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,760
How is Tianshuang Sect now?

346
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,119
Don't worry.

347
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Zhong Li and others
have been protecting them.

348
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,079
The sect is safe

349
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:38,000
and Bai Langhua has become the Leader.

350
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,680
Master Bai

351
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,800
was buried two days ago.

352
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,520
No one knows how he died.

353
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,520
We need to identify the killer soon.

354
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,079
You said

355
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,000
this was a complicated matter.

356
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,280
Do you have any idea?

357
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,119
Master Bai died the same way

358
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,680
my mother did.

359
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,880
But didn't you say

360
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,000
that Queen Yige died from sickness?

361
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,760
So I thought

362
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,359
until I saw how Master Bai died.

363
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,319
After they died,

364
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,040
the skin on their hands

365
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,479
shriveled and puckered.

366
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Shriveled skin?

367
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,920
It's all speculation now

368
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,599
but we can assume

369
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,479
that Master Bai
contacted the same poison

370
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,599
as my mother did.

371
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,719
So

372
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:35,439
someone is trying to frame me?

373
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,079
Killing Master Bai

374
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,800
will create unrest within the sect too.

375
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,160
Two birds, one stone.

376
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,560
The perpetrator

377
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,560
set everything up deliberately.

378
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,079
I believe

379
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,160
Master Bai's death has something
to do with the fake Empyrean Token.

380
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,680
But I never heard him

381
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,959
talk about the fake token.

382
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,680
Martial Sister!

383
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,520
Pu.

384
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,439
Han Pu?

385
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,319
Martial Sister!

386
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:03,959
Pu.

387
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,280
How did you find this place?

388
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,680
I was worried about you

389
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,079
so I snuck out.

390
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,119
I kept looking for you and came here.

391
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,000
I thought it was just a hunch

392
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,640
but here you are!

393
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,040
How are you?

394
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
How is everyone?

395
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,719
Not too well.

396
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:25,160
Langhua looks fine

397
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,119
but I saw her cry
in secret so many times.

398
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,160
I know how it feels like
to lose a dear one.

399
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,359
Oh, Martial Sister.

400
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,520
I came to tell you

401
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,479
that after you left,

402
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,920
I tested Master's body
with a silver needle in secret.

403
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,599
I found no trace of poison

404
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,079
in his body.

405
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,719
No trace of poison?

406
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:47,920
Han Pu.

407
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
The Han family
is a family of physicians.

408
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:51,880
Do you know

409
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,560
of a poison that cannot be detected
by a silver needle?

410
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,719
Father once told me

411
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,239
that there exists

412
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,160
a poison called Nux Vomica.

413
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,719
It cannot be detected
by a silver needle.

414
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,000
Nux Vomica?

415
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,479
Why haven't I heard about it?

416
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Father said

417
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,239
that it was a poison concocted

418
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,479
by the Imperial Family of Dadong.

419
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,680
Not many are aware of it.

420
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,920
One of my ancestors
was an Imperial Physician.

421
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,959
He learned of its existence

422
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,560
by chance.

423
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,760
Nux Vomica.

424
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,560
A poison like this exists.

425
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,199
So the Imperial Family

426
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,439
is involved then.

427
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,599
Let's head to the Imperial City.

428
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

429
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,560
I'll ask Zhong Li to get ready.

430
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,959
Accompany me to one place, will you?

431
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:50,098
(Tomb of Bai Jiande, 
Beloved Leader of Tianshuang Sect)

432
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:08,066
(Tomb of Bai Jiande, 
Beloved Leader of Tianshuang Sect)

433
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:13,040
Master,

434
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,800
I have come to see you.

435
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,479
I remember
after I had the first taste of wine,

436
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,479
I would drink in secret

437
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,640
but you would always catch me.

438
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,280
You would then force me
to train as my punishment.

439
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,599
You're a girl.

440
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,920
You shouldn't drink.

441
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,640
Master! The martial arts world
is a place for quick revenge.

442
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,880
Two liang of beef
with a small pot of wine.

443
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,239
That's what you call a carefree life.

444
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,560
You only know the basics

445
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,760
and you think you can lead
a carefree life in the martial arts world?

446
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,719
I'll teach you a lesson.

447
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,760
- Master!
- Stay right there!

448
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,599
Master! Don't hit me!

449
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,599
After I defeated you,

450
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,199
I can tell

451
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,280
you were truly proud of me.

452
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,251
(Tomb of Bai Jiande, 
Beloved Leader of Tianshuang Sect)

453
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
I left home early.

454
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,760
Most of my memories
are from the Tianshuang Sect.

455
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,959
When I recall those memories,

456
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,520
it fills me with joy.

457
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,959
It's getting late.

458
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,520
We should leave now.

459
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,307
(Tomb of Bai Jiande, 
Beloved Leader of Tianshuang Sect)

460
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,119
I have news from Imperial City.

461
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,920
Nux Vomica is related

462
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,640
to the black market
of the Imperial City.

463
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,520
Black market?

464
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,680
Within the black market,

465
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,199
there's someone
called Supreme Physician.

466
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,880
He has something to do with Nux Vomica.

467
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
He's a careful person

468
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,359
and he never deals with strangers,

469
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,040
except when the client is introduced

470
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,719
by his regulars.

471
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,439
I see.

472
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,119
I'll handle it.

473
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,119
All right.

474
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,160
Martial Sister, bring me with you.

475
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,599
This trip to the Imperial City
is perilous.

476
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,839
You can't come with us.

477
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,560
But I want to help you.

478
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,959
Stay in Tianshuang Sect

479
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,760
and take care of others.

480
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,520
You'll do me a huge service there.

481
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,640
All right?

482
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:15,920
Okay.

483
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:19,238
(Qingzhou)

484
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:22,920
Your Highness,

485
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,239
I have news from the secret agent.

486
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
Anything about Xiyun?

487
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,319
Her whereabouts

488
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,760
remain a mystery.

489
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
I heard she was heavily injured.

490
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,880
Yes.

491
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,839
It is said

492
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,640
that Hei Fengxi of Fountain Abode
took Her Highness away.

493
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,800
If Feng Lanxi is with her,

494
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,719
that's great news.

495
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,959
Continue looking for her.

496
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,119
Yes, Your Highness.

497
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,239
Only

498
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,280
you and I know this.

499
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,000
Do not let my father know.

500
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,560
Noted.

501
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,359
Greetings, Your Highness.

502
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:16,920
At ease.

503
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,800
How is Father?

504
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,040
I just administered acupuncture
on His Lordship.

505
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,680
He has always been plagued
by a heart problem.

506
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,560
In recent years,
he has overworked himself

507
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,920
for Qingzhou.

508
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,599
I'm afraid his sickness
has gone out of hand

509
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:35,560
and I can only buy some time for him.

510
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,280
The situation is grave.

511
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,760
How long does he have?

512
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,400
Six months if we're lucky.

513
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,680
If not...

514
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,119
Just be honest.

515
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,719
Slightly more than a month.

516
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,280
You can go back to your work.

517
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

518
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,599
Greetings, Father.

519
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,680
May you live for a millennium.

520
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:18,119
My son.

521
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,680
Come here.

522
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,000
Have a seat.

523
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,719
I met Physician Liu outside.

524
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,640
He said your health had improved a lot.

525
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,839
My child,

526
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,560
I appreciate

527
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,000
your thoughtfulness.

528
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,319
But I know my health.

529
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,359
I don't have much time.

530
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:49,920
Father!

531
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:52,359
You love your subjects.
You are a wise ruler.

532
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,359
God will spare you.

533
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,920
While I can still talk,

534
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,280
I need to tell you something.

535
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,839
As my heir,

536
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,160
you have to answer to Qingzhou,

537
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,959
and to the world.

538
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,400
Be kind

539
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,079
to your subjects.

540
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,000
You need to know

541
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,560
the people are a nation's priority.

542
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,280
As for dominion...

543
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,439
Although Qingzhou never wishes
to rule the world,

544
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,199
seeing the situation we are in now,

545
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,520
you need to be prepared.

546
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,119
Elect a wise ruler and stand our ground.

547
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,760
Such is the preaching
of Qingzhou's ancestors.

548
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:44,199
I will remember it by heart.

549
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,079
I know you

550
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,439
very well.

551
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,599
I'm not worried

552
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,640
that you'll be led astray.

553
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,280
However, I just want you

554
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,239
to remember these principles.

555
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:03,800
Also,

556
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,079
Youzhou and Qingzhou
are neighboring states.

557
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:11,280
Both states do not get along very well.

558
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,119
I heard

559
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,359
that the Princess of Youzhou
has married the heir of Lord of Jizhou.

560
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,239
Knowing the Lord of Youzhou,

561
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,520
he will find an excuse

562
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,000
to invade Qingzhou.

563
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,239
Promise me

564
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:30,599
that you will not lose a city,

565
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:33,239
and you will not let war

566
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,719
ravage the livelihood of our people.

567
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,000
If Youzhou invades,

568
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,839
I will chase them away.

569
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,760
Good.

570
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,839
Good.

571
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,280
Go now, my child.

572
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,319
Tell Xiyun everything.

573
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,280
Do not keep her in the dark any longer.

574
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,800
Before I die,

575
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,359
I want to see her one last time.

576
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,520
Noted.

577
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,079
I will look for her now.

578
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,079
See you, Father.

579
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,439
Please get some rest.

580
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,680
Go.

581
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:18,959
Yes, Father.

582
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,319
- Cheers, Father.
- Cheers, Father-in-law.

583
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,319
Cheers.

584
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,760
Huang Chao.

585
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,680
Have you gotten accustomed to Youzhou?

586
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,040
Chunran is with me.

587
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,760
Of course, I have.

588
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:03,359
Now that Youzhou and Jizhou
are united by marriage,

589
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,599
what is your plan, Huang Chao?

590
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,400
I just got married

591
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,719
so I wish to stay
in Youzhou for a while.

592
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,560
Okay.

593
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,040
What is your opinion

594
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,280
on the relationship between both states?

595
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,319
We are united by marriage.

596
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,599
That means we are a family.

597
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,439
Definitely.

598
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,040
But a hierarchy exists
within a family too.

599
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,400
Father,

600
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,920
you're not concerned
about your daughter now?

601
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,520
Just politics?

602
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,599
Are you jealous, Chunran?

603
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,599
Oh, you're a kid.

604
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,959
I merely got married

605
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,319
and now, you give all the attention
to my husband.

606
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,000
How can I not be jealous?

607
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,560
I'll drink as an apology.

608
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,959
Do you hear that, Huang Chao?

609
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,079
My daughter is possessive.

610
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:00,959
She might be the end of you.

611
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
In that case,

612
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,160
I couldn't be happier.

613
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,599
That means I'm important to her,

614
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,520
doesn't that?

615
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,479
Good. Good.

616
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,000
Father-in-law.

617
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,599
Cheers.

618
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,920
Your Lordship.

619
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,479
Speak.

620
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,959
Huang Chao is my family.

621
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,079
Just speak.

622
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,680
Yes, Your Lordship.

623
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,079
I just received some news.

624
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:35,119
The heir of Lord of Qingzhou has been
managing the state affairs for two months.

625
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,239
Is this news trustworthy?

626
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:37,839
Yes.

627
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,839
You're dismissed.

628
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,760
Yes, Your Lordship.

629
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,199
Wonderful news!

630
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,160
God is in my favor!

631
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:49,839
Father, isn't it normal for an Heir
to manage the state affairs?

632
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:53,319
Feng Xingtao
has been the rival of my life.

633
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,520
I know him the most.

634
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,719
He always handles everything himself.

635
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,880
If he lets Xieyue handle
the state affairs for two months,

636
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,800
it means his health is failing.

637
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:05,040
If you want to conquer Qingzhou

638
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,359
via Youzhou's hands,

639
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,719
you need to wait.

640
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,199
For what?

641
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
For an opening.

642
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,159
It won't be for long.

643
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:14,719
(Is this the opening Wuyuan spoke of?)

644
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,439
Now is the best time for Youzhou
to launch the offensive.

645
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
I will not squander it away.

646
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,639
This is our comeback
for losing those cities back then.

647
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,159
After Feng Xingtao passes away,

648
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,000
Qingzhou will crumble down.

649
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,040
I will lead the army

650
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,760
and claim Qingzhou.

651
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,080
That will be your wedding gift,
my dear daughter.

652
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,520
Huang Chao, would you like
to follow me to conquer Qingzhou?

653
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,679
I would do anything
you ask me to, Father-in-law.

654
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,560
Besides, I have always wanted

655
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,399
to meet the Fengyun Cavalry of Qingzhou.

656
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,959
Good.

657
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,959
With your help,

658
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,919
everything will go smoothly.

659
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,560
I wish both of you a swift victory.

660
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,479
Come, let's have a toast.

661
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:04,439
Cheers.

662
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,000
Cheers.

663
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,639
What did you get?

664
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,996
(Dadong Black Market)

665
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,080
I do not sell this

666
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,639
to those below Black Mask.

667
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,679
This is a very conspicuous black market.

668
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,479
Many years ago,

669
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,280
the black market was well-hidden
like you assumed,

670
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,199
Miss Fengxi.

671
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:37,679
However, the court
just stops caring about it

672
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,520
so it came to the surface.

673
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,159
However, to preserve confidentiality,

674
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,520
everyone will put on a mask.

675
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,439
Let's check it out.

676
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,399
Miss Feng.

677
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,719
Long time no see, Mr. Tie.

678
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,879
Indeed.

679
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,719
We last met

680
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:57,600
(Mr. Tie, Head of Storm 38 Sect)
when you were fighting us,

681
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,280
the Storm 38 Sect.

682
00:35:58,479 --> 00:35:59,239
We suffered

683
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,800
a huge loss during that brawl.

684
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,919
- Mr. Tie...
- Oh...

685
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,239
You two are...

686
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,959
I'm Hei Fengxi from Fountain Abode.

687
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
This is my subordinate.

688
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,479
Nice to meet you, Head of Storm 38 Sect.

689
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,199
You're Hei Fengxi?

690
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,600
This is not...

691
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,040
I can confirm

692
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,520
that he is Hei Fengxi.

693
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,840
Who drew this?

694
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,600
She...

695
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,399
That's how I look like in your eyes?

696
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,000
Don't you find it dashing?

697
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,719
Impressive.

698
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,239
If you don't like it,

699
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,040
I'll just draw one

700
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,239
that pleases you.

701
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:09,800
I can tell

702
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,399
Miss Feng's heart is taken.

703
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,800
But if everyone from my sect knows this,

704
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:15,959
they will still fight for you

705
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,320
even if they are up against Mr. Feng.

706
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:18,560
Mr. Tie.

707
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,879
Let's talk business.

708
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,959
We want to enter the black market.

709
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,919
Do you know how?

710
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,239
If you want to enter the black market,

711
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,000
you follow its rules.

712
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,399
Look at this mask.

713
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,560
Some masks have black stripes.

714
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,120
It means you're a rookie.

715
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,080
Without another regular to help you out,

716
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,560
you cannot purchase many things.

717
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:41,719
For example, the Supreme Physician
you wish to meet

718
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,120
has a rule.

719
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,760
He only deals with people
above Silver Mask.

720
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,000
What about Gold Mask then?

721
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,760
Means you're a veteran.

722
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,439
A very rich one at that.

723
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,120
Mr. Tie, your business has flourished
these two years, hasn't it?

724
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,080
Of course.

725
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,040
Storm 38 Sect sells its goods

726
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
via the black market.

727
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,719
Worry not, Miss Feng.

728
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,000
We are lawful thieves now.

729
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,679
We have turned over a new leaf.

730
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,320
We're not like before.

731
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,760
Good.

732
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,520
Find us three masks

733
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
and bring us in.
