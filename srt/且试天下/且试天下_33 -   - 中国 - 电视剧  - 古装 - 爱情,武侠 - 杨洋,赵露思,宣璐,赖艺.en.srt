00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:42,048
=Episode 33=

20
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,040
According to the report,

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,319
the marriage arrangement between
Youzhou and Jizhou has been set.

22
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,319
Now,

23
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,959
both states are gathering
their forces in secret.

24
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,599
Looks like they are going
to declare war on Qingzhou.

25
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,239
My beloved officials.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,199
What do you think

27
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,639
we should do?

28
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,279
I think

29
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:02,400
that even with the combined forces
of Jizhou and Youzhou,

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,360
Qingzhou is more than capable enough
to defend their state.

31
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,360
Moreover,

32
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,679
this union between Youzhou and Jizhou

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,960
is a double-edged sword.

34
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,199
Lord of Youzhou
will be wary of Huang Chao.

35
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:18,679
Huang Chao will try his best
to take over Youzhou as well.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,199
I think

37
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,600
Yongzhou can just

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,839
observe for now.

39
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,639
I think that it's not appropriate
to do that.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,839
Qingzhou is our neighboring state.

41
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,800
If Jizhou and Youzhou manage
to conquer Qingzhou,

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,279
Yongzhou will be stuck in the middle.

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,679
Then, it'll become hard
for us to survive.

44
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,600
I think

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,759
we should join hands with Qingzhou

46
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,800
to disrupt Jizhou and Youzhou's plan.

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
I heard that these days,

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
Qingzhou is being governed

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,559
by Prince Xieyue.

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
If that's the case,

51
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,759
it'll be even easier
for Jizhou and Youzhou

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,039
to defeat Qingzhou.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,080
Feng Xingtao is
the backbone of Qingzhou.

54
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,160
If he falls right now,

55
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,080
Qingzhou will be in grave danger.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,919
If that's the case,

57
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,720
the best way is to join hands

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,279
with Qingzhou right now

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,639
just like what Minister Qin
had proposed.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,720
We can't just let them take away

61
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,039
such a prosperous land.

62
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,160
Yesterday, we received
the memorandum from Feng Ju.

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,600
Their military advance

64
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:29,919
is going smoothly.

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,119
They've managed to eliminate
the bandits in the south.

66
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,279
Besides raising his rank,

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,039
we have to reward his army.

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,520
Thank you, Your Lordship.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,919
After we reward his army,

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,639
replenish their food supply at once.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,199
They have to be ready
to set out at any time.

72
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,520
I will ask the Ministry of Rite
and Ministry of Works

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,479
to handle it at once.

74
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,399
I'll ask the Ministry of Revenue
to prepare more food supplies as well.

75
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,279
Rewarding the army is a serious matter.

76
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:57,000
I will go to the Ministry of War
at once to get it done.

77
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,520
My beloved officials.

78
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,279
I'm very glad that both of you

79
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,679
can understand me so well.

80
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,160
The power on this land is volatile.

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,479
It all depends on
the pre-emptive opportunities.

82
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,039
After rewarding the army,

83
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,880
ask them to set out to Qingzhou
at once and encamp there.

84
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
We'll play it by ear.

85
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,440
Yes, Your Lordship.

86
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,679
The moon will always be bright.

87
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,119
The mountains will always be standing.

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Why are you here?

89
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
An elder in my friend's home
is gravely ill.

90
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,359
I'm here to ask
for the 1000-year-old Red Reishi.

91
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,200
Hold on. I'll pass on the request.

92
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,880
He's quite good at martial arts.

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
He's a tip-top fighter
in the Imperial City.

94
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,440
He has killed before.

95
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,079
He has a fierce aura to him.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,559
I think he has been to war.

97
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,239
He practices external martial arts.

98
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,799
I'm afraid that the only ones
who have these qualities

99
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,119
in the Imperial City...

100
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,200
The Imperial Guards.

101
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,600
Looks like

102
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,880
we found the right person this time.

103
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,839
It'll be 3000 taels.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,440
We'll meet again.

105
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,359
This Supreme Physician
is very mysterious.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,760
All the transactions
are done through his guard.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,079
He rarely meets anyone.

108
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,239
He doesn't want to expose his identity.

109
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,559
But he can't hide

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,480
the smell of Lingxiang Herb on this box.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
It's a fragrance

112
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
that is specially used
by the people in the palace

113
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,679
to hide their own smell.

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,519
I think this high-quality Red Reishi
is a tribute.

115
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,119
Normal people can't
get their hands on it at all.

116
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:53,920
Maybe he's a eunuch who is in charge
of the Imperial Apothecary.

117
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,359
Who are you?

118
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,359
(Supervisor of the Imperial Apothecary, Eunuch Hu)
Do you know who I am?

119
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,679
Since we are here for you,

120
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,200
of course we know.

121
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,640
You don't have to be afraid.

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,760
It's just

123
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,359
that my young master wants to meet you.

124
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,519
I don't care who he is.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,679
I will never meet him.

126
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,399
Go away.

127
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:35,959
What are you doing?

128
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,440
Are you going to kidnap me?

129
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,040
We are here to invite you.

130
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,279
If you refuse to cooperate,

131
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,480
please forgive us for being rude.

132
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Do you really think
that I'm all by myself?

133
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,119
Guards.

134
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,600
If you are talking about those guards

135
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
in the courtyard,

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,799
they are all unconscious now.

137
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,959
Please come with us, Eunuch Hu.

138
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Let me tell you.

139
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
Since you are so accommodating,

140
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,640
we have to be more polite too.

141
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:17,880
Take him away.

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,239
Roger that.

143
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,119
Who are you?

144
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,079
Why did you kidnap me?

145
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,720
Should I call you Eunuch Hu

146
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,359
or should I call you
the Supreme Physician?

147
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,279
Supreme Physician?

148
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,600
What Supreme Physician?

149
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,920
I don't understand.

150
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,640
You don't understand?
If that's the case,

151
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,359
I'll have to kill you.

152
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,959
Yes. I am the Supreme Physician.

153
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,480
Who are you?

154
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,239
When we bought the Red Reishi yesterday,

155
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,480
you sent someone to tail us, right?

156
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,920
Since you already knew,

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,760
why did you let them follow you?

158
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,640
If they hadn't followed us,

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,679
how would we know where you were?

160
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,000
You are right.

161
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:06,880
No.

162
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,720
What do you want?

163
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
I have money.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,559
I can give it all to you.

165
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,440
We are not doing this for the money.

166
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,640
We invited you here today

167
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,119
to check on something.

168
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,399
Do you know anything

169
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,119
about the Nux Vomica?

170
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,600
You are here for the Nux Vomica?

171
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,200
I sell it.

172
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,399
No.

173
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,760
I'll give it to you for free.

174
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,119
You are cautious.

175
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,679
We just want to know

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,679
whether or not someone
has bought it recently.

177
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,119
No.

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
Aren't you going to think about it?

179
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,559
It's true.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Nux Vomica is rare

181
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,679
even in the palace.

182
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,239
So, it's extremely expensive.

183
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,440
And not many know about it.

184
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:54,239
All these years,
I've only sold two of them.

185
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,479
Who did you sell it to?

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
As per the rules of the black market,

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
I don't ask about their identities.

188
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,359
You really don't know?

189
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,320
Yes.

190
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,559
But,

191
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,760
as a safety measure,

192
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,359
I'll send my men to tail those buyers

193
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,479
to draw a portrait of them.

194
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,119
Where are the portraits?

195
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:21,440
They are for my own safety.

196
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,000
Or course I'll keep them
in the safest place.

197
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,200
The safest place in Dadong Empire

198
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,239
is of course the Imperial Palace.

199
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,880
Then, we'll have to trouble you

200
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,320
to bring us there.

201
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,039
Sir.

202
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,200
Are you okay, Sir?

203
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,840
The Sacred Jade Moon

204
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,280
can only suppress
part of the blood curse.

205
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,599
If I want to break the curse,

206
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
our top priority

207
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,159
is to get the Empyrean Token.

208
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,479
We don't have much time.

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
We have to take action
as soon as possible.

210
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,200
Yes, Sir.

211
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,359
This way, please.

212
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,239
This is my record over the years.

213
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,548
(Red Reishi)

214
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,470
(Meat Reishi)

215
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,738
(Meat Reishi, Red Arsenic)

216
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:08,893
(Nux Vomica, Meat Reishi)

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,599
What's wrong?

218
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,119
This Longevity Amulet

219
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,359
(Nux Vomica, Meat Reishi)
is from the royal harem of Yongzhou.

220
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,280
If he's not lying,

221
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,599
then it's true that no one has bought
the Nux Vomica recently.

222
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,239
Eunuch Hu, there is a medical record

223
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,359
for the palace too, right?

224
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,039
Yes, there is.

225
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
Let me get it for you.

226
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,389
(Medical Record
of Dadong Imperial Apothecary)

227
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,400
Well.

228
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,479
My underlings are in charge of this.

229
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,559
I don't do these menial tasks now.

230
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,080
(Medical Record
of Dadong Imperial Apothecary)

231
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:56,921
(Yikun Palace, Head of Servant,
Jingren Palace, 12th of February)

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,249
(Servant Zhang Jin took the Nux Vomica.)

233
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,919
Zhang Jin?

234
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,559
Where is he from?

235
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,520
Yuqian Palace.

236
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,840
Is he the personal servant
of the Emperor of Dadong?

237
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,559
Eunuch Hu, I need the Nux Vomica.

238
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,119
Well...

239
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:24,919
But don't worry.

240
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,559
I'll pay you according
to the rules of the black market.

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,719
If you don't sell it to me

242
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
or if you give me the fake one,

243
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,520
your secret will be exposed.

244
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,200
I'll get it for you now.

245
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,400
Keep it well.

246
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:52,268
(Nux Vomica)

247
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,760
Thank you.

248
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,520
Let's go.

249
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,679
Guards! Assassin!

250
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,200
It's really not me.

251
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,479
I'm with you all the time.

252
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,359
I don't have time to sound the alarm.

253
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,280
- Father.
- Your Majesty.

254
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,800
(Imperial Palace of Dadong)

255
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Summon the imperial physician at once!

256
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,479
Summon the imperial physician at once!

257
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,000
Father.

258
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,000
Father!

259
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:22,919
Guards!

260
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,119
Summon the imperial physician now!

261
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,119
Summon the imperial physician now!

262
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,599
Father.

263
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,479
Father!

264
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Are you Mr. Yu?

265
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,479
My master asked me

266
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,960
(Eunuch of Dadong, Zhang Jin)
to wait for you here at this time.

267
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,159
It's me.

268
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,320
Luckily, I didn't disgrace myself,
and I completed my mission

269
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
after hiding here for so long.

270
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,919
Are you sure he is dead?

271
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,280
I'm sure.

272
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,400
Don't worry.

273
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,359
I'll get you out from here.

274
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

275
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,719
General Dong Shufang.

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,080
Why are you here so late at night?

277
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,200
His Majesty has been assassinated.

278
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,670
I've been ordered

279
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:12,840
(General of Dadong, Dong Shufang)
to search for the assassin.

280
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
His Majesty has been assassinated?

281
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,520
This...

282
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,039
His Majesty was assassinated just now?

283
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,599
This is too much of a coincidence.

284
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,640
Eunuch Hu.

285
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:23,919
Have you seen
any suspicious-looking men?

286
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,400
General, how is His Majesty now?

287
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,359
I'm so anxious now.

288
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,039
The imperial physician
is treating His Majesty now.

289
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,000
Eunuch Hu, I was asking you.

290
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,760
Have you seen
any suspicious-looking men?

291
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
No.

292
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,520
Do you know what I'm thinking?

293
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,159
If I can be with you,

294
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,559
I don't mind

295
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,719
staying here longer.

296
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,239
No.

297
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,479
Search the place!

298
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,039
Yes, General!

299
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,080
I have a report!

300
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,320
The personal servant in Yuqian Palace,
Zhang Jin, has gone missing.

301
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Lock down the Imperial Palace at once.
We have to find him.

302
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,000
Crown Prince has ordered you
to head to the imperial hall.

303
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,159
Okay.

304
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,880
Follow me.

305
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,919
Let's go.

306
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,359
You can come out now.

307
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,359
If Crown Prince has summoned him,

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,119
it means that His Majesty
is already dead.

309
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,479
It looks like Zhang Jin

310
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,919
knows a lot of secrets.

311
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,239
It's too much of a coincidence
for him to go missing now.

312
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,799
The palace is in a lockdown now.

313
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,200
Let's find a way to get out first.

314
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,280
Sirs,

315
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,960
can you please do me a favor?

316
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,719
After we pass the watchtower,
we'll be able to leave.

317
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,280
It takes 30 breaths
for the Imperial Guards

318
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,719
to finish a rotation on the watchtower.

319
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:53,320
I have an idea.

320
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:58,840
Who is it?

321
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,239
Your Highness,

322
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,760
Mr. Yu is already waiting
in the side hall.

323
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
- Sorry for being late.
- Rise.

324
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,800
Wuyuan.

325
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,560
My father is in fatal danger now.

326
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,239
If something happens to him,

327
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,439
this country, this position...

328
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,800
You have to help me.

329
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,479
Mr. Yu, have you been
in the Imperial City in the past few days?

330
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,880
His Highness invites me

331
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,439
to visit him at the palace every month
to study together.

332
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,719
I just reached here yesterday.

333
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,959
Are you suspecting me, General?

334
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
His Majesty was assassinated today.

335
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,359
Everyone who entered the palace

336
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,280
will become a suspect.

337
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,280
What is it?

338
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,560
Can't I suspect you?

339
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,520
General Dong Shufang.

340
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,560
Wuyuan is devoted to the Dadong Empire.

341
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,119
Although the Empyrean Yu family

342
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,560
has never joined the court
to become officials,

343
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,359
we are always there for the emperor.

344
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,439
We are loyal to the emperor.

345
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,920
But every state knows

346
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:06,359
that you are close
to Huang Chao of Jizhou.

347
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,560
Everyone knows

348
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,040
that Huang Chao has never given up

349
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,040
on his ambition to rule over the world.

350
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,359
And I've never hidden my relationship
with Jizhou from anyone.

351
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,800
But I have my own personal reasons
for not talking about it.

352
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,040
But don't worry,
Your Highness and General.

353
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,640
Everything that I do

354
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,000
will be for the people.

355
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
And I won't betray the people.

356
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,280
Okay, Mr. Yu.

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,239
Remember

358
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,959
what you said today.

359
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,199
His Majesty has passed away!

360
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,280
Father.

361
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,760
Your Majesty.

362
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,040
Your Majesty.

363
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,040
Father.

364
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,239
Your Majesty.

365
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,199
Father.

366
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,280
Your Majesty.

367
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:47,920
(The Empyrean Token)

368
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,199
Father!

369
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,560
(will be mine.)

370
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,040
The Imperial Guards are on high alert
to catch the assassin.

371
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,959
We are not allowed to pass through.

372
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,119
Let's find an inn to rest for the night.

373
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,400
All of you must be tired.

374
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,680
Okay.

375
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,880
Martial Sister Fengxi.

376
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,160
Martial Sister!

377
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,760
Why are you here?

378
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,040
You visited my father.

379
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,719
I saw the liquor you left

380
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,400
in front of his grave.

381
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,760
Martial Sister, are those
Imperial Guards chasing after you?

382
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,520
We can't stay here for long.

383
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
Let's talk at another place.

384
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,280
Your Highness.

385
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,439
You have to lock down
the Imperial City at once.

386
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,560
We can't let the people
know that His Majesty

387
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,479
has passed away.

388
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,439
No.

389
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,880
Why not?

390
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,439
I think

391
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
that we shouldn't keep this a secret.

392
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,439
We should tell the people about it.

393
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,560
Do you know

394
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,400
who the assassin is?

395
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Who is he working for?

396
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,800
How many spies are lurking in the city?

397
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,959
Do you think

398
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,040
that we can keep it a secret?

399
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,119
Yu Wuyuan.

400
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,560
What are you plotting?

401
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,400
All Six States are watching us
with ill intent.

402
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
With the passing of His Majesty,

403
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,239
all Six States will attack
the Imperial City.

404
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,040
That's why

405
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,400
we should spread the news.

406
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,640
A hero is born in troubled times.

407
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,199
Only when the Six States are at war

408
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,199
that His Highness will get
a slim chance of survival.

409
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,880
How can he survive?

410
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,640
Don't worry, General and Your Highness.

411
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,920
I have a solution.

412
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:25,880
Enough.

413
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,239
Pass down my order.

414
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,199
Inform the Six States

415
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,479
about my father's passing.

416
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,199
General Dong Shufang.

417
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,400
Yes, Your Highness.

418
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,400
Continue to search for the assassin.

419
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,040
Yes, Your Highness.

420
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,160
The silver needle is not reacting to it.

421
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,119
My father told me

422
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,800
that this poison is very rare.

423
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,880
It's used by the Imperial Army
of the Dadong Empire.

424
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,599
Not many know about it.

425
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,239
This kind of poison really exists.

426
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,520
Martial Sister, I've misunderstood you.

427
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,119
Get up.

428
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,959
I don't blame you.

429
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,560
Under that circumstance,

430
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,040
anyone would panic.

431
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
But I hurt you.

432
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
If something happened to you,

433
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,160
I would've done a grave mistake.

434
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,199
Martial Sister, I'm sorry.

435
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,599
There's no need to apologize.

436
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm still alive and doing well, right?

437
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,800
Let bygones be bygones.

438
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,160
Don't mention it again, okay?

439
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,640
It's already in the past.

440
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,439
Martial Sister won't
hold a grudge against you.

441
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,959
When did our master

442
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,359
offend someone from the Imperial Palace
of Dadong Empire?

443
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,319
Why did they poison him?

444
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,119
I think it's because our master

445
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,760
was investigating
the fake Empyrean Token in secret.

446
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Your Highness, we have received
a report from Fountain Abode.

447
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,959
They found a corpse
in front of the palace gate.

448
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,760
That corpse belongs

449
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,839
to the missing eunuch,

450
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,640
Zhang Jin.

451
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,479
Zhang Jin is dead?

452
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,079
What is his cause of death?

453
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,479
Who killed him?

454
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,760
Only one cut caused by the broadsword
is left on his body.

455
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,280
Based on the wound,

456
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,719
he was killed by a skill
used by the Soultaker Sect.

457
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,800
Was Zhang Jin a member
of the Soultaker Sect?

458
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,599
They silenced him with death.

459
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,239
If that's true,

460
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,880
then this is not as simple as we think.

461
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,800
They lured us here with the Nux Vomica.

462
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,280
And then, the Emperor of Dadong
was assassinated at the same time.

463
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,760
What is the mastermind planning?

464
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,119
Is the Soultaker Sect
responsible for my father's death?

465
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,160
I think Master Bai must
have discovered something.

466
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,839
That's why he was killed.

467
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:48,640
But now,

468
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,160
we are sure that the Soultaker Sect
is responsible

469
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,199
for the death of the Emperor of Dadong.

470
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,760
Martial Sister, let's seek the members
of the Soultaker Sect out.

471
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,560
Yes, we have to avenge our master.

472
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,680
No. Now that
the Emperor of Dadong is dead,

473
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,880
everyone will try to attack this place.

474
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,760
War is going to break out soon.

475
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,359
It'll be dangerous for you
to be out there.

476
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,079
Don't worry.

477
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,800
I'll find the real culprit.

478
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,599
I'll find the person
who killed our master

479
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,880
and avenge him.

480
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,280
- But...
- Langhua.

481
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,479
Master is gone.

482
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,239
You are his only daughter.

483
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,560
I'm sure he doesn't want

484
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,160
to see you putting yourself in danger.

485
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,359
Moreover,

486
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,920
you've been entrusted
with the duty to revive our sect.

487
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,640
You have to protect our juniors.

488
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:25,920
Understand?

489
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,119
Yes, Martial Sister.

490
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,800
Why are you here?

491
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,239
No one saw you, right?

492
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,079
I've already taken care

493
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,319
of the people outside.

494
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:51,959
They won't wake up so soon.

495
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,880
I sent you a letter
with a pigeon two days ago.

496
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,719
When the Lord of Yongzhou found out

497
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,479
that Jizhou and Youzhou
are joining hands,

498
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,079
he sent his troops to head towards
the border of Qingzhou.

499
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,800
He wants to reap the benefits from it.

500
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,680
What is the plan
of Mr. Yu and Prince Huang?

501
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:08,119
Mr. Yu is more ambitious than that.

502
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,439
Everything is going smoothly right now.

503
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,040
He is going to reopen

504
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,760
the old case of Yongzhou.

505
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:16,119
We train our subordinates
at length for one single use.

506
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,719
He wants you to make your move now.

507
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,119
I'll do as he commands.

508
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,719
Could it be

509
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
that he is confident

510
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,119
in taking down Yongzhou as well?

511
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,800
Yongzhou is nothing to speak of.

512
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,880
After all,
he has planned this for so long.

513
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,479
Let's talk about you for example.

514
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,839
Who would've thought

515
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,400
that the Prime Minister of Yongzhou

516
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,520
is the spy of Jizhou?

517
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,359
Mr. Yu has planned so ahead of time

518
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,839
just for this moment.

519
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,359
He is indeed wise.

520
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,560
That's it for now.

521
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,719
Feng Ju is
gathering his forces right now.

522
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,959
You can make use of him.

523
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,040
I'll follow up

524
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,359
with you later.

525
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,719
Wait.

526
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,839
How is my mother in Jizhou?

527
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,959
I can't stay by her side
to take care of her.

528
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,479
I miss her so much.

529
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,160
Don't worry.

530
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,959
Prince Huang Chao knows
that you are a citizen of Jizhou

531
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,040
who is working for Jizhou out here.

532
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,520
His Highness knows you are filial.

533
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,680
Of course she will be
well taken care of.

534
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,319
After we succeed
and everything is in place,

535
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,040
you can come back to Jizhou.

536
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,920
I promise you that you can be reunited
with your mother.

537
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,520
Thank you for His Highness' kindness.

538
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,880
(After the late queen passed away,
the royal harem let go of some people.)

539
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,640
(After the late queen passed away,
the royal harem let go of some people.)

540
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,880
Any news?

541
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,319
I've found her.

542
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,640
Not long after my mother passed away,

543
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,280
someone indeed left the royal harem.

544
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,000
Her appearance

545
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,520
is the same as in the portrait.

546
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,359
Besides,

547
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,160
she's still alive.

548
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,439
I have to go back to Yongzhou.

549
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,640
I'll go with you.

550
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,839
What do you want?

551
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,280
Nux Vomica.

552
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Queen Yige.

553
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
I don't know what you are talking about.

554
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,439
Looks like you don't want to see

555
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,760
your husband and son ever again.

556
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,319
Please don't hurt them.

557
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,599
In that incident,

558
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,439
you were just a pawn

559
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,479
who was being used.

560
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,640
You are still alive now.

561
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,359
I'm sure you don't want to die.

562
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,239
Besides,

563
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,160
you have a husband and son.

564
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,959
How painful it is

565
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,719
for your son to lose his mother.

566
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,160
I'll tell you everything.

567
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,359
Back then,

568
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,520
I was seduced
by Noble Consort Baili's money.

569
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,040
So, I obeyed her order

570
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,079
to buy medicine from the black market
in the Imperial City.

571
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,160
But back then,

572
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,359
I didn't know what the medicine was for.

573
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:00,256
(Nux Vomica)

574
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,040
After that, Queen Yige
suddenly passed away for no reason.

575
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,280
Only then did I realize

576
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,040
that the two incidents were connected.

577
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,280
Out of fear,

578
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,520
I asked for permission to leave.

579
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,680
That's all I know.

580
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,040
You know such a huge secret

581
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,920
about Baili.

582
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,400
Why did she let you leave the palace

583
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,599
instead of killing you?

584
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,680
Someone saved me in secret.

585
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,160
Who?

586
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,160
I don't know.

587
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,719
Tell me!

588
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,680
I really don't know.

589
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,599
Continue.

590
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,280
After that, everything was fine.

591
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I thought

592
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,959
that no one would know about it.

593
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,760
But I still can't run away from it.

594
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:39,839
But,

595
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,280
who are you?

596
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,280
Yige's son.

597
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,560
Your Highness, please spare my life.

598
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,719
I was wrong.

599
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,560
I have been repenting.

600
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,079
Please have mercy on me.

601
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,479
You are

602
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:58,959
still useful to me.

603
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:03,920
Prime Minister.

604
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,560
Feng Lanxi has found Du Xian.

605
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
The fish

606
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,280
has finally bitten the bait.

607
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,160
Notify Jizhou

608
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:19,319
that everything
is going according to plan.

609
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,239

Tell me.

634
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,959
I'm just thinking about the past.

635
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,760
I've always

636
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,839
lived in a conspiracy.

637
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,040
It's going to be exposed soon.

638
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,079
Now, I finally understand

639
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,719
why they fear me so much.

But I don't know

647
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,880
whether or not my father knows about it.

648
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,839
If he already knew about it,

649
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,680
what should I do?

650
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,160
No matter what happens after this,

651
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,479
let's face it together.

652
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:43,920
Don't worry.

653
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,000
I won't let them succeed.

654
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,599
Your Highness, as per your order,

655
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
I've put Du Xian and her family

656
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,599
under our protection.

657
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,479
Besides that,

658
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,160
I've sent out our men.

659
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,119
But,

660
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,520
the incident of the late queen

661
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,640
happened so long ago.

662
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,640
I'm afraid that we won't be able
to find much evidence on it.

663
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,520
We found the Nux Vomica this time.

664
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,880
I believe that with this progress

665
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,319
together with the evidence
that the Fountain Abode has found,

666
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,280
we can find out the truth.

667
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:09,959
Yes, Your Highness.

668
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:10,719
Another thing,

669
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:13,239
keep a close eye on Feng Ju's residence.

670
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,920
I think he'll come back
from the south soon.

671
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,079
Yes, Your Highness.

672
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:17,959
I'll handle it now.

673
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,239
What should we do next?

674
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,239
Expose their crime.

675
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,280
Let them deal with
the consequences of their actions.

676
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,239
And bring justice to my mother.

677
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,119
I just thought that my mother's death

678
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,119
was due to the rivalry
of the royal harem.

679
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,959
Now, it's not that simple.

680
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,560
I'm afraid
that the officials in the court

681
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,640
were involved in it as well.

682
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,880
Why would the officials of the court

683
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,239
work with Baili to murder Queen Yige?

684
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,439
Profits.

685
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,479
I think my mother
was too secure in her position.

686
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,280
So, she was in their way
of gaining profits.

687
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,280
Now,

688
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
we can only follow this lead

689
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,040
to uproot them.

690
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,839
Sorry for interrupting you
and Miss Feng, Your Highness.

691
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,000
Qiwu, how are you lately?

692
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm fine.

693
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:13,959
His Highness

694
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,119
had helped me before he left.

695
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,199
Moreover,

696
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,719
the Feng family has a strong influence 
in the capital of Yongzhou.

697
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,520
His Lordship won't attack us
without a care.

698
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,920
When we left the capital of Yongzhou,

699
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,520
you were the one
I worried about the most.

700
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:25,680
Qiwu.

701
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,520
Did something
happen in the capital lately?

702
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:29,959
This is the record of the past incidents

703
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,439
that had happened
in the capital recently.

704
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,479
Please take a look.

705
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,792
(Reward for the army)

706
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,640
Rewarding the army of the south.

707
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,119
Why are there so many soldiers?

708
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,239
You've realized it too, Your Highness.

709
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,239
I suspect

710
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:46,640
that His Lordship's target

711
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:47,959
is Qingzhou.

712
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,599
My father wants to attack Qingzhou?

713
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,760
I think he wants to prevent

714
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,920
Jizhou and Youzhou
from attacking Qingzhou together.

715
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,280
If Qingzhou is taken down,

716
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,599
Yongzhou will be in danger.

717
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,239
So, His Lordship sent out his troops

718
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,760
in the name of rewarding the army.

719
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,599
I think His Lordship wants
to gauge the situation first

720
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:04,719
before making a decision.

721
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,400
Now, most of our military forces

722
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,439
are heading towards
the border of Qingzhou.

723
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,839
The capital of Yongzhou
is at its weakest.

724
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,959
If anyone decides to attack us,

725
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,680
it'll be a dire situation for us.

726
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:15,800
Qiwu.

727
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:17,239
Report to me at once

728
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:17,880
if anything happens

729
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,079
in the court

730
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,640
these days.

731
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,319
Yes, Your Highness.

732
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,439
(How are you, Father, Brother?)

733
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,560
(I heard that it's dire for Qingzhou
under the attack of Jizhou and Youzhou.)

734
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:44,000
(I miss both of you so much.)

735
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,880
(I don't know the whole situation yet.)

736
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,839
(I can't wait to be back.)

737
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,209
(Qingzhou)

738
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,359
(Qingzhou)
Your Highness, according to our scout,

739
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,680
the army of Youzhou

740
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,760
will reach the border of Qingzhou soon.

741
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,880
Within half a month,

742
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,184
(General of Fengyun Cavalry, Xu Yuan)
they'll reach Langcheng.

743
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,079
What about their military forces?

744
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,760
Is the Skyrider Cavalry
of Jizhou with them?

745
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,199
Based on our intel,

746
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,120
Youzhou has sent out 50,000 soldiers.

747
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,159
But the Skyrider Cavalry of Jizhou
is not among them.

748
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,439
But Huang Chao is with them.

749
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,760
I think the Skyrider Cavalry
is on their way.

750
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,600
The Lord of Youzhou is determined

751
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,959
(Commander-in-chief of Fengyun Cavalry, Qi Shu)
to take down Qingzhou.

752
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,600
But,

753
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,800
he has forgotten who was the one

754
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,199
that abandoned his city
and surrendered 10 years ago.

755
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,280
Even if he has the Skyrider Cavalry,

756
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,360
we have the Fengyun Cavalry too.

757
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:30,439
We don't have to be afraid of him.

758
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,879
Your Highness,

759
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,520
aside from the soldiers of Youzhou,

760
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,239
the army of Yongzhou has reached
the south of Yongzhou a few days ago.

761
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,959
However, the Lord of Yongzhou
has sent us a letter

762
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,520
stating that Yongzhou
will lend us a hand

763
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,879
if we ask for their help.

764
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,000
Yongzhou?

765
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
They are just

766
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,719
another ambitious party with ill intent.

767
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,520
What's their target?

768
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,120
They want to take over our state too.

769
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,719
We can't work together

770
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,080
with those cunning snakes.

771
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,479
I agree.

772
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,159
Yongzhou is watching from the sideline

773
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,439
to reap the benefits of this war.

774
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,840
If we asked Yongzhou for help
to go against Youzhou,

775
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,320
it wouldn't be good

776
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
for Qingzhou.

777
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:10,639
General Xu,

778
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,479
bring 30,000 of our soldiers from
the Fengyun Cavalry to Langcheng first.

779
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,959
Defend Langcheng together
with the garrison there.

780
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,919
Yes, Your Highness.

781
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,040
General Qi.

782
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,879
Get a team to Lingcheng in secret.

783
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,719
If Huang Chao's Skyrider Cavalry
is to come,

784
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,399
they'll have to pass through Lingcheng.

785
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,199
Send a team to stop them.

786
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:31,000
Yes, Your Highness.

787
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I want to meet

788
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,879
this fearsome Skyrider Cavalry too.

789
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:40,040
I'll leave it to you then,
my fellow generals.

790
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,959
Yes, Your Highness.

791
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,600
Your Highness.

792
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,080
We have news from the Princess Xiyun.

793
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,840
Her Highness is in Yongzhou now.

794
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,239
Send her a letter at once.

795
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,439
Yes, Your Highness.

796
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:57,392
(Yongzhou)

797
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,080
Are you saying that Feng Lanxi
has found out about the Nux Vomica?

798
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,679
How is that possible?

799
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,280
It's true.

800
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,919
And Prince Lanxi already knows
that you are one behind it.

801
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,360
He's gathering evidence now.

802
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,919
Soon, he'll report it to His Lordship.

803
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,560
I am the mastermind?

804
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,040
Have you forgotten

805
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:28,600
who was the one who dragged me
into this back then?

806
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:32,560
But your dream came true

807
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,760
when you moved
into this Phoenix Palace, right?

808
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,639
But if His Lordship finds out

809
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,040
that you are the one who plotted
the murder of Yige back then,

810
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,000
what will he think of you?

811
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,800
Are you threatening me, Your Highness?

812
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:57,199
Since you are here
to inform me about it,

813
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:01,719
I'm sure you want us to survive this.

814
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,679
If this secret is exposed,

815
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,879
it won't do us any good.

816
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,360
It will affect Ju's position
as the heir of the Lord too.

817
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,239
So, let me ask you.

818
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
Do you have a plan?

819
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,719
I heard that Prince Ju managed
to defeat the bandits in the south.

820
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:25,320
It was a fruitful victory.

821
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,879
He is also in charge
of a large troop right now.

822
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,439
Now, most of Yongzhou's military forces

823
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,800
have been sent to the border
of Qingzhou by His Lordship.

824
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,959
If Prince Ju can arrest
Feng Lanxi at that time

825
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,399
in the name of cleaning up the court
for His Lordship,

826
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:49,320
then no one can ever compete
with Prince Ju

827
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,560
for the title of the Heir.

828
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,199
Besides,

829
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:57,360
you can stop anyone from finding out
about the death of the late queen.

830
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,080
So, your plan all along is to ask Ju

831
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,399
to overthrow His Lordship.

832
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,600
What if we fail?

833
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,679
This is the only way.

834
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,120
Besides, Prince Ju can now
get his wish fulfilled earlier.

835
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,840
Killing multiple birds with one stone.

836
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,399
But how should we do it?

837
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,560
What is your plan?

838
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:26,840
It'll be His Lordship's birthday
in seven days.

839
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,120
I hope that you can help me

840
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,840
get His Lordship's Military Tally.

841
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,320
I'll use the Military Tally

842
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:39,040
to let the city defense garrison
take over the Royal Army under Zhao Hai

843
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,360
for the safety of the palace.

844
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,360
At the same time,

845
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,080
you'll receive a secret letter

846
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,479
stating that Feng Lanxi
wants to use this chance to revolt

847
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,479
by sending his soldiers
to storm the palace.

848
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,800
This is where Ju will come in
to save the court.

849
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:00,679
That's indeed a good plan.

850
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:03,760
This is a grave matter.

851
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,800
I have to think about it.

852
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:11,360
I'll wait for you to come
to a decision then, Your Highness.

853
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,800
I'll take my leave now.
