00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,970
=Episode 14=
(The Soul-Eating Sword)

3
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:35,770
(Well done,)

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,640
(my little brother.)

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,600
(I love watching
you two tear each other apart.)

6
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,840
(The Night of the Crimson Moon
is almost here.)

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,640
(I can't wait to see you rip the Mei pearl
out of her heart with your own hands.)

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,079
Is Li Motong behaving?

9
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,439
He's no match for you.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Of course, he'll obey.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,960
Don't worry.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,439
I'm keeping an eye on him.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,200
You gave your word,

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,040
and helped me
become Paramount's new star.

15
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,439
I came today
to thank you properly, Mr. Jing.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,400
But you keep bringing up those two.

17
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,599
You sound so distant.

18
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,480
Are you perhaps

19
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,519
not satisfied with me?

20
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,680
I want to be your only lover.

21
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,439
My lover?

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,040
What makes you think you're worthy?

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,439
I'm a hundred times better
than that Lu Huayan.

24
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,640
From where I'm standing,

25
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,200
you're not even close.

26
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,439
Why not?

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,000
Whatever she can do, I can do too.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,879
And what she can't,

29
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,799
I can!

30
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,840
Why am I not as good as her?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Jing Haisi, tell me!
Why am I not as good as her?

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
People come in ranks.

33
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,319
Some can become my confidants,

34
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,439
the ones I trust to work for me.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,640
Others are only fit

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,519
to warm my bed,

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,439
like cattle or horses.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Sorry to say,

39
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,639
you're the latter.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,620
By the way,

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,439
that perfume you wear

42
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,599
smells awful.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,319
Lu Huayan…

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Extra! Extra!

45
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,800
Read all about it!

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
Extra! Extra!

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,639
A few words from you,
and someone's fate is sealed.

48
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,840
You must feel so proud, don't you?

49
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,680
And now, what are you doing?

50
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,919
Playing the savior?

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,039
Looking at me with pity,

52
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,599
hoping I'll be so grateful
I fall at your feet?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're soaked.

54
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,240
Save your act.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,639
I'm not falling for your traps again.

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,330
The ones who should pay for their sins

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,240
are you and your wretched brother.

58
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,199
Before the Night of the Crimson Moon,

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,919
I'll take every chance I can

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,800
to kill you both.

61
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,240
You're facing death

62
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,199
and yet you're still acting tough.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,599
Then, do it. Kill me.

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,000
What's stopping you?

65
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,479
Coward!

66
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,280
You want to die?

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,639
You still owe me.

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,039
You'll stay right here,
at my side, forever.

69
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,000
Because I enjoy the feeling

70
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,240
of having you in the palm of my hand.

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,479
It's far more satisfying
than killing you.

72
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,280
Who said you control my fate?

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,000
If you want me damned for eternity,

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,039
I'll make sure you burn with me.

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,639
Good.

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
That's my wife.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,599
Lu Huayan,

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,319
if we can't love each other,

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,839
then we'll go
to the other side together.

(This must be Miss You's bookstore.)

90
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,639
Li Motong's been quite quiet lately.

91
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,390
We just have to wait for him to take

92
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,910
the Mei pearl on the Night
of the Crimson Moon.

93
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,879
You really think
he'll give up on Lu Huayan

94
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,120
and take the pearl obediently?

95
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,480
That doesn't sound like
the Li Motong I know.

96
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,040
He has no choice.

97
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,240
His Wujian force is fading
with each passing day.

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,959
Besides,

99
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,560
I have the Soul-Eating Sword.

100
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,079
Even if he has a change of mind,

101
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
I can use it to get the pearl myself.

102
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,639
He's my brother.

103
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,240
I trust him.

104
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
He won't lie to me.

105
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,439
Lu Huayan,

106
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,560
you're finished.

107
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,199
The Night of the Crimson Moon is coming.

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,959
Your power is fading.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,300
And now they've retrieved the
Soul-Eating Sword from the Wujian Realm,

110
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,240
the one that can pierce hearts
and extract pearls.

111
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,240
Boss,

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,959
if this keeps dragging on,

113
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,390
how are we supposed
to turn things around?

114
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,480
That sword is his weapon against me,

115
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,959
but also our way to end the deadlock.

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,759
When the Night
of the Crimson Moon arrives,

117
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,040
their powers will weaken
for a short while.

118
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,720
And my Wujian force

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,839
will surge.

120
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,439
You're planning

121
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,959
to destroy the Soul-Eating Sword
that night?

122
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,439
That's the only way

123
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,959
to save Yan.

124
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,839
I only hope she'll forgive me.

125
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,220
(Ye City Morning Post)

126
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,399
I'm sure today's headline

127
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,759
must have opened your eyes.

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,439
You hold me captive in this residence.

129
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,639
So I'll see to it that there's no place
for you in the human world.

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,319
If you want me to speak out for you,
to clear your name

131
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,439
and salvage your reputation,

132
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
then let me leave the Li Residence

133
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,319
and give me my freedom.

134
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,000
Miss Zhang from the Morning Post.

135
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,959
Mr. Li from the Evening News.

136
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,839
They've promised

137
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,199
to suppress any negative news

138
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,160
about me.

139
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,720
Yan, don't you think

140
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,360
humans are even more spineless
and opportunistic

141
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
than we imagined?

142
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,600
What do you want from me?

143
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,199
You might as well kill me.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,519
You've already crushed me
under your heel.

145
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,800
Is that not humiliation enough?

146
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,639
How much more do you want to torture me?

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
It's not nearly enough.

148
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,319
You will be bound
by my side for eternity.

149
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,959
You'll never leave me.

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,439
You won't release me,

151
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,839
won't kill me,

152
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,120
and won't let me go.

153
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,720
Do you hate me that much,

154
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,920
or love me that deeply?

155
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,240

to her birthday party.

00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,480
She also requested

158
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,440
Miss Lu to attend.

159
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,919
Looks like Paramount's leading lady

160
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,799
is finally returning to the spotlight.

161
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,360
Gu Xihe.

162
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,600
Take her to get changed.
