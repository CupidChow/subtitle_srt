(The Supreme Priest's Secret)

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,839
A little more to the left.

4
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:31,839
More to the left.

5
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,479
Great.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,719
A bit closer.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,840
A little closer.

8
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:36,799
Ready.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:37,960
Three.

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,039
Two.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,439
One.

12
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,600
Wait a second.

13
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,039
What's wrong?

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
Those stories say

15
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,840
that taking a photo

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,640
might capture
the soul of the Lord of Wujian.

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,000
What if...

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,320
You actually believe those stories?

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,640
The only one who can take his soul

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,399
is his bride.

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,820
Let's get on with it.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,000
Sure.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,039
Three.

24
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,439
Two.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,599
Wait.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,000
I...

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,319
What now?

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,120
My makeup

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,280
is a bit different than usual.

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm not sure which one looks better.

31
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,079
So the famous Miss Lu

32
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,640
can actually get shy.

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,680
I care about it

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,879
because it's our first photo together.

35
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,599
You look best today.

36
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:30,840
Come on.

37
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,439
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,519
We might not

39
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,120
be able to shoot today.

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,120
This camera

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,840
is acting up.

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,079
Look over there.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Here we go.

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,240
I don't know what's wrong today.

45
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,840
I just can't get my eyebrows right.

46
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,199
How about I, the culprit, give it a try?

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,599
You actually know how to draw eyebrows?

48
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,000
You must have done it
for other girls before.

49
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,800
That's why you're so good at it.

50
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,800
You're the first person
I've ever drawn eyebrows for.

51
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,120
And I'd do it for you all my life.

52
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,639
Stay still.

53
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,680
You're gorgeous, darling.

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
(Yan.)

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,199
(A hundred years ago, you were heartbroken
because of me.)

56
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,879
(And on the Bridge of Nine Souls,
you risked your life for me.)

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,399
(As the ruler of Wujian,)

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,399
(I will never let you be hurt again.)

59
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm getting hungry.

60
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,680
Go make me something to eat.

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,040
Sure.

62
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,639
Miss Gu.

63
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,439
It's time for work, isn't it?

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,319
I quit.

65
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,279
It's me, You Zimei.

66
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,120
Miss You.

67
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,439
Miss Lu.

68
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,279
There's something I'd like
to speak to you about privately.

69
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,199
Can you come see me tomorrow?

70
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,759
I asked you here today

71
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,680
because I want this conversation

72
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
to stay between us.

73
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,879
You once told me

74
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,439
about the Bodhi Fruit.

75
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,450
I haven't forgotten that favor.

76
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,240
So don't stand on ceremony.

77
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,399
I may have told you
about the Bodhi Fruit,

78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,399
but it was I who restored
the Soul-Eating Sword.

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,600
Thus,

80
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,959
it can hardly be called a favor.

81
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
Everything I've done

82
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,040
is for the Wujian.

83
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,800
Then why did you

84
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,639
ask to see me?

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,240
I was born of the Wujian,

86
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,759
so I can't turn my back on it.

87
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,399
Your bond with him

88
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,360
is doomed to end in tragedy.

89
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,040
If the Mei pearl stays within you,

90
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,040
he can't return to Wujian.

91
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,199
Not only will he die,

92
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,079
but the Wujian will perish as well.

93
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,720
A hundred years ago,

94
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,879
the First Master fell in love
with a human woman.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They had a child

96
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,399
who was half-human by blood.

97
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,839
He could not remain
in the Wujian forever.

98
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:30,879
To save him,

99
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,240
the First Master

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,399
chose two human girls

101
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,360
to be the vessels
of the Chi and Mei pearls.

102
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,480
Your sister

103
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,279
was the vessel of the Chi pearl.

104
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,160
And you

105
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,600
are that of the Mei pearl.

106
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,560
In the face of this impossible fate,

107
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,800
Li Motong

108
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,839
chose to sacrifice himself

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
to let you live.

110
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,240
But I believe you have the right to know

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,600
and the right to choose.

112
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,000
I wonder

113
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
what your choice is.

114
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,079
He risked his life for me.

115
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,040
I, Lu Huayan, am no coward either.

116
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm willing to give up the Mei pearl

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,639
to let him live.

118
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,959
But I have one condition.

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
What condition?

120
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,159
Make him forget me.

121
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,559
Please.

122
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:52,799
Sure.

123
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,159
I promise you.

124
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,639
Thank you.

125
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,720
Although you

126
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,039
are willing to give up the Mei pearl,

127
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,399
the Soul-Eating Sword

128
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,799
is still in Li Motong's hands.

129
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:03,879
Well,

130
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,399
don't worry.

131
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,159
I'll retrieve it.

132
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,399
(Even if fate has bound us this way,)

133
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,799
(I refuse to accept it.)

134
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,559
(Li Motong.)

135
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,080
(I'm the bride of the Wujian.)

136
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,480
(I won't let you suffer for me
another hundred years.)

137
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,000
(Forget me.)

138
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,799
(Only through rebirth)

139
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,519
