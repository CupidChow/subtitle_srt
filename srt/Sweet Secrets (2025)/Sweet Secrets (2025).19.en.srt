(Hold My Hand)

3
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:55,960
Does it hurt?

4
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,439
I don't need it.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,879
I do envy Lu Huayan.

6
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,359
She has someone to protect her.

7
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,799
You're mine.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,159
I'll protect you.

9
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
You know,

10
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
ever since I was a child,
I was always the one left behind.

11
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,400
Abandoned by my parents,

12
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,719
betrayed by friends,

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,959
deceived by someone I loved.

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,599
You're the only one
who never abandoned me.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,920
Thank you.

16
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,520
Practicing your Wujian force again?

17
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,639
Did you rest well?

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,639
I'm fine.

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,919
Ever since

20
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,159
the Night of the Crimson Moon,

21
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,919
your power's been fading bit by bit.

22
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,240
Why didn't you tell me?

23
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

24
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,960
I didn't want you to worry.

25
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,039
I can handle it.

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
You should think more about yourself.

27
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,599
Whatever happens,

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you can always talk to me.

29
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,159
I'm not as fragile as you think.

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
As long as you're here,

31
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,719
Then,

33
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,840
as you wish, darling.

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,639
So,

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,360
how's your power recovery going?

36
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,719
Back on the train,

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,520
my Wujian force briefly returned.

38
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,039
But it disappeared again soon after.

39
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,520
I think

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
it has something to do
with the Mei pearl.

41
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,520
The Mei pearl?

42
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,599
But it's inside me.

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
And back on the train,

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
the only person who had close contact

45
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,000
with you was me.

46
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,520
Don't tell me…

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,800
You've figured something out, darling?

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,360
I think I have.

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,639
Like this?

50
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,959
Maybe not.

51
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,360
You were holding me tighter,
weren't you?

52
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Like this?

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,240
Try again.

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,800
Still not working.

55
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,720
I think I've got it.

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
Back on the train,

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,199
we were holding hands tightly.

58
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,519
Give me your hand.

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,199
Try it now.

60
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,120
Was it the power company?

61
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
Do it again.

62
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't believe

63
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,560
the Mei pearl inside me

64
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,000
can actually restore your Wujian force.

65
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,959
Let's stay like this,

66
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,800
hand in hand, forever.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
I'll give you all the energy

68
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,920
I have inside me.

69
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,199
Yan,

70
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,759
I'm glad I have you.

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,519
What's wrong?

72
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
The lights went out again.

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
Time for bed.

74
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
I made you breakfast.

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,600
Try it.

76
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,319
You made breakfast dressed like that?

77
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,920
So what?

78
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,759
Life needs a touch of ceremony.

79
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,360
Why are you cooking for me?

80
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I'm your personal assistant now.

81
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
This is part of the job.

82
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't want to eat this.

83
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,720
What do you want to eat?

84
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Steamed lamb? Steamed bear's paw?

85
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,660
Steamed deer tail?
Roast duck? Roasted young chicken?

86
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,120
Roast goose?

87
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,520
Or maybe braised pork?

88
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,560
Braised duck? Soy sauce chicken?
Smoked meat? Processed tripe?

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
I'll make it right now.

90
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,759
I don't want any of that.

91
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,720
Then what do you want?

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,399
I want…

93
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,240
meatballs.

94
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,240
Meatballs?

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,879
I can make those.

96
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,360
Red meatballs, white meatballs,
Nanjing-style meatballs,

97
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,420
four-delight meatballs,
three-delicacy meatballs, poached meatballs.

98
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,720
Which kind do you want?

99
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
I've lost my appetite.

100
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,519
Because…

101
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,759
you're finished.

102
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,360
Then what should I make?

103
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,689
Steamed lamb, steamed bear's paw,

104
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:10,045
steamed deer tail, roast duck,

105
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,190
roasted young chicken, roast goose…

106
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,090
Braised pork, braised duck,
soy sauce chicken, smoked meat…

107
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,320
Red meatballs, white meatballs,

108
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,888
Nanjing-style meatballs,
four-delight meatballs,

109
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,220
three-delicacy meatballs,
poached meatballs…

110
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,120
