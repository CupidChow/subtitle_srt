(Let's Go To Hell Together)

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,520
Did you really think I ever loved you?

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,000
I never loved you.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,880
All the affection, intimacy,

6
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,600
and vows

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,759
we once had...

8
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,320
They were nothing but an act.

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,399
I got close to you

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,200
and made you fall for me

11
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,079
to find out the truth
behind my sister's death.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,600
So you wouldn't bear to harm me

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,519
and take the Mei pearl.

14
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,519
But you turned out to be
the one who killed my sister!

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,799
So I couldn't bring myself

16
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
to keep up the act.

17
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,719
I don't believe

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,680
what you're saying.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,599
Since it was all an act,

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,000
of course I had to make it look real.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,280
Otherwise,

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,680
a monster who's lived
for hundreds of years like you

23
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,159
wouldn't fall for my trap.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Stay out of my life.

25
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,680
Don't ever bother me again.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,319
Otherwise, that silver bullet

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,519
will pierce right through your heart.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,879
Mr. Jing, I'll wait for you
in the dressing room.

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,159
He gave me this.
It's actually quite lovely.

30
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,159
- Lu.
- Lu.

31
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,480
What's it with her?

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,680
I have no idea.

33
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,080
Close the door.

34
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,120
I saw you and Mr. Li part on bad terms.

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,080
Did you fight?

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,000
No, we didn't.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
We've completely gone our separate ways.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,560
Have you had a misunderstanding?

39
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,479
Mr. Li has truly adored you.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
It shouldn't have come to this.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,879
There's no misunderstanding.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,199
He adored me

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,319
because he saw me as a mere replacement.

44
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,360
The one he truly loves

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,159
is another woman.

46
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,240
And I

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,919
was just a substitute.

48
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,560
Silly girl.

49
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,080
As long he treats you sincerely,

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
why dwell on being a substitute?

51
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,120
You need not care too much about that.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
What matters most

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,520
is asking your heart

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
if he's truly the one.

55
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,120
But is he the one though?

56
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,120
He doesn't love me.

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,759
He even killed my sister.

58
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,120
It's a blood feud between us.

59
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,520
How could I ever love him?

60
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,479
If so, let him go completely.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,680
Whether you move forward

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,879
or take a step back,

63
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,560
don't trap yourself in a rut.

64
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,680
Being stubborn

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,319
will only hurt you more.

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,319
There, there.

67
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,280
What should I do?

68
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,120
There, there.

69
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,399
Let her go.

70
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,600
My good brother.

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,879
She's about to be my wife.

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,839
Jing Haisi.

73
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,879
I've made up my mind.

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,639
You win.

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,000
I agree to remove the Mei pearl.

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,199
A wise man knows when to yield.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,519
You're not entirely foolish.

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,079
When will you do so?

79
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,399
The Mei pearl isn't with me now.

80
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,199
And my Wujian force is fading by the day.

81
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,240
I don't even know
if I'll last until then.

82
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,800
You must give her back to me.

83
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
Why should I?

84
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,240
On the night of the Crimson Moon,
I'll carve out her heart

85
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,839
and retrieve the Mei pearl.

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
But before that,

87
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,839
I'll torture her every day

88
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
and make her hate me to the core.

89
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,279
Great.

90
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,279
I'd like to see
how you're going to torture her.

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,839
Once her heart breaks completely,

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll cut her heart out.

93
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,399
That sounds fun.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's more like it.

95
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,399
Humans are nothing but tools to us.

96
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,079
We can make this deal happen.

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,240
However,

98
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll have someone watch you every day.

99
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,639
Don't you dare play tricks
under my nose.

100
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,000
Extra! Extra!

101
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,199
Lu Huayan has been expelled
from the Paramount by the chief inspector!

102
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,160
Extra! Extra!

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Miss Lu, you still have the nerve
to show up here.

104
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,439
Didn't you know?

105
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,800
The chief inspector

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,040
has already ordered your expulsion
from the Paramount.

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,279
From this day forward,

108
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,639
you're no longer part of the Paramount.

109
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,959
A woman as vicious as you

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,759
has no place here.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,199
So you brought me back here

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,279
just to humiliate me

113
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,959
and get back at me?

114
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,240
You're quite perceptive.

115
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,800
Your death is near.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,199
Kill me, then!

117
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,240
Guess what I'm afraid of. Death or you?

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,639
Want to die?

119
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,879
It's not time yet.

120
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,800
Since Lu Huayan is no longer
with the Paramount,

121
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,720
Mr. Li,

122
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,519
why don't you slap her twice

123
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,720
to cheer me up?

124
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
You can't bring yourself to do it, huh?

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,279
I'll do it myself.

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,480
Has that cheered you up?

127
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,279
Feeling satisfied?

128
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,720
Happy now?

129
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,879
Wretched girl.

130
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,000
Mr. Li.

131
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,160
If Mr. Jing finds out
that you still feel guilty towards her,

132
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm afraid he won't be pleased.

133
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
Miss Lu.

134
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
A vicious woman like you

135
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,079
isn't worthy of being
the Paramount's top performer.

136
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,319
I think Gu Meng is far more suitable.

137
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,920
After all, she's more popular than you.

138
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,399
I'm honored and grateful

139
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,879
by your favor, Mr. Li.

140
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,319
Both of you are nothing
but birds of a feather.

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,360
You're just the same.

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,720
Miss Lu.

143
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,319
Didn't you hear what Mr. Li just said?

144
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,759
From now on,

145
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,720
I, Gu Meng,

146
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,279
shall be the Paramount's top performer.

147
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,360
And you

148
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,600
will forever walk
with your tail between your legs.

149
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,680
Li Motong.

150
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
You are both pathetic

151
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,079
and despicable.

152
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,279
Mr. Li.

153
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,800
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

154
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,079
Don't tell me
you're going after Lu Huayan?

155
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,160
None of your business.

156
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,920
Of course
it's got everything to do with me.

157
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,920
I've received Mr. Jing's order

158
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,879
to keep an eye on you.

159
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,160
He wouldn't want you to break the promise

160
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,279
and get back together with Miss Lu.

161
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
Naturally, I need to grasp
your whereabouts.

162
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,120
You're nothing but Jing Haisi's lapdog.

163
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,279
Who do you think you are
to be talking to me?

164
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,279
What did you say?

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
What did you say?

166
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,879
