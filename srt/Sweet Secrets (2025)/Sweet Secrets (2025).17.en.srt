(The Sweet Lie)

3
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,120
Yan.

4
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,040
You're finally awake.

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,319
How silly of you.

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Why were you at the Nine Soul Bridge?

7
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
It was a bottomless abyss down there.

8
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,640
If you fell, that'd be terrible.

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,239
You've always protected me before.

10
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,280
I wanted to protect you this time.

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,120
You're my wife.

12
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,960
It's my duty to protect you.

13
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
I just want to hold you like this.

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,439
All the time.

15
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,879
I want to always be with you

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
and lead a peaceful life.

17
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,159
Nothing

18
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,680
could ever separate us again.

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,639
Not even death

20
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,159
could tear us apart.

21
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,080
Yes.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
We'll never be apart again.

23
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,719
Lu Huayan was able to reenter the dream
and retrieve the Bodhi Fruit.

24
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,479
Did you help him?

25
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,280
(Li Motong)
I helped Li Motong.

26
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,319
As the Supreme Priest of Wujian,

27
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,760
I couldn't just stand by
and watch the Lord of Wujian

28
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,240
suffer from the Heart-Devouring Curse.

29
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,159
He brought all of this upon himself!

30
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,960
If he had followed the plan,

31
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,639
he wouldn't be suffering like this.

32
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,360
Due to what he did,

33
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,879
even the Soul-Eating Sword is gone now.

34
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,990
Tell me. What do we do now?

35
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,520
I'm willing to sacrifice all my power

36
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,840
to reforge the sword's soul.

37
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,280
For real?

38
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,510
When that time comes,

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,380
the Soul-Eating Sword
infused with all my power

40
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,840
will be even stronger than before.

41
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,420
We'll no longer need to wait
until the night of the Crimson Moon.

42
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,879
You're sacrificing so much

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,639
just to keep Li Motong alive,
aren't you?

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
It's been hundreds of years

45
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,120
and you still love him.

46
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,959
Three days from now,

47
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,460
the Soul-Eating Sword will be complete.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
We'll decide what to do then.

49
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,480
See your way out.

50
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,759
So that's how it is.

51
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,959
He's a fool.

52
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,079
So are you.

53
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
Yan, we're done for the day.

54
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,480
Today's rehearsal went really well.

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,670
Thank you for your hard work.

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
I'll off.

57
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,990
What are you doing here?

58
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,480
Lu Huayan.

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,079
Why?

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,360
Why can I never surpass you?

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,079
Why are you always ahead of me?

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,759
No matter how hard I try,

63
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,839
why do you always
manage to steal my limelight?

64
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,000
Why?

65
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,079
Gu Meng.

66
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,560
You're nothing but Jing Haisi's lapdog.

67
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,600
Haven't you heard the saying
"you are who you surround yourself with"?

68
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,199
I was lenient enough
to have kicked you out of the Paramount.

69
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,720
Lu Huayan, you're wrong.

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,839
I'm no longer the Gu Meng I used to be.

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,079
Now, not only can I disfigure you,

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,399
but I can also take your life

73
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,839
as easily as crushing an ant.

74
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,759
You think you're worthy
of being part of Wujian?

75
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,680
I'll take back
your Wujian force right now.

76
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,240
I don't care about others,

77
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,120
but don't you dare touch what's mine!

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,800
Li Motong!

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,720
I am

80
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,720
yours?

81
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,600
You belong to Wujian.

82
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,439
I don't mind having another helper.

83
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,759
Yet from now on,

84
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,439
don't interfere in human affairs.

85
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,879
But I joined Wujian

86
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,680
to help you with your work.

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,399
Like I said,

88
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,079
stay out

89
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,439
of Wujian's business.

90
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,639
(The Wujian force
grows weaker by the day.)

91
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,360
(I must find another way.)

92
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,040
Darling.

93
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,240
Li Motong.

94
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
Are you hiding something from me?

95
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,199
What could I possibly
be hiding from you?

96
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,720
With your power,

97
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,720
how could you have lost to Jing Haisi?

98
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,690
Is the backlash from the Mei pearl
getting worse?

99
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,240
Did the Bodhi Fruit not work?

100
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,639
You're overthinking.

101
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,519
Everyone slips up sometimes.

102
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,079
Don't be so on edge.

103
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,040
But Miss You and Jing Haisi said

104
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,290
that you'll die
if you don't take back the Mei pearl.

105
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,639
Yet you told me
that as long as you ate the Bodhi Fruit,

106
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,199
you'd be fine.

107
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,399
Don't worry, darling.

108
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm really fine.

109
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,399
Right now, what matters most

110
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,080
is You Zimei actually
gave Gu Meng inhuman powers.

111
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,399
It's not safe for you to go out alone.

112
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,399
For now,

113
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,039
don't go to the Paramount.

114
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,799
Are you sure you're all right?

115
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes, darling. I'm fine.

116
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,120
Alright, then.

117
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,039
I can't do anything with you.

118
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll ask Lan for some time off

119
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,039
to take care of you.

120
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,240
Who's taking care of whom here?

121
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,879
Things are dangerous right now.

122
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,519
From today on,

123
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,240
you have to stay
by my side at all times.

124
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,440
If we're always together like this,

125
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,720
your subordinates
will start teasing you.

126
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,600
They'd call you a maniac
who dotes on his wife.

127
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,480
A maniac who dotes on his wife?

128
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
I actually like the sound of that.

129
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
