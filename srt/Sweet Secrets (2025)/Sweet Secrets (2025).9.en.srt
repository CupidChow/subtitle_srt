(Wujian's Punishment)

- Chief Inspector!
- Chief Inspector!

4
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:35,960
Mr. Li,

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,439
I have a few questions for you.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,119
Mr. Li.

7
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,240
Is it true
that you shot Commander Jiang dead?

8
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,799
Mr. Li, please answer my question.

9
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,039
Mr. Li.

10
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,600
Rumors say that you admire Miss Lu.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,280
Your lust for her
caused you to kill someone.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,439
Do you have anything
to explain to the people?

13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,399
Everything you've heard is not true.

14
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,640
I hold responsibility
for Killing Commander Jiang.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,850
It has nothing to do with other people.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
I will
give the public an explanation later.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,479
All of you are professional reporters.

18
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,240
Thrusting someone into the spotlight

19
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,399
might not be too appropriate.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,479
If there's nothing else,

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,719
please go back.

22
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,959
Mr. Li, say something.

23
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,359
Is this true?

24
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,480
Is this true?

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,480
Wait for me at home.

26
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,879
I will deal with this.

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,239
Send Miss Lu back.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,760
Yes.

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,660
Mr. Li, are the rumors true?

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,460
Mr. Li, answer me.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,840
Mr. Li, please answer my question.

32
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,040
Mr. Li!

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Boss,

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,599
you killed someone in the Mortal Realm for her.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,200
I have a bad feeling about it.

36
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,120
This is bad.

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,879
The Supreme Priest
has come to the Mortal Realm.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Li Motong.

39
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,159
You broke the Wujian Rules
because of Lu Huayan

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,439
and got struck by lightning.

41
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,000
Is this even worth it?

42
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,520
It is.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,840
We meet again, Miss Lu.

44
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,840
Mr. Jing,

45
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,409
you keep trespassing on my house
time and again.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,599
Why are you doing this?

47
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,919
Of course, it's for your Mei pearl.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,240
Mei pearl?

49
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't think so.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,120
I think

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,479
I'll kill you first!

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,080
He even gave you a gun.

53
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,520
How loyal.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,680
What are you trying to do?

55
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,240
Let go of me!

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,840
Li Motong will die without Mei pearl.

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,800
You are just a petri dish
for the Mei pearl

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,919
yet you keep putting him in danger.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,080
You are an evil woman.

60
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,240
You were trying to kill me
a few days ago.

61
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,280
Your words cannot be trusted.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,800
You don't believe me?

63
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,479
Li Motong killed Jiang Mingfeng.

64
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,319
He is now being punished at Wujian.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,280
Do you want to see it?

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,479
He's being punished?

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,719
Where is he?

68
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
Where is he?

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
You want to see it?

70
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,800
I'll bring you there.

71
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,479
Li Motong!

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,000
Yan.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,399
Li Motong.

74
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,639
Jing Haisi, why did you bring her here?

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Li Motong!

76
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,920
Take her away!

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,480
Look at the disaster you bring.

78
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,240
Do you see how much suffering
you've caused him?

79
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,439
Yan, leave.

80
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,439
Yan!

81
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,639
How can all of you be so cruel?

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,120
Let him go!

83
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,000
Aren't you quite capable?

84
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,079
Save him yourself.

85
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,399
Yan, leave now!

86
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,519
He has endured so much pain for you.

87
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,199
He even kneeled to me

88
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,600
for your soul.

89
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,399
Without your Mei pearl,

90
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
he will die soon.

91
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,199
I'm the one being punished,

92
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,000
not him.

93
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,839
Jing Haisi, let go of him.

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,350
I'm willing to be punished on his behalf.

95
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:23,879
Sure.

96
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,680
Kneel down, then.

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:27,959
Beg me.

98
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,319
Jing Haisi, you...

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't listen to him.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,839
No.

101
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,399
No, Yan!

102
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,199
Don't kneel to him, Yan!

103
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,399
I beg you.

104
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,839
Please save him.

105
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,000
How sincere.

106
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,839
I beg you.

107
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,680
Please save him!

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
However, you kneeled for nothing.

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,480
I was just fooling around with you.

110
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,600
What must I do for you to let go of Yan?

111
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,720
Li Motong.

112
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,120
I won't take her away.

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,399
I'm going to let her be punished
together with you.

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
I won't kill her.

115
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,639
However, I have
thousands of ways to torture her.

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Humans are lowly.

117
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,240
She is just a vessel for the Mei pearl.

118
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
Death is her only fate.

119
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,839
I've told you

120
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,000
that the Mei pearl is my matter alone.

121
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,040
I don't need you to interfere.

122
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,720
Jing Haisi,

123
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,439
I order you as the Lord of Wujian

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
to get out of Wujian

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,519
and never come back.

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,120
As expected of my younger brother.

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,000
You are the Lord of Wujian indeed.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,519
This is not over between us yet.

129
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,160
Li Motong.

130
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,920
For you,

131
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
everything I do is worth it.

132
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,399
Thank you,

133
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,000

that if you insist on
not taking the Mei pearl,

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
you will really die.

But you...

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,360
You kneeled to Jing Haisi

154

to get my soul back.

155
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
You also killed a human to protect me

but it is real
