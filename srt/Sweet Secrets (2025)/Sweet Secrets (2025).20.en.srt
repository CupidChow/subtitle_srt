(The Bride of Wujian)

3
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,119
I knew you'd come to accuse me.

4
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,760
It was I who used all my spiritual power
to repair the soul-eating sword.

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,639
But when I did that,

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,199
it wasn't meant to target Miss Lu.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,559
I only wanted you to stay alive.

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,320
You're the supreme priest of Wujian,

9
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,400
dedicated to preserving Wujian's peace.

10
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:54,599
It's your duty.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,039
I don't blame you.

12
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,719
Now that the sword is in my hand,

13
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,719
none of you can hurt her.

14
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,400
Do you love her that much?

15
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,360
Yes.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,519
Till death, unwavering.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,719
Perhaps now,
things have taken a new turn.

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,159
Your spiritual powers are now merging.

19
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,480
This means that

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
Lu Huayan is no longer
the vessel of the Mei pearl.

21
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,440
So what does that mean?

22
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,119
It means that

23
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,440
the Mei pearl has already
recognised Lu Huayan as its master.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,400
Even if you refuse
to take the Mei pearl,

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,800
I still have a way

26
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,719
to let both of you live.

27
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,320
That's great.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Then I'll entrust

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,159
all of this to you.

30
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,039
I'm sorry I lied to you.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,039
You and Lu Huayan
can never both survive.

32
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,519
Everything I've done

33
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,800
was for Wujian.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,719
Darling, why are you
staring at me like that?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,320
Because my husband looks so handsome,

36
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,920
it's hard to resist.

37
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:42,920
Then I'll just

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
give in to my darling's temptation.

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
You still have to go to work.

40
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,159
From today on,

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,599
you must stay by my side at all times.

42
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,039
Put on your hat.

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,159
Let's go.

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,719
I haven't put on my coat yet.

45
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,920
I heard our commander's wife
is very pretty.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,800
Of course she is.

47
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,840
Let me introduce everyone.

48
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,960
This is my wife.

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,239
- Hello, madam.
- Hello, madam.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hello, everyone.

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,719
Please sit.

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,159
Sit down.

53
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,440
How's the investigation

54
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,639
into capturing Jing Haisi?

55
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,519
According to your order,

56
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,360
we've already raided the Jing residence.

57
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,559
But the place was empty.

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,320
Jing Haisi has clearly fled.

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,719
We've tightened control
across the whole city.

60
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:58,920
Good work.

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,639
My wife is thirsty.

62
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,440
Pour her some tea.

63
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,440
Try it.

64
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,519
Please have some tea, madam.

65
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,519
Continue.

66
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,440
I'll take charge
of the citywide search for Jing Haisi.

67
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,079
We've blocked off the docks first.

68
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,800
And the train station.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,239
He hasn't left Ye City.

70
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,519
But it's as if he's vanished
from the mortal realm.

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,159
Expand the search area.

72
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,119
Yes, sir.

73
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,800
My wife's chair isn't comfortable.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,599
Bring in a sofa.

75
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,679
No need.

76
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm comfortable sitting here.

77
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,360
Then let's continue.

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,719
We also investigated
Jing Haisi's social connections.

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,000
We found he only had business partners.

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,960
He didn't socialize much with others.

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,920
Good work, everyone.

82
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,599
From today onward,

83
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,880
strictly guard my wife's safety.

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,360
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,119
Are you satisfied, darling?

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,719
I'm more than satisfied.

87
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,559
Meeting adjourned.

88
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:03,599
What about me?

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,390
You too, leave.

90
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,400
Alright.

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,760
Why are you two still here?

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes, sir.

93
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:21,920
Darling.

94
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,599
From today on,

95
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:24,880
you must stay with me

96
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,119
every minute of every day,

97
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,119
never apart.

98
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:28,840
Alright.

99
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,360
I want to take you somewhere.

100
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,760
That long meeting is finally over.

101
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,159
At last, I have time with my wife

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,119
to talk about ourselves.

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,599
If your human subordinates

104
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,119
knew their commander was lovestruck,

105
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,920
they'd probably laugh at you.

106
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,400
Laugh?

107
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
I think they'd be jealous
of the love between my wife and me.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Mr. Li,

109
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,760
don't flatter yourself.

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,880
But

111
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,239
why did you bring me here today?

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,239
Yan,

113
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,599
I once lost all our memories.

114
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,039
I thought
that after these hundreds of years,

115
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,400
I could live alone like this,

116
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,559
enjoying a life with no one beside me,

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
no one to talk to.

118
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,519
But each time I woke
from a dream at midnight,

119
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,119
I felt a piece of my heart missing.

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,760
Until the Mei pearl guided me

121
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
to find you.

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,760
Mr. Li,

123
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,559
how much more do you have to say to me?

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,320
The Mei pearl awakened all my memories,

125
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,559
and the love buried for centuries.

126
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,239
I remember everything now.

127
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,920
Even though you remember nothing,

128
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,119
I'm already content.

129
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,920
I just want to stay by your side,

130
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,159
close to you.

131
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,159
When you're happy,

132
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,239
I'll laugh with you.

133
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,760
When you're sad, I'll wipe your tears.

134
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,360
When it rains,
I'll hold an umbrella for you.

135
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,599
The two of us

136
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,559
can just sit quietly like this,

137
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,559
watching the sun rise and set.

138
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,559
A cup of wine,

139
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,960
a pot of tea,

140
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,159
perfect.

141
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,559
Yan,

142
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,439
I must thank you
for letting go of your hatred,

143
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,520
and seeing Wujian anew.

144
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Mr. Li,

145
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,760
have you had designs on me all along?

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,359
To win my willing heart,

147
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,560
and my lifelong devotion?

148
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,720
That's right.

149
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,159
Lu Huayan,

150
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,640
will you be my

151
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
one and only bride,

152
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,279
destined for me through

153
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,000
all lifetimes?

154
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,560
I am willing.
