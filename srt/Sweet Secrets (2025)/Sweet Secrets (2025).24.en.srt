(Destiny)

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,879
Go, quickly.

5
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not leaving.

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,760
Foolish human.

7
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,439
You can't bear this.

8
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,840
Go!

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,439
Return the Chi pearl to your body now,

10
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,879
or you'll die.

11
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,879
I no longer have the power
to draw the Mei pearl back into me.

12
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,239
I've always hated letting others
see me in a pathetic state.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,920
Get out!

14
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,000
I told you,

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,079
I'll stay by your side.

16
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,239
(Jing Haisi,)

17
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,799
(don't forget me.)

18
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,599
(I'll use the little power I have left,)

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,640
(to return the Chi pearl to your body.)

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,000
(Jing Haisi,)

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,359
(that night, the price
I paid for our exchange)

22
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,840
(was to lose my love forever.)

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,479
(I regret it.)

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
What's her name?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,039
She's a dancer from Shanghai.

26
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,080
Her name is Gu Meng.

27
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,840
Gu Meng!

28
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,039
Your perfume

29
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,479
smells awful.

30
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,319
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,879
You're not the only one

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,919
who cares about Wujian.

33
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,240
Li Motong.

34
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,120
Thank you.

35
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,840
If you have time to talk nonsense,

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,240
use it to repair the cracks
in Wujian instead.

37
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,599
What I owed you,

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
I've returned it.

39
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,560
Are you alright?

40
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,560
Jing Haisi.

41
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,319
All these years I've been against you,

42
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,560
because I knew
she was your fated calamity of love.

43
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,199
I only wanted you to live.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,800
But I still couldn't change your fate.

45
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,160
The Mei pearl
has now merged with her body.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,240
If Wujian is to be saved,

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,519
it'll depend on her choice.

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
This is our destiny.

49
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,439
Li Motong,

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,560

do we know each other?

132
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,679
Are you dressed up

133
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,320
as Li Motong?

134
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,440
So?

135
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,200
For the Li Motong in your novel,

136
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,799
am I the best choice?

137
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,600
When I wrote Li Motong,

138
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
I thought of you.

139
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,759
I've always felt that between us,

140
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,000
there was love across lifetimes.

141
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
But in my story,

142
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,759
Li Motong always says,

143
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,919
if we cannot love each other,

144
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,960
then let's go to hell together.

145
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,399
Isn't that

146
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
a bit too tragic?

147
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,759
Hearing you say that,

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,120
perhaps it is.

149
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,000
Then let's change it.

150
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,639
Since we love each other so deeply,

151
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,960
let's stay together forever.

152
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,759
