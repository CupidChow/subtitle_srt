(Crimson Truth)

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,640
You Zimei.

4
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,920
When did you tell her I'd die
because of the Mei pearl?

5
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,040
And when did you tell her
to offer me the pearl?

6
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,439
Don't think that because
you're the Supreme Priest of Wujian,

7
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,920
I wouldn't dare touch you.

8
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,200
If you dare to manipulate my wife again,

9
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,959
I'll kill you.

10
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,760
That's right.

11
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,560
I lied to her.

12
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,319
I was selfish.

13
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,120
But I only wanted you to live.

14
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,560
No one can stop my decision.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,519
This is yours.

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,519
Take it back.

17
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,080
(After all these years of struggle,)

18
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,639
(we were both
just pawns in Father's game.)

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,520
(The Chi and the Mei can never reunite,)

20
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,479
(and Wujian is about to perish.)

21
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,280
(Brother,)

22
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,800
(in the Prison of Beasts,)

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,080
(you took the blow meant for me,)

24
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,919
(I won't forget it.)

25
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,840
(Forgive me.)

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
From now on,

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,319
you don't have to live here anymore.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Mr. Jing.

29
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,879
Are you driving me away?

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,000
What's the point of you staying here?

31
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,000
It's alright.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,599
Let me stay by your side.

33
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,840
Wherever you go, I'll go.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
Whatever you need, I'll become that.

35
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,039
As long as you let me stay.

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,479
As long as I'm with you.

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,560
You said

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,639
you wouldn't abandon me.

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,039
You didn't lie,

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,199
did you?

41
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm just that fickle,

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,080
and who are you pretending to be so pitiful for?

43
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,840
Pack your things and get out.

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,300
♪What is striking
inside the cold coffin?♪

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,580

♪Take me to unearth

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Right.

51
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,039
What is love worth anyway?

52
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,800
Our fate has already been decided,

53
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,919
but in this life,

54
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,960
you shouldn't have to
bear the pain again.

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
Lanyue and I
once defied the Wujian Rules,

56
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,360
and fell in love.

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,519
Father and Mother's union
already brought shame upon Wujian.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
Father planted the Mei pearl
within you and your sister,

59
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,600
so that we could never
love each other through lifetimes.

60
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,319
But in our past life, you died for me.

61
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,399
I swore an oath,

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
never to betray you,

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,199
to protect you forever.

64
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,319
Wujian

65
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,319
then sealed my memories.

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,920
Please, open your eyes and look at me.

67
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,800
I beg you.

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,279
Please.

69
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,079
Please, just open your eyes
and look at me once.

70
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,959
In the dream realm, the Mei pearl's
light reawakened my memories.

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,279
I knew then,

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,040
our fate continues in this life.

73
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,759
Lanyue,

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,639
I've finally found you.

75
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,639
So,

76
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,160
we're destined to love each other,

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,480
yet destined to part again.

78
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,279
Aren't we?

79
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,480
That's the very rule I intend to change.

80
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,439
A thousand years ago,
you took a blade for me.

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,040
I won't let you suffer the same fate.

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,040
Lu Huayan,

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,839
if you die,

84
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,519
I'll never live alone again.

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,360
Li Motong,

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,759
whether I'm Lanyue

87
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,240
or Lu Huayan,

88
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,639
whatever the rules or fate,

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,279
I've made my choice.

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,040
Even if the heavens fall,

91
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,879
I'll still go forward,

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
to be with you.

93
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,879
(What must come,)

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,360
(will come eventually.)

95
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,160
(The mortal realm
will soon fall into chaos.)

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,680
The Gate of Wujian is about to collapse.

97
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,360
Wujian's fate hangs by a thread.

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,360
I must return to Wujian

99
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,079
to save it.

100
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,879
I'll go with you.

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,959
The Mei pearl is within me.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,639
Wujian's fate is tied to mine as well.

103
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,879
Take me back.

104
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,160
Let's face it together.
