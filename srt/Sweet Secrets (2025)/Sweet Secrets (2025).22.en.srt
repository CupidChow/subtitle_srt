(The Choice)

3
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,399
What's on your mind, darling?

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,799
Come home with me for a visit.

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,399
Sure.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,799
This is my greenhouse.

7
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,200
This

8
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
is a gardenia.

9
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,400
Before it blooms in midsummer,
it needs plenty of water.

10
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,040
After it blooms,

11
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,560
you should water it less.

12
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,640
This flower

13
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,959
is called a hydrangea.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,159
It loves shade and avoids sun.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,159
It likes moisture but not flooding.

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,959
It needs frequent watering,

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,079
but never too much at once.

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,480
This flower

19
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,159
is my favorite.

20
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,560
It's called forget-me-not.

21
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,000
Because even in winter,

22
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,879
it still blooms,

23
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,640
making it the most resilient flower.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
Are you're telling me all this

25
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
because you want me
to help you take care of them?

26
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,280
I just wanted to show you

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,039
my favorite flowers.

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,080
Besides, with me around,

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,240
why would I need your help?

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm more than willing

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,039
to be your gardener.

32
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,800
Then let me test you.

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,879
The hydrangea I mentioned,

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,400
how should you tend to it?

35
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,360
I knew you didn't memorize it.

36
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,599
When we get back tonight,

37
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,599
I'll write down all the flowers

38
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,840
in a notebook.

39
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,639
You'd better memorize them.

40
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,039
Looks like to win your heart,

41
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,319
I need to

42
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,759
be dedicated.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
You smooth talker.

44
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,159
I recognize this flower.

45
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,159
Magnolia.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,759
The flower language of magnolia is

47
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,599
pure and sincere love.

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,840
When the magnolia blooms,

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
you're the only one in my eyes.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,680
So it's only a matter of time

51
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,879
until the fall of Wujian.

52
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,639
A century ago,

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the First Master foresaw this disaster.

54
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,199
So he put the Chi and Mei pearls
into two humans.

55
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,240
That way, you and Li Motong

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,800
could draw strength from them.

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,200
And more importantly,

58
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,040
so that the two of you

59
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,000
could unite to save the day.

60
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,040
So Li Motong and I

61
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,040
were nothing but Father's pawns.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,759
Does he know?

63
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,680
Now, for Miss Lu's sake,

64
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,160
Li Motong
is willing to give up his life,

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
refusing to take the Mei pearl.

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,839
All I can do is take a bet

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,759
on whether Lu Huayan
would sacrifice herself for Li Motong

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
and remove the Mei pearl.

69
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,759
So…

70
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,000
who will truly save Wujian?

71
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,879
Boss.

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,319
Have you found them?

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
I've searched everywhere,

74
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,120
but still no sign.

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Work harder on the search.

76
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,879
Search the whole city.

77
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,720
Boss, where are you going?

78
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,399
(If the Mei pearl stays within you,)

79
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,279
(he can't return to Wujian.)

80
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,120
(Not only will he die,)

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
(but the Wujian will perish as well.)

82
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,879
(But I believe
you have the right to know)

83
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,519
(and the right to choose.)

84
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,560
Let go!

85
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:29,879
Let go!

86
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,600
I won't.

87
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,399
Let go!

88
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,319
I said no!

89
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,360
Lu Huayan.

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,879
Why would you

91
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,160
sacrifice your life for me?

92
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,279
You've always been
the one protecting me.

93
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,319
Let me protect you just this once.

94
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,720
Please, let me protect you for once!

95
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,360
Lu Huayan.

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,759
I only wish for you to live well.

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,319
But I can't

98
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,680
use your life

99
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
to buy my own meaningless survival.

100
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,279
If only one of us can live,

101
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,959
I want it to be you.

102
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,720
Lu Huayan!

103
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,519
You once said

104
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,680
one must live for himself.

105
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,800
You could do it.

106
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,160
And you still can do it.

107
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
But since the moment I met you,

108
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,079
I'm no longer Lu Huayan!

109
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,800
And I'm no longer Li Motong!

110
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Lu Huayan.

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
I just want you to live.

112
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
If you're gone,

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,759
what am I supposed to do?

114
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,879
You must live well.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,560
But…

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,160
You're from Wujian,

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,480
and I'm from the human world.

118
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,120
We're from different worlds, yet our love remains.

119
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,519
Our meeting
was destined to be a mistake.

120
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,680
No.

121
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,879
It wasn't a mistake.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Li Motong.

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,920
Just let me protect you this once.

124
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,519
I want you to live.

125
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,879
I told you.

126
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,959
I don't need it.

127
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,120
Just stay here.

128
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,360
