=Episode 16=
(The Nine Soul Bridge)

3
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,759
What's wrong, Li Motong?

4
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,719
Are you cold?

5
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,520
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,679
You wouldn't be suffering like this

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,079
if it weren't for me.

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,920
It's all my fault.

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,520
I should've trusted you.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,119
I should've loved you.

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,959
You Zimei.

12
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,599
You Zimei must have a way.

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Wait here.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,400
I'll be back.

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,760
Don't go…

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,480
Yan…

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,079
Yan…

18
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,159
Miss You!

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,159
Miss You!

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,480
He's wracked with agonizing pain
from the Mei pearl's recoil.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,519
Miss You!

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Can you save him? Please!

23
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,159
You Zimei!

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
You Zimei!

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,879
You Zimei!

26
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,920
How's Li Motong?

27
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,519
He…

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,199
he's hurting badly.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,510
Please, I'm begging you, save him.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,879
You don't blame me?

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,960
I don't.

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,560
Just save him.

33
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,800
Please save him.

34
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,960
There is a way,

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,879
but you'll have to go

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,390
to an extremely dangerous place.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,120
Will you

38
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,759
go there?

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,199
I will.

40
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,000
If it means saving him,

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
I'll go through blades and fire,

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
thunder and storms,

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,280
even down to the deepest abyss.

44
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,490
I've restored the dream disc.

45
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,590
Inside the dream realm,
there's a thousand-year-old Bodhi Tree.

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,590
Its Bodhi Fruit can ease
the suffering of the afflicted heart.

47
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,400
Miss Lu,

48
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,080
if you will risk everything for him,

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,240
follow me

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
into the dream disc.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,290
Once inside the dream realm,

52
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,670
you must cross the Nine Soul Bridge

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
to obtain the Bodhi Fruit.

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,960
On that bridge,

55
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,120
all your past and present lives
will be revealed.

56
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,759
If your soul falters while crossing,

57
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,560
you'll be consumed

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,080
by agony beyond bearing.

59
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,159
You're mortal

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,319
and already wounded all over.

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,759
Lu Huayan,

62
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,080
are you sure

63
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,159
you want to cross the bridge?

64
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,520
I will.

65
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,280
I'll get the Bodhi Fruit.

66
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll save him.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,599
Lu Huayan,

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
you think
you can cross the Nine Soul Bridge?

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Those who defy fate
will have their souls torn apart.

70
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,950
Go back to the Mortal Realm
while you still can.

71
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,280
If you keep going,

72
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,199
you won't just fail to save him.

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,080
You'll destroy yourself too.

74
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,719
Who are you?

75
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,599
You won't challenge my resolve.

76
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,319
I will cross this bridge.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
I will save Li Motong!

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,800
Have you forgotten
your sister's tragic death?

79
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,519
She died so horribly,

80
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
yet you're the one who lived.

81
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,680
Why was it you who survived,

82
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
and not her?

83
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,319
(Lu Huayan,)

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,480
(may you face your heart's trial)

85
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,079
(and cross the Nine Soul Bridge.)

86
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,879
Yan.

87
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,000
Yan.

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,519
Sister,

89
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,759
is it you?

90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,160
Yan,

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,360
ignore those treacherous voices.

92
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,480
I've met an unfortunate end,

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,079
but it wasn't by your hand.

94
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,720
You shouldn't blame yourself,

95
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,879
or drown in guilt because of me.

96
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,199
It was my fault.

97
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,920
It's my fault,

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Sister.

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,759
If I hadn't been weak and useless,

100
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,480
if I could've protected you,

101
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,120
you wouldn't have died.

102
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,920
It should've been me.

103
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,199
Not you.

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
Silly girl.

105
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,370
You already did everything you could

106
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,959
to protect me.

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,959
We grew up together.
We relied on each other for everything.

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,800
The joy,

109
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,879
companionship,

110
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,970
and protection you gave me

111
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,759
can't be measured in time.

112
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,519
The fact that you exist in this world,

113
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,319
that you became my sister,

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,079
is already the greatest gift
you could give me.

115
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,920
Sister,

116
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,879
do you really

117
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,920
mean it?

118
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,040
Yan,

119
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,279
I want you to live on.

120
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,160
If you want me to rest in peace,

121
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,399
promise me

122
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,480
you'll step out
of the shadows of the past.

123
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,040
Yan,

124
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,680
live on.

125
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,120
Sister,

126
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,959
I miss you…

127
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,000
Sister!

128
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,759
Sister!

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,279
Sister…

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Sister…

131
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,639
I will live.

132
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
I'll live well, for you.

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,279
I can do it.

134
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,920
(I can save you.)

135
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,560
Sister,

136
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,480
