2
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,970
=Episode 8=
(Battle Between Brothers)

3
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,039
You arrived faster than I expected.

4
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,679
Give Yan's soul and spirit back to me.

5
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,439
Come and get them then.

6
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Still obsessed with that woman?

7
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,239
Mei pearl isn't with you.

8
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,280
Your Wujian force is fading fast.

9
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,040
What do you have left to fight me?

10
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,599
If you love her,

11
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,840
death will be her destiny.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,000
Give them back.

13
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,799
Everything has a price.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,799
What will you trade?

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
What do you want?

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,239
A life for a life.

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
I want your life.

18
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,400
You lost your mind.

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,719
You'd give up your life

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,239
for that woman?

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,840
You can't die yet.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,280
If you die,

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
who will play with me?

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,079
Jing Haisi.

25
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,640
Human lives

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,120
is just a game to you.

27
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,599
After all these centuries,

28
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,879
you still haven't changed.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,039
The choice is mine.

30
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,599
You'll do whatever I say.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,210
Humiliating you is more satisfying

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
than killing you.

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,919
If you can't keep playing,

34
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,400
our meeting ends here.

35
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,680
What do you mean?

36
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,879
I want you to kneel.

37
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,319
Brother!

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,120
What spell

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
has that woman cast on you?

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,439
You've never knelt to me.

41
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,719
Now you kneel because of her?

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
How pathetic.

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,879
Wujian has no place for losers like you.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,319
I beg you.

45
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,479
Give them to me.

46
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,840
Don't ever bother me again

47
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,439
for that woman.

48
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,480
I can see again.

49
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,160
I...

50
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,120
Thank you.

51
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Mr. Li.

52
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,240
But

53
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,519
how did Jing Haisi give you
my soul and spirit so easily?

54
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,720
He didn't make it hard for you, did he?

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,639
Don't worry.

56
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,800
He's my brother after all.

57
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,560
Why would he make it hard for me?

58
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,519
Since your sight's back,
take your time to get used to it.

59
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,279
Li Motong.

60
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,519
Thank you.

61
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:58,839
Madam Zhang.

62
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,920
Have the clothes been washed?

63
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,560
I'll handle the housework from now on.

64
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,120
Why are you here?

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,680
I asked your housekeeper
to give me the key.

66
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,480
Speaking of,

67
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
I fired her for you.

68
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
You fired my housekeeper

69
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,160
without asking?

70
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,199
You said you'd protect me,

71
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,680
so I'm your personal assistant
from now on.

72
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Housework is my duty too.

73
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,519
Mr. Jing Haisi,
I can take good care of you.

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
I hate people who act without permission

75
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
and are noisy.

76
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,199
Mr. Jing Haisi, your shirt is wrinkled.

77
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,519
It must be uncomfortable.

78
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,399
Let me help you

79
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,879
wash it,

80
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,199
dry it,

81
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
air it out,

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,879
and iron it.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,199
It's silk.

84
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,519
It can't be ironed.

85
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,879
Get out.

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,360
Speaking of,

87
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,800
I still have dishes to wash.

88
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,920
You asked me to come here

89
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,680
all mysteriously.

90
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
What is it?

91
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,000
I have something for you.

92
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,480
I've seen this before.

93
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,120
The first time

94
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
was when you used it
to kill my sister's enemy.

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,480
This gun

96
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,519
is coated with black rose venom.

97
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
It kills only Wujian evildoers.

98
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,279
Now, it's yours.

99
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,120
You know how much
I hate the people of Wujian.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,319
And yet you give it to me.

101
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
Aren't you afraid
I'll use it against you?

102
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,080
As long as it keeps you safe,

103
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,519
I don't mind facing the consequences.

104
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,519
Boss.

105
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
This is a Wujian weapon.

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,399
You're giving it to Miss Lu.

107
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,279
What will you use to protect yourself?

108
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,360
Speaking of,

109
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,919
use mine.

110
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,559
Take it.

111
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,960
It'll protect you just as well.

112
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,590
Go check it out.

113
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,720
Alright.

114
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
You don't think anything's wrong, do you?

115
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,120
Don't worry. I'm here.

116
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,480
Boss.

117
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,120
Commander Jiang is here with his men.

118
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,519
Commander Jiang.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,320
What are you trying to do?

120
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,759
We've found new evidence
in the Paramount murder case.

121
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,840
Lu Huayan.

122
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,279
You must come with us.

123
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,360
My brother died unjustly.

124
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,279
I won't rest easy either.

125
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,799
Commander Jiang.

126
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,879
Look carefully.

127
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,600
This is my wife.

128
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,559
Take your men and leave.

129
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,000
In Ye City,

130
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,399
I'm the law.

131
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,559
Last time I spared you.

132
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,879
If you don't hand her over today,

133
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,679
I'll take lives.

134
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,320
My wife has nothing to do
with this case.

135
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,279
This is my territory.

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,120
Leave immediately.

137
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,320
Lan.

138
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,240
Huayan.

139
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,720
Don't worry about me.
Take care of yourself.

140
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,000
Did they hurt you?

141
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,159
Commander Jiang.

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,639
I already said I didn't kill anyone.

143
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,039
What can your so-called justice
really prove?

144
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,879
Even if I killed someone,

145
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,879
I'll take the blame myself.

146
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,639
What does arresting Lan accomplish?

147
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,120
I'll kill you now!

148
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,879
Boss, how could you kill someone?

149
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,200
(I can't believe)

150
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,679
