(You Are My Eyes)

3
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,679
I didn't expect the Lord of Wujian
to know me so little.

4
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,200
You're here.

5
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,280
I've never betrayed anyone's love,

6
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,679
nor fallen into another's arms.

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,679
He was the one who killed me,

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,560
yet somehow you all say I wronged him.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,439
You men are always like this,

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
calling women trouble.

11
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,840
I only asked for true love.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,000
What did I do wrong?

13
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,599
You tricked me.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,359
Hand over Yan's spirit and soul.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,359
That woman's spirit and soul

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,599
are no longer with me.

17
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,239
What do I have left to give you?

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,359
I'll give you one last chance.

19
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,439
Souls killed by Wanggui Sword

20
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,079
will never be reborn.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,319
Will you give it

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,840
or not?

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,799
She's pitiful too.

24
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,000
What I hate most is your so-called love.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,239
I'll make you newlyweds

26
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,920
lose your souls at your wedding!

27
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,840
Lord of Wujian.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
Come face your death!

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Boss, watch out!

30
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,760
Huayan.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Let me do it.

32
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,159
No!

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Where are Yan's eyes?

34
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,879
She'll never see again.

35
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,719
And you'll suffer all your life.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,039
How dare you act up
before the Lord of Wujian?

37
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,319
She'll never see again.

38
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,599
I don't know

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
whether to pity her

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,039
or to pity myself.

41
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,240
I wonder how much longer

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
I'll have to live in darkness.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,319
From this day on,

44
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,479
let me be your eyes.

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,719
I'll take you to see the world.

46
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,240
Mr. Li.

47
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,599
You're not

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,280
what I imagined.

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,360
You're not only thoughtful and gentle,

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,800
you even care about human lives.

51
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,039
Darling.

52
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll help you see Wujian

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
in a new light, little by little.

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,199
But my sister

55
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,680
did die at the hands of Wujian.

56
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,159
I couldn't save her.

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,759
But the soul-eating beast
that killed your sister

58
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,080
has already received its punishment.

59
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,840
You should move on.

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't stay trapped in the past.

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,639
You know what?

62
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,560
My sister and I relied on each other.

63
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,199
She raised me.

64
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,000
She's the one
I'm closest to in this world,

65
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,400
but she died tragically in front of me.

66
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,000
I could do nothing to stop it.

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,560
I can't live in peace after that.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
But dwelling on the past

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,199
won't change anything.

70
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,160
Letting go is not forgetting.

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,519
I believe

72
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,160
your sister would also not want

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,800
you to live with such painful memories.

74
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,160
Though my father came from Wujian,

75
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
my mother was actually human.

76
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,680
She's no longer around.

77
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,600
I miss her very much.

78
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,399
So I understand
your longing for your sister.

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Because longing deepens with time,

80
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,160
we should fight to live all the more.

81
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,959
I believe

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
this is what they would hope for us.

83
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,879
I will carry my sister's memory

84
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,759
and live well.

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,600
Mr. Li.

86
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,959
Thank you
for taking care of me these days.

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,040
I left something here.

88
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,759
Help me find Lan.

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,279
Alright.

90
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,959
I'll be right back.

91
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,360
Isn't this our famous Miss Lu?

92
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,399
What happened to you?

93
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,800
Is it karma for being evil

94
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,680
that you turned blind?

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,759
You're truly blind.

96
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,079
Miss Gu.

97
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,240
Are you bored?

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
Without my performance,

99
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,279
Paramount wouldn't even need you.

100
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,439
Even blindness can't shut your mouth.

101
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,959
From now on, Paramount's performances

102
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,040
will all be performed by me, Gu Meng.

103
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,759
What are you so smug about?

104
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,319
A pocket watch?

105
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,680
Give it back to me.

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,639
Everyone, come look!

107
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,279
Paramount's top star is blind.

108
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,639
Really?

109
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,959
Give it back.

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,360
Give it back!

111
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,240
Fine.

112
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,600
Come and take it.

113
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,160
Here it is.

114
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,560
Come on.

115
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,959
It's here. Hurry and grab it.

116
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,399
Or it'll be gone soon.

117
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,040
Over here.

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,240
Hurry.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,839
Can you see it?

120
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,639
Here.

121
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

122
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Trampling you underfoot

123
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,040
feels so good.

124
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,639
Miss Lu.

125
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,959
Give it back.

126
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,680
My big star.

127
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,240
Superstar.

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,560
Lu Huayan.

129
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
My watch.

130
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,199
Give the watch back.

131
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,800
A seductive ghost
doesn't deserve human skin.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,639
You can't act up here.

133
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,559
Look closely.

134
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,720
She's mine.

135
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,399
Get lost.

136
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:46,960
Here.

137
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,000
Yan.

138
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,320
Let me take you home first.

139
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,360
Here.

140
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,519
Here.

141
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,320
Give me your hand.

142
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,460
(The Next Day)

143
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,440
Look.

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,639
I can now

145
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,519
walk steadily on my own.

146
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,480
Watch where you're going.

147
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,720
It's alright.

148
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,879
Am I ridiculous?

149
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,679
I can't even walk properly.

150
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,120
It's fine.

151
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,279
I'll stay by your side.

152
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,840
It's alright.

153
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,519
Let me do it myself.

154
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,519
I can do it.

155
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Who's here?

156
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,879
It's Gu.

157
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,399
Do you two have something to discuss?

158
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,600
Go to work first.

159
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm fine.

160
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,679
I can walk by myself.

161
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,080
I'll walk by myself.

162
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,679
I found out.

163
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,720
Miss Xia works for your older brother.

164
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
Miss Lu's soul and spirit
are in his hands.

165
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,879
She's only blind for now.

166
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,720
If this drags on,

167
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,360
it could endanger her life.

168
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,120
It's him again.

169
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,550
The problem is Mei pearl isn't with you.

170
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,510
Your Wujian force is getting weaker.

171
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,600
You can't beat your domineering brother.

172
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,790
