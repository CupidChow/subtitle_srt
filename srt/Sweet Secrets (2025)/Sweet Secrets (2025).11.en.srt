(The Flame of Vengeance)

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,799
What's wrong?

4
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,000
You seem lost.

5
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,280
Seeing you so sad

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,479
really makes me happy.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,719
Why not tell me another thing

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,280
to cheer me up?

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,200
Why?

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,880
You're not interested
in your sister's matter?

11
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,280
What do you mean?

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,880
Both you and your sister

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,000
are hosts
of the Wujian Chi pearl and Mei pearl.

14
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,920
It's just that the same man
planted the pearl

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,480
on your sister and took it from her
hundreds of years ago.

16
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,760
And that was Li Motong!

17
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,799
And now you're with
the man who killed your sister.

18
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,879
How absurd.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,079
No way.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's absolutely impossible!

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,959
Believe it or not.

22
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,400
You will never get his love.

23
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,319
To him,

24
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,120
you're nothing but a plaything

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,159
that can be thrown away anytime.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,879
We separated them
in such an extreme way.

27
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,000
It was indeed despicable.

28
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,400
Despicable?

29
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,840
Don't forget

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
I was saving her.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,439
Li Motong can't live

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,000
without the Mei pearl.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,039
You're part of Wujian,

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,680
so you shouldn't be so indecisive.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,879
I can do anything

36
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,439
to achieve what I want.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,919
Li Motong!

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,159
Li Motong!

39
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,560
Yan, you...

40
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,919
I don't want to live in your shadow.

41
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,319
I don't want to be your replacement!

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
What are you doing?

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,960
I've never seen you as her substitute.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
From the very beginning,

45
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,360
you're the one I love.

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,000
My sister's death...

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
Does it have anything to do with you?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,879
My sister died

49
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,000
because she carried the Chi pearl.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,199
It was planted by you a century ago.

51
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,319
And you took it away after a century!

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,159
That's right.

53
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
The Chi pearl was indeed
planted by me a century ago.

54
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,080
So you've been lying to me all along.

55
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,680
You treated my sister's body as a vessel

56
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,000
just because you're the Lord of Wujian.

57
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,000
How cruel of you.

58
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,120
Yan.

59
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,919
Though I am the Lord of Wujian,

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,879
Wujian has its own rules.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,879
I had no choice.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,120
It's Wujian's rule to slaughter humans.

63
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,960
It's Wujian's rule to despise life.

64
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,919
It's Wujian's rule

65
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,520
to use human bodies as vessels

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,680
and trample them at will, huh?

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,199
The crimes you committed
are yours alone to bear.

68
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,680
I'll kill you!

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,599
Are you sure you want to kill me?

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,479
Li Motong.

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,319
You're a rogue

72
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,680
with blood all over your hands.

73
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,199
You're nothing but a demon!

74
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,840
Your sister's death

75
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,599
was the unbreakable rule of Wujian.

76
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,479
But if killing me

77
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,560
can untie the knot in your heart,

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,800
then pull the trigger.

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,519
Fine.

80
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,720
I'll grant your wish, then.

81
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,319
If killing me

82
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,759
can ease your hatred,

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
go ahead and kill me, then.

84
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,160
I'll spare your life.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,360
That way, you can keep
struggling in this world.

86
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,920
I want you to know
that living is worse than dying.

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,319
Between us lies a blood debt.

88
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,199

107

We can't be friends.

109

I just want you to live.

I'll remain blind.

119
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,519
It was destined
to be a mistake from the start.

120
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,399
From the very beginning, you shouldn't
have had to bear so much.
