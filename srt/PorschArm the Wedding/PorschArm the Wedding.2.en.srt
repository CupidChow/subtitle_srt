00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,160
(Reaction Guest) From those days we never felt like
we equally received what straight couples did...

2
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,760
Now, we see the equality,

3
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,800
not only the marriage
but all the relevant laws.

4
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,317
And we're humans under
legal protections and approvals.

5
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,640
We are equal now.

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,400
Well, it's been over 10 years
for the wait to be over.

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,885
And we're so glad this is happening.

[What is your thought on marriage equality
and rights in Thailand?]

9
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,066
Today's an accomplishment

10
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:34,720
that is also a huge celebration

11
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,720
with the execution
of the Marriage Equality Act.

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,640
Actually, for this law,

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,640
there shouldn't be marriage "equality"
in the first place.

14
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,280
There shouldn't be the term "equality" here.

15
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,366
This is the basic right every human deserves.

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Finally.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,640
We had fought for this for a long time

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,800
since 20-30 years ago.

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,120
Today, in Thailand, every love is approved
to be equally valuable.

[October 2nd, 2024
"100 days before the wedding"]

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,080
That's good, isn't it?

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,245
Where did you buy this?

23
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,120
- Umm, yes, it's great.
- Didn't you cook it yourself?

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,078
You did?

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,880
How was your Japan trip, Mom?

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
- Oh, that was incredibly fun.
- Okinawa?

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,360
Yes, it's close to the beach, right?

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm Potjanee Panatkool,

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,910
Arm's mother.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,760
Arm is a decent child. He's lovely.

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,718
And he's very polite and gentle.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,480
And his personality is bright and lively.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,684
Sometimes, he's moody
but also quickly gets over it.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,880
We'll go there after the wedding.

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,520
Oh, are you still planning for the wedding?

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,200
Yes.

37
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,920
- What about it?
- Of course, in the process.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,367
- Oh, how is it?
- It's...

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,480
It took them time to argue and stuff.

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,679
I was confused listening to that!

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,940
No idea where they want
to hold their wedding exactly.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,128
So, is the ceremony big or small?

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,920
Tell me about the details.

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,040
- It'll be in Bangkok.
- Oh.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,839
Our first plan was at the beach, but...

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,320
Our house is also in Bang Saen,
near the beach.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,320
But we thought it wouldn't be easy
for the guests to travel there.

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,903
So it'll be held in Bangkok.

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,240
- But just for 200-300 guests.
- Oh...

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,760
- No.
- What?

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,139
There are already many guests
from your side, right?

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,918
A hundred.

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,388
See? That's already half.

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
- And our friends, you know.
- Oh...

55
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,280
- Your friends and Dad's, as well.
- Right.

56
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,973
200 is an impossible number.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,280
- Ummm.
- I agree.

58
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,560
- It's possible.
- I don't think so.

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,480
We need at least 800 guests.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,200
- Oh!
- Whoa!

61
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,797
That's a huge one, sweetheart.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,396
- Really?
- We have lots of relatives and friends.

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,240
Yes, but my relatives aren't over 100 people.

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I don't have many friends.

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,200
How many? 99?

66
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,440
Around 100.

67
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,243
If we have 10,000 friends,
where should we hold it?

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,154
At Sanam Luang?

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,080
Their guests are over ten thousand.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,093
Why does the scale keep increasing?

71
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,400
- I think Arm had talked with two moms earlier.
- Of course.

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,800
- Lobbying!
- Yes.

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,375
This meeting was set up for this purpose.

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,760
This is acting, I'm telling you.

75
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,056
This is set up to lobby Porsch.

76
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,201
What would it be then?

77
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,451
- We're still talking it through.
- Don't argue.

78
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,120
Try to talk it through.

79
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,872
Alright? Don't think I'm lecturing you.

80
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,875
Look at me, I'm living alone...

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,498
and with you.

82
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:46,735
Alright?

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,880
We have talked about it as well.

84
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
- We don't always fight.
- I know.

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,980
Not a fight but arguments.

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,648
I'm telling you,
a couple's life isn't easy to keep.

87
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,458
It's difficult for every couple, no exception.

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
You stop, I talk.

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,039
I talk, you stop.

90
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,504
It goes with this pattern.

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,843
Small or big,
you need to discuss it with one another.

92
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:08,324
Challenge each other based on
what you're good at.

93
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
Find the balance for both,

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,894
then you'll find the forever love.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,080
Yeah? You know?

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,469
Advice from the expert?

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,806
Yes, of course! I have a lot of experience!

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,237
So much!

99
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:22,714
Like, this much!

100
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:25,215
Too much!

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,024
He is a stubborn person.

102
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,680
He's headstrong.

103
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,850
What I mean isn't that he's a bad kid,

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
he is a decent one.

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,615
A very decent one to me.

106
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,965
I only have him in my life.

107
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,922
Only Porsch.

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,017
He's my heart and soul.

109
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,090
I raised him all by myself.

110
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,020
I love him so much.

111
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,684
I told myself
he could grow up being whoever,

112
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,628
loving whoever.

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Just take them to see me.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,628
I always tell him
they can be a man or a woman.

115
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,093
Just take them to see me.

116
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,705
I'll appreciate them anyway.

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,110
My mom taught me

118
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,837
to see her as an example.

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,330
Well, a couple's life

120
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:15,912
requires compromise.

121
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:17,960
One pulls, the other has to follow,

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
and vice versa.

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
'Cause she...

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,422
Frankly speaking,
she wasn't successful with her love.

125
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,489
She didn't want me to
have that experience like her.

126
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,706
I don't know if that's true but...

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,880
a wedding can make a couple love
or fight each other to the core.

128
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,200
Now, it's leaning to the second one.

129
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
It's about to lean to the second one now.

130
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,213
I don't want it to...

131
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,121
Mom, you should wear something like this.

132
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,480
Let me see.

133
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
- Is this too revealing?
- Yes, it is, dear.

134
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,342
It is too short.

135
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,522
- What about this?
- Too flaring.

136
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,874
You got lots of options.

137
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,720
- Yeah?
- There are...

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,224
so many choices.

139
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,614
Yeah, yeah.

140
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,528
I think I will...

141
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,748
I've to stop shopping now.

142
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,070
Oh.

143
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,320
Good. Do it.

144
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,880
Helping each other out, right?

145
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:28,816
I heard you two talked about
the scale of the ceremony at the table.

146
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,096
What about it, dear?

147
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,360
- I don't know...
- Umm.

148
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,452
Well,

149
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,320
you can make it large, do it.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,613
You can arrange it
as enormous and grand as you want.

151
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,360
But... I need to say this, for the expense,

152
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,420
make it reasonable.

153
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,760
Money is still necessary.

154
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,040
You have to spend it wisely,

155
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,153
reasonably, you know?

156
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,551
Good, dear.

157
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Think about it carefully.

158
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,594
That's good.

159
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,040
I'll help you and do my best
to take care of you.

160
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,918
No worries, dear.

161
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,120
Spending reasonably for each person...

162
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:18,632
isn't the same, yeah?

163
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,039
Want some?

164
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,713
One sip.

165
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,732
Thank you!

166
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,690
Thanks.

167
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,138
Why did you sigh so loudly?

168
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,440
Spill the tea!

169
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,350
- Now...
- Alright.

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,087
We still can't decide on the guest number.

171
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,268
Porsch is fine with us marrying in Bangkok.

172
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,667
Aha.

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,360
But he wants only 2-3 hundred guests.

174
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,224
- Aha.
- That's not making sense?

175
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,880
You think that because

176
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,360
you're concerned that
the uninvited will feel bad or what?

177
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
Definitely!

178
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,760
To be honest, when you do the guest list...

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,940
- Have you done that?
- Not yet.

180
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,880
You can't decide the number
before making the list.

181
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,720
- Really?
- You...

182
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,280
For my wedding, I listed the names first.

183
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:26,440
And I thought mine wouldn't exceed

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,960
200-300 guests.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,920
- But it did.
- Oh, my!

186
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,760
It just exceeded.

187
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,840
It's not about me wanting a small wedding,

188
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
it's all about what the name list says.

189
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,200
Try doing this. Don't fight about this.

190
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,704
- Let the guest list speak for itself.
- I see.

191
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:45,640
- What about anything else?
- What if we don't have that for now...

192
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,280
- No venue?
- No card; the venue hasn't been confirmed.

193
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,520
- Right.
- Oh, my!

194
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,537
What else?

195
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,000
- I'm so confused.
- The garments? Done?

196
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,934
Not yet.

197
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,566
Not yet...

198
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,179
Umm, 3 months is kinda close, though.

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,663
What about the rings?

200
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:07,300
That will be ready on time, but

201
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,907
you have to have them, okay?
Don't skip them!

202
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,100
No, no, I won't.

203
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
The catering?

204
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,000
- No!
- For now,

205
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,485
I'm telling you
the food catering isn't a small deal.

206
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:24,609
It comes with everything.

207
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,909
Big or small,
this is an important factor, too.

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,930
Why are there so many things?

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
You're stressing me out.

210
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
I think you're too calm for this.

211
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,320
As I told you, the wedding
is not just a room-scaled event.

212
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
You have to plan ahead for hundreds of people.

213
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,320
And there are many details.

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,851
I'm stressed right now.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,637
Don't be. Just...

216
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,172
You have to make your move now.

217
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,140
- You need to do it now.
- I'm getting stressed.

218
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,158
I gotta go!

219
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,120
I interviewed couples
and asked if they could change one thing...

220
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,574
I also asked Dew, Arm's friend.

221
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,760
I asked,
"What would you change in your wedding?"

222
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,077
She answered, "I wouldn't get stressed.

223
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
I'd let myself go,

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,360
and feel the enjoyment
from the guest listing process onward."

225
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,600
The stress made her wedding not so good.

226
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,639
Every couple said something like this.

227
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,800
They said they wanted to handle it
with joy and without worry.

228
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,280
That changed the mood to be less serious.

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,117
I see.

232
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,522
Come here. Come here.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,268
I want to show you something.

234
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,587
What is it?

235
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,960
Ta-da!

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,526
Whoa!

237
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,200
- You like it?
- Let me see.

238
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,223
I met my friend the other day.

239
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,440
- Ah...
- I think it's pretty rushed now.

240
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,739
And we're too slow now!

241
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,878
So, I prepared this for you.

242
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,664
Oh, there are notes.

243
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,800
- And we can list what we want on it?
- Exactly!

244
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,440
- Let me get something.
- Huh?

245
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
- Wait a moment.
- What?

246
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
What is it?

247
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,160
I've done it too!

248
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,390
- Let me see.
- This.

249
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,813
- Let me see.
- No. 1...

250

Find the date. No. 2 is...

[Why didn't you tell your partner
about your wedding preparations?]

252
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,880
I prepared it
because I didn't want to miss anything.

253
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,011
And I thought Porsch didn't have that!

254
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,480
But turning out, both have made their versions,
which are great.

255
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,040
So we got to understand what to prepare.

256
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,107
Now, it's too delayed!

257
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,040
I didn't want to miss anything in my head.

258
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,520
I kept writing down when ideas came in.

259
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,880
So I jotted them in my notebook,

260
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,933
and it became a whole thing.

261
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,093
I think we have different thoughts,

262
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,620
but they will become mutual.

263
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm confident about it!

264
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,640
It's good that
you've prepared something similar to me.

265
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,389
This might make our convo easier.

266
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,334
- Oh?
- Okay.

267
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,820
We didn't request the auspicious date.

268
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,960
- We got the date.
- No monk suggestions.

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,056
Cross it.

270
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,003
We asked our moms?

271
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,040
- For the wedding date?
- No, we didn't.

272
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,195
We agreed to choose our special day.

273
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,292
And that is the date
I proposed to you 10 years ago.

274
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,361
- Right?
- So this has to be changed to "our anniversary."

275
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:49,397
Anniversary...

276
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,487
Oh, and it will be
the 11th anniversary by 2025.

00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,011
Okay, the date topic is done.

The budget...

279
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,666
- I just wrote it.
- We can estimate it once the theme is finalized.

280
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,308
The description has to come first.

281
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:07,080
And the guest number.

282
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
That will be around 200-250.

283
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,414
Hey.

284
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,763

the venue, clothes, and flowers.

Music band?

286
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,192
The cost for food catering is a priority.

287

- There it is!

288

There are lots of designers
and brands you can pick.

- We thought of wearing POEM for our wedding.
- Right.

- It's true.

The concept and the way of thinking
POEM has

346
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,040

I drew my inspiration
from the wedding garments

350
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,040
I would love to wear at my own wedding.

351
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,581
And as a single

of PorschArm since forever,

353
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,320
I have seen this couple for the longest time.

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,800
I grew up seeing diverse couples
like PorschArm,

355
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,280
who bring normality and
set up a new norm for society

356
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,720
for the love of diverse genders.

357
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,680
Around mid-year,
when the marriage equality law was approved,

358
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,971
I was waiting to see
if they would hold an official wedding

359
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,230
with legal registration.

360
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,960
- Oh!
- Stunning!

361
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,223
Are you gonna be the receptionists, too?

362
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,040
I'm Ging, Anne-Marie Pojananond,

363
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,800
a stylist.

364
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,160
I was there on the fitting day,
and the clothes impressed me.

365
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,440
I really want everyone to see them!

366
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm Pong, Arm's friend.

367
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,584
My status is single.

368
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
Actually, I like all of the clothes.

369
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,447
Every one of them looks stunning.

370
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:33,315
And the concept fits Porsch and Arm well.

371
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,360
But, personally,
if you ask which one I like the most,

372
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,280
I'll say the first.

373
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,633
The red one fits Arm so well.

374
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:44,140
And I hardly ever see him wearing red.

375
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,471
This is one, right?

376
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:49,080
And the last one was quite surprising,
the corset.

377
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,133
I'm looking forward to seeing
the corsets at the wedding as well.

378
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,080
- I like them a lot!
- All of them.

379
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
But I like...

380
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,800
- the ones that are...
- The second ones, right?

381
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,320
- high class with a big bow.
- True that!

382
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,400
- They're stunning.
- True. True.

383
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,600
- They're unique.
- Yeah, they stood out!

384
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,178
True.

385
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:09,644
They'll definitely stand out
against the backdrop.

386
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:12,320
- Right.
- Because they just pop up, like this!

387
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,960
Those were new to me.

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,833
- I've never seen them with wedding suits.
- Yes.

389
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,480
Especially on Porsch and Arm,

390
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,920
they're perfect!

391
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,394
They have a certain cuteness!

392
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,600
We went to POEM shop today...

393
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,478
So, we've already got this.

394
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Just like a dream!

395
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:39,174
- I know, right?
- Umm.

396
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:41,040
- I like it so much.
- Oh, my!

397
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,760
One is cleared out! Okay!

398
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,590
- Ceremony...
- And we got to have a reception.

399
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,928
Right?

400
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,680
Kiddy!

401
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,468
Come on.

402
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,951
Check. Check.

403
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,059
- Photographer.
- Yes.

404
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,568
We need that!

405
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,611
That one your friend suggested?
Choose that.

406
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,919
My friend said we need a main camera

407
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,319
and a candid camera.

408
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,227
Main and candid...

409
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,025
- Video too?
- Yes, right.

410
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,160
Use the service your friend suggested then.

411
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,698
That one for the main camera team.

412
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,753
Ummm...

413
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,737
Oh!

414
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,059
Speaking of the photographer,
is it the same team as

415
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,565
our pre-wedding team?

416
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:33,269
No, not the same one.
The team my friend suggested was...

417
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,222
I think I'm gonna go for the one
I found on Instagram.

418
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
I looked it up, and their work isn't bad.

419
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,960
- Plus...
- Expensive?

420
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,130
Good price.

421
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,573
- Alright?
- Yes.

422
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,880
So we're down with this team.

423
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,345
Good and cheap?

424
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,120
- Yep.
- Okay.

425
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
- Okay?
- Alright.

426
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,916
Will it all begin for real?

427
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,060
Yes, it will.

428
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:09,616
Are you hungry?

429
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,760
Let's have something to eat.

430
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,743
I'm excited.

431
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,610
Me too!

432
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,180
I hope the venue

433
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,760
is available on January 10th!

434
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,837
Hope they confirm.

435
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,934
I know, right?

436
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
Alright, let's go.

437
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,360
Keep it here. Let's add more later.

438
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,987
- Huh?
- Let's put it here.

439
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,705
- Sure.
- Or else, Kiddy might ruin it.

440
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
She will for sure.

441
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,808
Come on.

442
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,066
Ooh, that was so fun!

443
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,000
I was so happy planning it out.

444
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,596
Everything is going perfectly as we planned.

445
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,132
There was something
beyond my expectations as well.

446
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,210
For the venue,

447
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,042
we met halfway regarding our preferences.

448
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,712
I'm so delighted.

449
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,320
Seeing everything go as planned

450
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
makes me feel more relaxed.

451
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,108
And it's less stressful.

452
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:27,216
Well,

453
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,579
it's not like what everyone says:
that we would be stressed and stuff.

454
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,973
Nope, easy peasy.

455
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,720
Please wrap your arms around his body.
[October 26th, 2024 "76 days before the wedding"]

456
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,880
Move a little closer.

457
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,414
Okay, good!

458
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,347
3...2

459
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,360
3... 2!

460
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,170
Okay.

461
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,772
3... 2...

462
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,379
Make happy faces.

463
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,935
Okay, good!

464
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,795
Good.

465
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,473
Okay.

466
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,001
Great.

467
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,197
Need to change the posture?

468
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:14,430
Can you do the finger heart?

469
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,406
- Finger heart?
- Yes.

470
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,440
Finger heart again?

471
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
I don't like that!

472
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,840
- Just a little.
- Let's do something else.

473
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,520
It's an iconic pose.

474
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:25,316
It's also cute...

475
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,827
Okay!

476
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,175
Good!

477
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:32,464
Alright.

478
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,404
1... 2...

479
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,140
Just a sec.

480
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,430
It's blurry.

481
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,522
Okay.

482
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,037
1... 2...

483
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,682
Ah, good!

484
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,272
Hey, can I see it?

485
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,484
Sure.

486
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,112
The people behind us...

487
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,600
Will you remove them later or what?

488
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,640
I'll retouch them for you.

489
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,147
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Yes.

490
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,026
Oh...

491
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,080
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

492
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,633
Can we just move on to other poses?
No finger heart.

493
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,115
Umm, it's a cute posture so...

494
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:20,680
It's not like the reference we discussed.

495
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,285
The reference was to look like a real couple,

496
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,782
not a cutesy finger-heart couple.

497
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,739
- Just don't use that set of photos. It's okay.
- Right?

498
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:31,399
What should we do now?

499
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,520
Any other locations?

500
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,600
I'll go look for the next location.

501
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,200
So you won't need to remove people later.

502
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,800
- That might be better.
- I'd better find another location.

503
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,599
Alright.

504
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:47,351
Calm down, babe.

505
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,680
That was so frustrating.

506
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,618
I got you.

507
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,346
- It's not like the reference we discussed at all.
- Shh. Hold on...

508
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
I don't even care anymore.

509
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,341
- It's not like the reference at all.
- Shh...

510
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,650
- I don't care if they hear it.
- What did you send them?

511
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,502
We looked up the photo studio, remember?

512
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,400
But outside the studio,
the light and all are variable.

513
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,120
- But...
- I know, but natural light...

514
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,420
I like the green. I like it!

515
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,063
But it's not like this!

516
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,120
Have you seen the previews?

517
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,474
What the heck?

518
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,062
- Not like what we discussed at all!
- What do you want me to do?

519
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,320
We have to continue.

520
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,994
Arm, calm down.
Wait for the post-production, maybe?

521
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,233
He's already calm!

522
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,440
- He's so calm.
- He really is.

523
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,264
Oh, really?

524
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,844
- If I were there, I would be raging.
- Oh, really?

525
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:52,640
Seriously, just a park
with people is already a no-no.

526
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,861
- No...
- If I were him, I'd totally lose it.

527
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:57,080
If that was me in my 20s,
I'd be very angry.

528
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,310
- Right?
- I know, right?

529
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,904
I'm not cursing...

530
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,880
but it's not good, for real!

531
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,580
Such a waste of time!
Why did they even bring us here?

532
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,029
Yes, it is a waste of time.

533
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,482
The park! The location is great! I like it!

534
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,051
But the previews are not giving it.

535
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,351
What posture did he ask us to make?

536
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,926
The finger heart! Again and again!

537
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,520
It's okay.

538
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,436
I understand you.

539
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,760
But we can talk it through with them.

540
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,720
Don't try to argue with them.
Just hand them a new reference.

541
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,761
Do it over again.

542
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,142
What a boomer posture, the finger heart.

543
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,165
No, I can't keep doing this.

544
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,920
So we aren't gonna use it.

545
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,360
Saranghaeyo? No freaking way!!

546
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,572
We won't use those pictures.

547
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,045
Just let them keep taking,
but we choose what we want later.

548
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,752
Calm down, Arm.

549
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,074
I don't care now.

550
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,333
We're trying to support him,

551
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,815
but I saw them and I agreed

552
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
that the pictures sucked.

553
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,000
But we have to keep going, right?
We hired them.

554
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,176
I don't think we can tell them,
"Done. Over."

555
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,427
Look at the camera.

556
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,306
3... 2...

557
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,872
3... 2.

558
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,549
One more, please.

559
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,462
3... 2...

560
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,550
You wanna see the previews?

561
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,764
Let me see them.

562
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
I think they look good.

563
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,728
I'll retouch some parts of these later.

564
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,152
Alright.

565
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,440
How much time do we have left?

566
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,952
- How much time?
- Umm...

567
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:51,640
- Around 2 hours.
- 2?

568
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,865
Any other locations?

569
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,990
- There...
- I think that's enough.

570
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,211
It's fine.

571
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,100
I think that's enough.

572
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,060
Just that.

573
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,715
There is still some time left.

574
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,240
It's okay.

575
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,398
I think that's already enough.

576
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,920
- Right?
- As you said.

577
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,400
Yeah? So we can do something else.

578
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,571
- So they can go back and edit the photos.
- Alright.

579
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,680
Thank you.

580
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,560
- I'll send you the Drive.
- Yeah, do it.

581
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,920
Okay.

582
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,933
- How do you get home?
- Oh, I parked my car here.

583
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Please excuse us.

584
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

585
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,724
- Thank you.
- Thanks!

586
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,961
I couldn't do it anymore.
I just needed it to be over.

587
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,231
Stop it.

588
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Let's not film this.

589
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:28,680
Lots of things happened today.

590
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,257
Not only the photographer, though.

591
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,003
What do I have to do then?

592
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,040
You don't have to do anything.

593
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,802
Just try to control yourself a bit more.

594
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,465
I tried!

595
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,507
That's the best I could do.

596
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
You were cutting costs in the wrong place.

597
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,880
Hey...

598
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,598
- We could save cost with a small ceremony...
- How dare you say that?

599
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,320
Look at the guests and the scale.
You think we can handle that?

600
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,050
You, instead, were thrifty with something
you shouldn't be.

601
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,204
I don't understand why you brought this up!

602
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,240
I know! I know!

603
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,599
I know how I should spend!

604
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,314
It's not a big deal. I want to know if...

605
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,810
other photographers are 100K
more expensive than those or what?

606
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,453
So you had to choose them?

607
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,840
Can you stop it right now?

608
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,440
Photographer, guests, or whatever...

609
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,680
Can you please not bring this up right now?

610
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,865
And if you wanna talk about the guests,

611
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
let me put this straight,

612
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,445
I'll invite... to our wedding as well!

613
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,560
Oh, my God!

614
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,145
- Who?
- His ex!!

615
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,121
- His ex?
- Oops!

616
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:51,466
His ex...

617
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,240
Why did he bring this up now?

618
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,160
- Oh, Arm.
- Hell no!

619
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,760
- Saying it now is totally wrong!
- What the...

620
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,440
If it were your wedding,
would you invite your ex?

621
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,520
- No way!
- Right?

622
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,160
- Why?
- Because...

623
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,920
I used to have an open relationship.

624
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,125
And I was doomed.

625
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,360
- If it's mine, I wouldn't invite my ex either.
- Me neither.

626
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,440
Because I don't make friends with anyone
I broke up with.

627
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,320
- Okay.
- When I break up with someone,

628
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,480
we become total strangers.

629
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,880
- How should I put it?
- So, yeah.

630
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,080
- I'd feel bad for everyone.
- Yeah?

631
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,805
- Yes.
- We'd feel bad for everyone, right?

632
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:21,120
So we all won't open up the X files!

633
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,520
- Right!
- Ignore them.

634
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,080
- True.
- Otherwise, it'd be an ex-gathering ceremony!

635
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,040
True!

636
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,960
- It'd be no longer for us.
- All parties would be uncomfortable.

637
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,400
The guests would feel it too.

638
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,320
(Next Episode)
What's wrong with you?

639
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,520
Nothing.

640
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,884
What's wrong?

641
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,400
You've been looking down all day.
What's wrong?

642
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,919
I asked him, but he didn't answer.

643
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,640
So I didn't want to force an answer.

644
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,080
How would he react? Would he be happy?

645
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,840
[Dr. Suradej Panatkool
Birth: 17 SEP 1952; Death: 2 SEP 2021]

646
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:51,880
Alright.

647
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,360
Let's... exchange the rings.

648
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,686
The things we have to adjust, as Pol said...

649
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,440
Sometimes, misunderstandings happen.

650
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,277
We have to try finding the solutions.

651
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:10,900
Some can be adjustable.

652
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,839
Some reflect who we truly are.

653
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:18,560
But time and... our maturity...

654
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,920
will eventually make us accept and
understand one another.

655
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,144
Therefore, to every couple,

656
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,516
we can expect our partner to live happily,

657
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:35,991
but never expect them
to be like we want, all the time.
