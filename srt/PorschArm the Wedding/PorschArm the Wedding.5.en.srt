00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,560
[January 10th, 2025, the wedding day]

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,120
[The wedding day is almost here!
How are you feeling?]

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,560
I wasn't nervous at all,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,200
but at this moment, I extremely am.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,240
Today's finally come.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,880
After everything we've been through,

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,720
we're finally here.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
"PorschArm the Wedding"
(Episode 5)

9
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,400
Say hi...

10
00:02:54,055 --> 00:03:00,320
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers.

11
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Okay, getting through the first gate.

12
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,840
That was a piece of cake.

13
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:09,840
That was too easy.

14
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,560
I have to tell him
I love him in Russian?

15
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
"Tee-bya lyu-blyu."

16
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,760
Perfect!

17
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,870
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

18
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Here.

19
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,760
To return her kindness,

20
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
we need to give her 2 of them.

21
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,920
I can do anything for you.

22
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,720
- Arm!
- Yes?

23
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Listen up.

24
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
That's a yes.

25
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,320
Thank you.

26
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,840
I'd like to know

27
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,320
how Porsch told you he loved you
for the first time.

28
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,960
Do you remember that?

29
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,080
He said,

30
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,320
"I love you."

31
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,160
That's it?

32
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,280
What else did he say?

33
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,000
I love you.

34
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,080
You were saying?

35
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,080
We couldn't hear it.
Please say it again loudly.

36
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,160
I love you.

37
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,680
I love you, too.

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Here's our mission for you.

39
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,440
What is that?

40
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,560
Well, I have to eat this, right?

41
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,112
No.

42
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
Here's the other one.

43
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,600
- Please go a little bit to the back.
- Just a bit.

44
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,040
The number of money gifts
is written inside each envelope.

45
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,920
Pick the one you want.

46
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,200
It's all about luck.

47
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,560
Right here.

48
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,480
Open it.

49
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,280
- 2...
- Okay, 2 per person.

50
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,680
Thank you.

51
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:37,948
Arm!

52
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,072
I love you!

53
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,520
What did you say?

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,080
- Arm!
- Louder.

55
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
I love you!

56
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,600
I love you!

57
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,600
This is too easy.

58
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,440
Porsch sang a song for you.

59
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,640
Our mission for you is not that hard.

60
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,760
I'd like you to tell Porsch
without the mic...

61
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,840
Say it out so loudly
that everyone hears it.

62
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:20,552
That will be when you
complete our mission.

63
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,160
- Louder than Porsch did, too?
- Yes.

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,710
Say it louder than he just did.

65
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:26,720
- Tell him I love him?
- In 3 languages.

66
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,987
In 3 languages?

67
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,880
- That's hard.
- You said it would be easy.

68
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,160
3 languages.

69
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,775
The first one, go. Give me that mic.

70
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,320
Here you go.

71
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,560
I love you!

72
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,601
- Did you hear that?
- Did you hear him?

73
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,201
No, he didn't.

74
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,720
- That wasn't loud at all.
- Do it again loudly.

75
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,921
I love you!!

76
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,290
- You hear it now?
- I love you, too!

77
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,160
He heard that.
Now, the second language.

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
- Give me another language.
- Another one?

79
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,640
Wo ai ni!

80
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,481
Did you hear that?

81
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:03,920
- No.
- Say it again.

82
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,720
His hearing is poor.

83
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,920
Wo ai ni!!

84
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,120
Wo ye ai ni!

85
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,640
Alright, the last language.

86
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
Here you go.

87
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,652
Ya tee-bya lyu-blyu!

88
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Ya tee-bya lyu-blyu!

89
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Alright.

90
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,280
You've completed the mission.

91
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,200
He's passed all his missions.

92
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,880
[The guests' feelings]

93
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,320
Today's a good day

94
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,960
for the grooms to find lasting joy.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,360
As one of the guests,

96
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,480
I'm truly impressed and deeply touched.

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,640
I never expected to see the processions
from both grooms before,

98
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,960
having a different theme for each one.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Porsch's procession is a Chinese one,

100
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,880
while Arm's Thai.

101
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,760
I'm impressed by
how heartwarming their families are.

102
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,320
The genuine joy and laughter

103
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,240
shared by their families and friends

104
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
were also very touching.

105
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,240
To be honest,
this is absolutely dreamy.

106
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,680
It's like an ideal garden.

107
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,040
As soon as I saw this,
I knew it was Arm's idea.

108
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,280
This is so him.

109
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:58,840
And today,
when I saw the processions...

110
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:00,772
- Yeah.
- I've never seen something like that.

111
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:02,800
- Normally...
- Coming from both sides, right?

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,760
Normally,
the groom will go to the bride.

113
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,560
At first, I was like,

114
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,780
"Wait, both of them
have 3 missions to complete."

115
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,880
- "Oh, both of them have to complete them!"
- Things have changed.

116
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,721
- Exactly!
- You know?

117
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,730
- You know?
- And they...

118
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,800
came to each other on the podium.

119
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,800
- Right.
- I found that very sweet.

120
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,921
Yes, it was.

121
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,619
- And it was...
- Love was everywhere.

122
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:29,024
And we could feel...

123
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,480
the warmth of their families.

124
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,347
The grooms will now proceed
with their vows,

125
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:49,000
followed by the exchange of rings.

126
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Both are now ready.

127
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,880
Please welcome
Porsch Apiwat and Arm Sappanyoo.

128
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,764
Please give them a round of applause.

129
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:08,080
Let's welcome our grooms.

130
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,160
Beside him is his mom,

131
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
looking especially stunning today.

132
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,760
He, too, is looking flawless.

133
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,364
The flower boys and girls

134
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:25,840
are guiding them toward
their life together.

135
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,740
And yes, there must be Arm.

136
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,440
Please welcome Arm Sappanyoo.

137
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,919
Make some noise if you're his fan.

138
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,920
Walking down the aisle with his mom.

139
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,240
Let's welcome him again.

140
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
Please.

141
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,280
Leave your bouquet here.

142
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,680
Please join each other on the podium.

143
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
How sweet.

144
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
This is impressively
heartwarming to see.

145
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,000
Finally...

146
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,120
To my darling,

147
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,000
you look stunning today.

148
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,320
Over the past 17 years
we've spent together,

149
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,680
our journey has been filled
with both joy and sorrow.

150
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,320
You always compare our love to a drive:

151
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:52,240
smooth highways for our happy times,

152
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:59,911
and rough roads
where we navigate challenges together.

153
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,200
But through it all,
we've never turned back

154
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,760
or given up.

155
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,680
Instead, we've held on tighter

156
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,840
and kept moving forward.

157
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,880
Thank you for
sharing your life with me.

158
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,265
I'm glad

159
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,800
that you want to continue
this journey with me.

160
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,920
Thank you for wanting to
grow old together.

161
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,080
I also picture us finding happiness
even in our later years.

162
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,080
Thank you for enriching my life

163
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,840
and the lives of my family.

164
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:02,460
You've brought joy
to my parents and siblings.

165
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,212
To Mommy Lek,

166
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Porsch is truly fortunate

167
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,127
to have you as his mother.

168
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,640
You've raised him so well.

169
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,087
Today,

170
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,720
I'd like to be part of your family, too.

171
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,360
To Dad,

172
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,592
I'm sorry that
we couldn't make this moment happen

173
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,520
while you were here.

174
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,560
However,
I believe you are watching us,

175
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
witnessing this moment,

176
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,560
and sending your blessings.

177
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:11,228
I imagine you smiling
and celebrating with us today.

178
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,000
We've spent our lives together
for 17 years,

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,610
yet I still want to spend every second,

180
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,000
every minute, every hour,
and every day with you, Arm.

181
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,440
I want this moment to happen on repeat,
again and again.

182
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,600
I truly believe
this is not the first time we've met.

183
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,533
Everything's not our first time.

184
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,960
I could feel it in my heart

185
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,200
the first time we shared a hug.

186
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,920
We must have loved each other
in every rotating universe.

187
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,160
This is just another time
we get to love one another,

188
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,040
get married,

189
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,200
and spend our lives together.

190
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,202
The feeling of returning home
after a long absence,

191
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,720
breathing in the familiar air,

192
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,920
or sinking into our familiar bed...

193
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:34,160
That's the same feeling I had
when I first hugged you 17 years ago.

194
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,520
I believe our most beautiful picture

195
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,720
isn't today, in our formal suits,

196
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,944
or even on our wedding day.

197
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:54,728
It's the image of us
in our everyday clothes,

198
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,720
with fading eyesight and aging skin,

199
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,800
helping each other walk,

200
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,000
and reminding each other
to take our medicine.

201
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,440
It's the picture of two elderly men,

202
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,417
sharing a nightly
hug and whispering "I love you,"

203
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,527
just as we always have.

204
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:27,391
That, to me,
is the perfect image of our future.

205
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,840
I'd like to make this promise
in front of all our loved ones

206
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:40,232
that I'll cook for you
at night if you're hungry.

207
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,160
I promise to cover you with a blanket,
just as I always do.

208
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,240
Through good times and bad,

209
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,080
I promise to be here, caring for you,

210
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,668
and love you
until we reach that beautiful,

211
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:06,703
shared vision of our old age.

212
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,080
I promise.

213
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,541
These wedding rings,
symbols of their love,

214
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:27,560
will forever bind the grooms

215
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:35,520
and serve as a reminder
of the promises they've made.

216
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,679
Here are the rings.

217
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Please put the ring
on your groom's finger.

218
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,880
I am thrilled to declare that

219
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,520
the grooms are now officially married!

220
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,270
Please congratulate them again!

221
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,080
The processions were...

222
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,660
- so fun!
- So fun!!

223
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,800
All the friends' missions were like...

224
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,440
- They slayed that.
- Equal processions.

225
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,160
- Equality.
- Yeah, we had so much fun.

226
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,680
People were cheering for us
as if we were playing sports.

227
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,560
And the ring ceremony...

228
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Well...

229
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,240
- I cried so hard.
- It was touching and heartwarming.

230
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,120
How do I say this?

231
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,480
Love was everywhere.

232
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,720
You know, from us,
our families, and friends.

233
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,560
Love was really everywhere.

234
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,360
That moment taught me that love is love,
no matter how it manifests.

235
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,340
I'm overjoyed.

236
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,960
The place was filled with positivity.

237
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,920
And everyone said we made them cry.

238
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,381
I also cried so hard.

239
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,281
[What's there to see at the after-party?]

240
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,320
- You need to wait and see.
- Right.

241
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,880
Full of surprises and more surprises.

242
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,360
While I don't like receiving surprises,

243
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,979
- I can give them to others.
- So you're giving them surprises.

244
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,240
Very fantastic and magical.

245
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,960
Arm's favorite food...

246
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,960
is anything I cook for him.

247
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,440
I've said this countless times today,

248
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,640
but I'll just keep saying it.

249
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,240
I love you, Porsch.

250
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,080
I love you, too, Porsch...

251
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,200
I love you, Arm.

252
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,601
I was too nervous.
If you're ready,

253
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:03,760
please open the champagne
and fill the glasses.

254
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,945
Please.

255
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,520
[What do you want to say to yourselves
in the next 10 years?]

256
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,240
In the next 10 years,
we'll become older.

257
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,320
I want to tell Porsch
to care for his health

258
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,040
so that we can grow old
happily together.

259
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,960
Anything else?

260
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,520
I wanna say...

261
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,600
let's take care of each other
for as long as we can.

262
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,200
I don't know...

263
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,840
what the future holds,

264
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,480
but I hope we continue
caring for each other indefinitely.

265
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,000
I wanna say...

266
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Thank you for
spending your life with me.

267
00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:22,945
By then, we'll have been together
for 27 years,

268
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,800
and I want that

269
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,600
to continue indefinitely.

270
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,480
Let's grow old together.

271
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm very happy

272
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,680
that we met, found love,
and got to age side by side.

273
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Thank you.

274
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,202
[January 11th, 2025]

275
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,800
The guests said
this fish maw soup was amazing.

276
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,000
- It looks so good.
- I haven't had any.

277
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,640
Luckily, they kept it for us.

278
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,160
Let me try some.

279
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Looking nice.

280
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,600
- This is good.
- Let me try it.

281
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:08,171
- Mm!
- It's delicious.

282
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,320
Can I drink that?

283
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,040
Darling...

284
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,856
Yes?

285
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,908
Let's have kids.
