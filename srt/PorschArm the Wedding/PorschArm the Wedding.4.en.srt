[Anything special you want to do
before the wedding?]

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,400
I do have one.

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,240
I'll do what Arm hates the most!

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
[November 23rd, 2024
"48 Days Before the Wedding"]

6
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,680
These are horizontal and vertical cuts.

7
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,320
They are in different sizes.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,100
Try this on. I think it's cute.

9
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,520
Aww, this is cute.

10
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,480
- Right?
- It fits perfectly.

11
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,820
Put the ring on.

12
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,520
- I'm going to the toilet.
- Hold on. Don't leave now.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
Help me pick one.

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,760
Can I? There are a few diamonds on it.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,000
This is what you call 'a few, ' right?

16
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,560
- Just a few, right?
- You're right.

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,040
- The whole ring is still a few?
- Not that many diamonds.

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,260
- Just one, maybe.
- Really?

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
I wanna try that.

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,960
Is there a ring with just one big diamond?

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,160
Oh!

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,380
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,760
It's gotta fit me!

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
I gotta get this!

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,360
I think a wedding band is...

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,360
a symbol of a couple.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,640
Like, I got Arm here, and
Arm also got me there.

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,560
I'd touch it whenever I feel like it.

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,200
Personally, I feel like

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,420
the size of the diamond or the price
doesn’t define how much we love each other.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,000
The diamond doesn't need to be so large.

32
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,080
Or if it's small,
it doesn't mean our love is little.

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,280
It’s about whether it’s proper.

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,040
I think a ring has to be with us everywhere,
in every day, hour, minute,

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,880
just like the love I have for him.

36
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,560
Honestly, that ring

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,280
with those diamonds
emphasizes his love so much!

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,240
This is the abundance of love we have shared.

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,400
Gotta have some diamonds, you know?

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,560
Diamonds are our best friends!

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,680
Oh... This one is incredible!

42
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
This is the best one so far!

43
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,360
Hi there.

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay, alright.

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,040
Just like that, yeah.

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Just like that.

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,760
[November 30th
"41 Days Before the Wedding"]

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
- Yay.
- Push it in!

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,880
Push it in.

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,760
Yes. 1, 2, 3!

51
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,080
Give it to me.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,240
- Yeah.
- Put it in the envelope.

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,480
Just like this.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,320
- Like this.
- Why? Why do we have to put it in?

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,480
Put it in,

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,400
so it's ready to be given
to your mom and dad.

57
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,680
I met my friend yesterday.

58
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,520
Umm!

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,440
I was asked if we both would change
our surname.

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
Ooh!

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
What did you answer them?

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
I was thinking about it.

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,880
But what would it be?

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,640
- Like...
- Huh?

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,600
Should it be 'Sappanyoo, ' 'Apiwatsayree, '

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,480
- or 'Apiwatpanatkool'?
- 'Apiwatpanatkool'?

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,280
Because both of us can

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,360
change our surnames freely, right?

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,640
Right!

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,880
The law was approved, right?

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,130
So we can change or switch
our surnames as we wish.

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,640
What about ours? Will we change them?

73
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Or should we add the middle name instead?

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,880
Like...

75
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,920
Like, mine would be 'Sappanyoo...'

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,960
'Sappanyoo Panatkool Apiwatsayree.'

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,280
'Apiwat Panatkool Apiwatsayree, ' like this?

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,640
Or should it be 'Apiwat.

79
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Apiwatpanatkool?'

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,640
Just create a new surname, is that it?

81
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,160
I don't know.

82
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,340
Do you want to have a child?

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,590
Huh?

84
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,040
Yes, I do.

85
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
I don't know if...

86
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,800
we are ready for a child.

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,560
Imagine having a kid running around like this.

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
Come here!

89
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
That's cute, isn't it?

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,460
Yes, it is.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
- Yeah?
- But are we ready for that?

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Come here, boy!

93
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,400
Give me a hug!

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,040
Come here. Come on.

95
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
- Oh.
- Why aren't you obedient?

96
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,040
Give me a hug!

97
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,200
A turtle is coming!

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,360
A turtle is on your way!

99
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,890
- Look at the dolphin.
- What?

100
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,400
Is that a dolphin?

101
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,960
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

102
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,090
To have a child, we need to divide...

103
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,680
- not divide, we need to focus on them.
- You need to have a baby!

104
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,600
Huh?

105
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,880
- A baby?
- We need to, huh?

106
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,780
- Right?
- Yeah?

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,560
Really? Porsch and I have to have a baby?

108
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,920
Uncle Arm and I need to have a baby?

109
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,160
- Huh?
- Yes.

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,400
So, you'll have a friend to play with, right?

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,640
Yes, right?

112
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,200
- Yes.
- We gotta go to the post office.

113
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,120
- You just hit the bear?
- We can send out 100 invitations a day.

114
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
- At least.
- Yes, we gotta finish it.

115
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm playing with Sunny first.

116
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,120
See? One will have to work

117
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,680
while the other focuses on the child.

118
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,960
Or both have to focus on raising the child.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
And that will make us
less focus on each other?

120
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
No, that is not what it is.

121
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,120
- It's like we used to have 100% love.
- Don't overthink.

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,560
- And one day, our 100% is divided.
- Our love is still the same.

123
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,760
We have to give it all to our baby,
that's the right thing to do.

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,400
- Where are you going?
- So I want to know if we're ready.

125
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,240
Are you ready, Sunny?

126
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,080
- Do we want to have a child?
- We've discussed it a lot.

127
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,520
We wanted to have one,

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
but...

129
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,080
Yeah, we had talked it through.

130
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
I didn't want to have one.

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,760
We have to talk until it's clear.

132
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,390
We discussed the reasons on both sides.

133
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,480
It’s still up in the air.

134
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
I told him I didn't want one,

135
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,760
but I talked to my friend
the other day about it.

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
"Should I have a baby?"

137
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,360
So, we haven’t settled on anything yet.

138
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,560
But I just don't want any for now.

139
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,380
What we're facing is already tough
for both of us.

140
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,400
For the surname, it's not an LGBT thing,
it's universal.

141
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,040
- True.
- You can use his last name if you want to.

142
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,400
You can also keep your last name,
that's fine.

143
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,280
I think it's widely open now.

144
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
Even the name title, right?

145
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,640
- You can keep it or change it, for women.
- That's right!

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Yeah, you're right.

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,560
For the children topic,
it may not be completely legal.

148
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,880
You can have one,
but surrogacy is still not legal.

149
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,120
This topic could be discussed
for an entire episode.

150
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,320
In my opinion, I appreciate all couples
who try hard for babies.

151
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,240
You should have one only when both are ready.

152
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,000
I agree with you. For the surname change,

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,280
it's something that needs to be questioned

154
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,970
to find the best solutions

155
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,200
that meet individual expectations.

156
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,840
When my wife and I met and got married,

157
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,680
we were happy in our own way.

158
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,440
That fulfilled our lives in a certain way.

159
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,240
Having a child has taught me

160
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,300
to love someone in an indescribable way.

161
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,640
I never had that kind of love
for someone else before.

162
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,080
I love her...

163
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,280
- Unconditionally.
- Yes, unconditionally.

164
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,560
Just looking at her,
I can keep smiling the whole night long.

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,120
Just by looking at her falling asleep.

166
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
It's...

167
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,640
I think it's the happiness

168
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,600
that is so special.

169
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,160
I can't describe it to you,
you gotta discover that yourself.

170
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
- Umm.
- That's true.

171
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,680
We believe that, in an imperfect world,

172
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,800
there's constant beauty in our children
that shines on us every day.

173
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,440
Plus, I think...

174
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,840
My partner and I used to discuss

175
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,080
how gay couples have babies.

176
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,600
I never got a friend in my circle
who had experienced that.

177
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,480
I just felt like...

178
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,560
Many men and women get married
and fail in their relationships.

179
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,360
Some families have only single moms
or single dads.

180
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,040
I grew up in a family
where my parent separated as well.

181
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,210
However, with love,

182
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,360
kids can be raised by anyone!

183
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,880
- It doesn't matter.
- Just ensure they're loved.

184
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
They will grow up being a happy,
content person.

185
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,920
I can tell you, I also have a kid.

186
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,840
We've never known what this feeling is like
until we experience it firsthand.

187
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,960
[Anything special you want to do
before the wedding?]

188
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,620
No, nothing special.

189
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,480
We've done everything already!

190
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,120
We've prepared everything.

191
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
No stress!

192
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Fresh!

193
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,040
Oh, good job. Correct!

194
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,840
- Who's that?
- Huh?

195
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,760
Nothing.

196
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
- This.
- What is that?

197
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
What is this?

198
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,790
Yes.

199
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,940
Okay, confirm.

200
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,160
Right, as the time I reserved.

201
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,560
That's right.

202
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,080
About the details...

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Ah.

204
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,360
Okay. That's great!

[December 1st, 2024
"40 Days Before the Wedding"]

206
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,160
Shall we go out for dinner?

207
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm feeling tired.

208
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,560
Just order delivery.

209
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,850
I'm bored of it.

210
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,720
I can't think of any I want to have.

211
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
What do you want to eat?

212
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Outside.

213
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,720
I know, I mean, what are we eating outside?

214
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,920
Just look it up later.

215
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,440
Jeez.

216
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,720
Just drive out
and look for a restaurant later?

217
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah.

218
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,000
Is that a joke?
No way, I'm too tired for that.

219
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,160
- Let's go out and have our dinner.
- No way, I'm tired!

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,720
Why not?

221
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,280
Let me ask you
what you want to eat if we're out?

222
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,280
- There are various options available.
- What are they?

223
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,280
Japanese, Mexican, Chinese, or Thai cuisine.

224
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Umm!

225
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Lots of options out there.

226
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,600
- For all these...
- And Italian cuisine, too.

227
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,520
We can order them home!

228
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
That's suspicious.

229
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,430
It felt like he was hiding something,
I don't know.

230
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Suspicious!

231
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
Where are you taking me to?

232
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
- Are you excited for that?
- Huh?

233
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Sure I am!

234
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,080
Why so?

235
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,000
You rarely drive for me!

236
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,000
Where are we going?

237
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,840
Isn't it great?

238
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,880
It's great...

239
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,760
- But...
- Isn't it great having me as a driver?

240
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
You’re acting suspicious.

241
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,160
What?

242
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,480
Seeing a newbie driver...

243
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,560
No, tell me where we're heading to.
I can drive it for you.

244
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,120
- Huh?
- What about that?

245
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,280
If I tell you, it's no longer a surprise.

246
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
Keep your eyes on the road, not me.

247
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,240
- Huh? Come again.
- Eyes on the road!

248
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,320
Where are we going?

249
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,520
This area...

250
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
Surprise!

This place?

252
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,830
Yeah.

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,280
Whoa!

254
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Good evening, sir.

- Hi.

Whoa...

Thank you.

Whoa...

Thank you.

Whoa!

262

- Were you surprised?
- What's with all this?

263
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,880
Were you?

264
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,640
I haven’t had dinner like this in ages.

265
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,560
- It's dinner before the wedding.
- What's this?

266
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Aw!

267
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,080
What is that?

268

Hey...

271
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
- Is this even real?
- I know...

272
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
you don't like receiving flowers.

273
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,440
But I gotta give you this...

274
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,890
How many have you received
from dating me?

275
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,640
Remember?

276
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
This is the second.

277
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
- This is the second flower in 16 years, right?
- Yes.

278
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
- A flower before the wedding.
- I'm gonna cry.

279
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,520
Thank you, babe.

280
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,600
Thank you so much.

281
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,560
Thanks.

282
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,520
- Thank you.
- I love you.

283
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
I love you too, monkey-pie.

284
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
I'm so glad.

285
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,260
We're about to get married.

286
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,920
Let me sit and think about this.

287
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Is it good?

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,080
Thank you.

289
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,990
- That's the Christmas tree.
- Oh, you're right.

290
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,200
Delicious, isn't it?

291
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I'm extremely happy.

292
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,640
Thank you, babe.

293
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,120
What now?

294
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,920
- That's not it.
- What?

295
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,840
- The surprise is not done.
- What is that?

296
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,760
Huh?

297
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,920
Only a double surprise is a real surprise.

298
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,200
That's insane!
I don't want more of this.

299
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
What is that?

300
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,640
What?

301
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,080
Just kidding.

302
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,840
Come on.

303
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,800
What now?

304
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,120
No, no way!

305
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,320
Come on!

306
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,480
Please.

307
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,080
I know you're not into surprises.

308
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,880
We're getting married soon.
You need to agree with this.

309
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,680
- I'll put it on myself.
- Smile first!

310
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
I'll close my eyes myself.

311
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,400
Smile first.

312
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,920
Don't peek, okay?

313
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,400
Alright.

314
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
How many fingers am I holding up?

315
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,800
8.

316
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
What about these?

317
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,520
Huh?

318
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,000
- How many?
- 1.

319
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,840
What the heck is that?

320
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
What?

321
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,560
Our journey starts now!

322
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,840
- Where are we going?
- Don't peek. Promise me first.

323
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,120
Promise me.

324
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,920
Give me your hand, that hand!

325
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,000
This. Don't touch.

326
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,440
Don't touch, okay?

327
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm stressed out!

328
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,760
Monkey-pie!

329
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,080
- Huh?
- Are we there?

330
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,880
Don't open the blindfold! Don't do it!

331
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
What the heck?

332
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,640
- Don't.
- No, I don't like this!

333
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,600
Don't peek.

334
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,800
- Don't open it. Don't.
- I don't like it now.

335
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,670
Don't do it, okay?

336
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,640
What the heck?!

337
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,950
- I don't like this.
- Hold my hand.

338
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,160
Why is your hand this cold?

339
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,520
Why is it so cold?

340
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,040
I just don't like this!

341
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,290
What is it?

342
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,800
I'm so excited, my heart is beating fast.

343
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
What is all this?

344
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,550
Huh?

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,960
I don't like doing this now.

346
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,440
Don't be upset. It's nothing!

347
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,080
Why are you crying?

348
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Don't cry.

349
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,280
Why so? Don't cry!

350
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,360
Hello!

351
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,520
- Hello.
- Can I take this off?

352
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,160
- Hello.
- Hello!

353
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,320
What is that?

354
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,240
Don't you recall any voices?

355
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,010
He's about to cry.

356
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,960
- He is.
- Go comfort him.

357
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,110
Hold on.

358
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
- Don't you take that off!
- Don't!

359
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,700
- Don't you...
- What the heck is this?

360
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,540
Come on.

361
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,860
Is your stuff here?

362
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,240
- Is it?
- Is it??

363
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,680
- All you have is here, right?
- Right?

364
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,960
- Bye-bye!
- Thank you!

365
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,680
- Bye-bye!
- Thanks!

366
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,920
Walk up. Keep walking!

367
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
- You know it's me?
- Keep walking.

368
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,160
You know?

369
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm scared.

370
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Nothing scary!

371
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
Everything's so scary, actually.

372
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,660
- Everything's mysterious and horrifying.
- I don't wanna do this.

373
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,640
I don't wanna do this.

374
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,600
Everything looks scary for real.

375
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,520
1, 2, 3!

376
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,380
Surprise!

377
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm crying.

378
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,520
Give him a welcome drink.

379
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,040
Here are the welcome drinks!

380
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,960
How are you feeling now?

381
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,760
Pick one.

382
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
Don't use your hands!

383
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,560
What about this?

384
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,920
Look this way!

385
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,380
That's too low.

386
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,520
- Yay!
- Yas!

387
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,400
Bottoms up!

388
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
It's edible.

389
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,960
This is yummy!

390
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,480
- Hen Night.
- It's of course yummy!

391
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,280
Our bride is drop-dead gorgeous!

392
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,440
Hope we see him like this tonight!

393
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,360
Yay, like this!

394
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,000
Men... Oh!

395
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,320
Whoa!

396
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,080
Yay!

397
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,160
Yay!

398
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Porsch's side.

399
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,520
- He must be praying.
- Praying at home.

400
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,490
Praying?

401
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,960
I told you!

402
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
He actually did it!

403
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,320
I told you!

404
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,880
- He sleeps at 8 P.M.
- Oh!

405
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,400
So lovely of him.

406
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,890
- Pity him.
- Did he set an alarm to pick up Arm?

407
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,720
- Aw!
- Aw!

408
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,960
- Wow!
- Whoa!

409
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,880
How was your night?

410
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,960
- What was all that?
- Tell me.

411
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,050
What was that? Hmm?

412
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
Did you have fun?

413
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,930
- What was that?
- Did you have fun?

414
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,880
It's like, what the heck, though!

415
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,400
I had planned it all ahead of time.

416
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,950
Was it fun?

417
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,360
It was!

418
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,600
But I told you I didn't like a surprise!

419
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,010
I was crying!

420
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,040
Thank you so much.

421
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Don't thank me. Thank your friends.

422
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,200
I just...

423
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,040
What is it?

424
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,400
I was just a decoy.

425
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,040
Tell me what happened there.

426
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,200
It was extremely insane!

427
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,840
- It was totally insane.
- Tell me, I wanna know.

428
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
Your friends said there would be a dance...

429
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,680
A go-go dance, like wow, right?

430
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,120
- Yes.
- I want to see that.

431
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,840
There was a dance. I was sitting in a chair,
then they lifted me!

432
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,800
- Yeah.
- And you were like, this?

433
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,640
No, I was like, "What is this?!"

434
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,160
- I was so hilarious.
- What else?

435
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,600
Let me hug.

436
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,240
I love you, babe.

437
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,360
- I love you too, monkey-pie.
- Everyone loves you.

438
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Did you cry?

439
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,360
Oh, I don't believe that.

440
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
- I cried so hard.
- Really?

441
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,200
- I cried a lot.
- I thought you were just teary.

442
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
I cried like...

443
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
I cried from the time I was in the car.

444
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,920
It's what a surprise is supposed to be.

445
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,280
Are you hungry?

446
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
- Wanna eat?
- Yes, I'm hungry.

447
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,600
What do we have?

448
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,330
- A fried egg?
- Sure, go ahead.

449
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,800
I'll do that for you.

450
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,440
Go take a shower first.

451
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,760
Come on!

452
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,120
I'm going.

453
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,440
I will take a shower!

454
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,320
A fried egg is served.

455
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Hey.

456
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,640
A fried egg is served!

457
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,960
Come on.

458
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,040
Whoa!

459
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,800
Crispy edges, soft whites,

460
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,200
and a runny egg yolk!

461
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Am I correct?

462
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,160
No one knows me like you do!

463
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,080
But the yolk is ruined.

464
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,560
It's all fine!

465
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,760
No worries, it's still delicious!

466
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,000
I want to keep frying your eggs.

467
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,360
I wanna keep eating it, too.

468
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,400
Your fried egg is the best in the world!

469
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,040
The fried egg eater is also the cutest!

470
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,200
I love you, monkey-pie.

471
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,000
I love you, too, babe.

472
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
(Next Episode)

473
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,920
Who do you love?

474
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,680
I love everything around me.

475
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,280
My family and myself.

476
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,360
Friends who have been through
thick and thin with me.

477
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,320
Long distance doesn't do anything.

478
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,420
Since I was 11 years old, let's say.

479
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,240
Sometimes, by looking in their eyes,
I knew what they were thinking.

480
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,000
Maybe, over 40 years.

481
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,320
Anything that makes me happy is called love.

482
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,980
Since I was a teenager.

483
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,160
In the future, we may be
in a nursing home together when we're 70-80.

484
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,640
Now, I have some love

485
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,600
for my family, my mom and dad.

486
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,120
It's been almost half a decade.

487
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,680
Love, for me, is for two people
that have feelings for each other.

488
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,200
I wanna say I love all my friends.

489
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,560
Whenever I want to improve
their surroundings

490
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,560
whether it's humans, animals, or objects,

491
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,200
it's a kind of love

492
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,680
that's worth living for as a human being.
