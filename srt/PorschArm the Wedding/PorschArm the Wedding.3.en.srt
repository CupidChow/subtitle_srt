(Reaction Guest)
The car scene at the end

3
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:03,000
- was somewhat awkward.
- Right.

4
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,800
- And what are they both gonna do?
- What are they gonna do?

5
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,600
- Yes.
- Is one of them gonna bring his ex?

6
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,474
Ooh!

7
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:12,200
How was that brought up?

8
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,440
- How!?
- It came out of nowhere.

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,640
- Yeah, right.
- Mm.

[October 30th, 2024
"72 Days Before the Wedding"]

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,400
Babe...

12
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
Did you check the card I sent to you?

13
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,240
Yes, I did.

14
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,480
What do you think? You like it?

15
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,200
Good.

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Any adjustments?

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,560
It's beautiful; no adjustment is needed.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,800
Really? Are you sure?

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
It's already great.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What's wrong with you?

21
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,960
Seriously, what's wrong?

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,960
No, nothing.

23
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,400
Are you going out?

24
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Mm, yes.

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,755
If you want to have dinner at home, tell me.
I'll make some for you.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,560
He's acting strange, like...

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,720
He's oddly different.

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
Like, he's mad at me?

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Or what?

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,800
I already asked him, but he didn't answer.

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,560
I didn't want to force an answer.

32
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,600
In my opinion, before the wedding,

33
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,880
there are challenges occur for all parties
regarding pressure.

34
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Some couples even go through
a state of hesitation

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,800
- like, "Should we cancel the wedding?"
- Mm!

36
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,360
Hopefully, that situation doesn't happen
with this couple.

37
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,880
We got that day as well.

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,200
That day, I asked you,
"Why did we still want to get married?"

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,760
- Why so? There are plenty of things ahead of us.
- Right.

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
We started to sit back and question things.

41
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,560
In the end, fear teaches us lessons.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,960
I think there's a horrible side

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,720
that makes us reflect on what we're doing.

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,840
You mean, hesitation?

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,000
- Like, we're about to kiss...
- Tuning in.

46
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,720
We're about to bond as one, right?

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,040
But, at that moment, when a conflict occurs,
I start to think twice

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,400
if I still want to marry the person
who has a different opinion.

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,840
Like, "Am I gonna marry someone
I can't truly communicate with?"

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,120
Those unforeseen questions will pop up.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,400
- Mm.
- This is quite...

52
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,120
emotionally trembling.

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,440
And as the audience,

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,500
we want to know
how this couple's gonna deal with it.

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,640
Like, yeah. How?

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Hey, monkey-pie!

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
Why didn't you sleep?

58
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Why?

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,001
I'm not sleepy.

60
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
No way, it's already late.

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm not that sleepy.

62
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,280
What's wrong?

63
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm fine.

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,400
You look so down the whole day.
What happens?

65
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Nothing.

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Are you sure?

67
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,720
Then go to sleep!

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,500
Let me check this out first.

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,840
No, sleep.

70
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,800
Now. Sleep now.

71
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm going to take a shower,
and will get in bed with you.

72
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,080
Turn off your phone and sleep.

73
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,320
- Arm.
- Huh?

74
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,720
Yes.

75
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

76
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,920
Hmm? What is it?

77
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,080
Hmm? What?

78
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,600
What is it?

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
What's wrong?

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
What happened?

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Hmm? What happened?

82
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,320
On the day we did the guest list together,

83
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,960
my mom also sent me her list.

84
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
And I started thinking...

85
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,760
if your dad were still alive,
his friends would come too.

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,040
So I wanted...

87
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,000
your father to join us too.

88
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I had talked to him before proposing to you.

89
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,840
He told me to do it.

90
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,200
He supported my decision, you know.

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,800
So I think if he can witness us too,

92
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,120
that must make him happy.

93
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,960
Umm, true.

94
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,920
That's right.

95
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,280
I just feel like...

96
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,010
I wonder if...

97
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,080
if my father knew about all this,

98
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,800
what would he feel?

99
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,960
Would he be delighted?

100
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,809
What would he think about this?

101
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,938
I...

102
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,360
He didn't even know who I am.

103
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,840
He didn't even know who I love.

104
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,680
I don't know... It's...

105
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,463
It's like...

106
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
It's frustrating me.

107
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,440
Why did you just tell me?

108
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,680
Why?

109
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,315
I don't even know...

110
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
if he would be proud
to see me starting a family.

111
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,960
He must be so proud of you.

112
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,800
He would be, that's for sure.

113
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,360
It's frustrating me...

114
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,172
so much.

115
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I want...

116
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,141
I want to tell him about us.

117
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,120
I want to tell him.

118
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,539
Sure.

119
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,640
That's good.

120
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,280
I want him to know who I love.

121
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,200
I want him to know who I am.
I want...

122
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,720
I wanna pay respect to your dad too.

123
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Shall we?

124
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,360
I was not close to him,

125
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
because...

126
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,200
my mom and my dad divorced

127
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
when I was very young.

128
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,360
Though we were not close,
I still loved him.

129
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
But our relationship was,

130
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,400
you know,

131
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,000
like a dad and a son

132
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
who only saw each other on weekends.

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
I...

134
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,200
I had lived with my mom

135
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,040
until my dad passed away

136
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,120
10 years ago.

137
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I never told him

138
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
who I've loved.

139
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,280
So...

140
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
It's like...

141
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,400
It's something that got stuck in my mind.

142
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,400
There's always this question inside:

143
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,240
"If I told him who I loved...

144
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,160
If I told him who I wanted to
start my family with,

145
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,560
would I disappoint him?"

146
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,040
"Or would he still have been proud of me?"

147
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,400
"Or would he have felt nothing?"

148
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
I just want to tell him.

149
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,080
Actually, for me,

150
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,920
you can say that
I don't know Porsch's dad at all.

151
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,080
I spent the most time with him

152
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,280
at his funeral.

153
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,720
We didn't get to talk.

154
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,005
I know Porsch loves his dad so much,

155
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,480
but he didn't get a chance to tell him that.

156
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,559
I think this is a good breakthrough.

157
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,160
I'll take this opportunity

158
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,680
to tell him

159
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,400
that he can be worry-free,

160
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,080
and I will take care of Porsch for him.

161
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,600
[Arm, will you also visit your dad?]

162
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,480
That's right.

163
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,480
Well, I'll also go see my dad.

164
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,800
I'll go and pay respect to him too.

165
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,200
Actually,

166
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,280
after his death,

167
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
I frequently visit his tomb

168
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,520
and pay respect to him.

169
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,400
Anyway, I still miss him.

170
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,065
- Oh..
- Umm.

171
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,194
I've been a friend with Porsch for years,

172
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:49,480
but I've never heard him open up about
his deepest thoughts on his family like this.

173
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,200
- I got goosebumps.
- Right.

174
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
- That gave me chills.
- Me too.

175
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,160
- We got goosebumps.
- Yeah, two of us.

176
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,080
I think they got sorrow, sadness,

177
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,200
and curiosity, all mixed together.

178
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
He has something
he wants to know but never will.

179
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah.

180
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,480
- Something untold.
- He hasn't said it all out.

181
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,680
I want to tell Porsch and Arm something.

182
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,520
Shout out to them.

183
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,520
One thing humans suffer the most is
to have unanswered questions.

184
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,200
Sometimes, the best answer is
the present happiness.

185
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,280
Presence matters the most.

186
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,793
Though we will never get to know
if your dad's proud of you,

187
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:32,760
I believe our proudest moment is
to be alive and feel loved.

188
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
I used to be a human that never felt the love.

189
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,840
And it was frozen inside.

190
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,760
But today,

191
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,560
I feel like being born and feeling loved
is already completing a human's mission.

192
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
That's it.

193
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,440
My oldest daughter is six years old.

194
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,113
She starts to observe.

195
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:53,740
I try to get her to understand that

196
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,840
people have different kinds of love.

197
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,080
I let her see the diversity,

198
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
not only the binary.

199
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,000
I explain to her that,
"Two love each other, so they live together."

200
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,000
Something like that.
That's the way I explain her.

201
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
Like, your kid.

202
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,680
Your kid grows up in an LGBT community.

203

- Yes.
- Me, one of them.

204
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,815
Umm, so...

205
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,720
my kid is still too young

206
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,720
to process or even question,

207
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,473
like, "Why is this? Why is that?"

208
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,680
I start it all with not limiting

209
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,040
my daughter to enjoy a race car

210
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,220
or saying a boy
can't play with a Barbie doll.

211
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,593
Play whatever you want.

212
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,880
Toys are unisex for my kid.

213
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,160
Sometimes, some daughters are afraid

214
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,673
to let their moms know they like girls.

215
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:44,760
And those moms told me,

216
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,273
they told their daughters that
they thought women were beautiful too,

217
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,605
their kids could explore themselves

218
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:54,280
if you just admire them or like them.

219
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,820
Or you can seek consultation if you want to.

220
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,833
Slowly teach them and shape them.

221
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,720
Everything is beautiful to her.

222
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,513
- Slowly adjust and educate.
- That's good.

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,040
We can really talk about anything!

367
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,520
- It can literally be anything.
- Mm!

368
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,280
Sometimes, her perspective
and mine ain't align.

369
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,960
The way of living in my generation
and hers are different.

370
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,680
I also learn some new perspectives
from her as well.
