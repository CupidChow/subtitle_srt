We've spent our lives
together for 17 years,

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,280
yet I still want to spend every second,

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,660
every minute,

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,280
every hour,

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,750
and every day with you, Arm.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,040
I want this moment to happen on repeat,

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,780
again and again.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,180
I truly believe this is not
the first time we met.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,720
We must have loved each other
in every rotating universe.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,880
This is just another time
we get to love one another,

Oh my!

Arm, come on.

Just breathe,
or else the pic won't look good.

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right.

Come again. What was your question?

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,560
Say it loudly.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,370
Will you marry me?

- Hi!

- Let's go.
- I miss you so much.

Not at all.

Where should we go?

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,690
Wanna eat something?

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,430
Let's have it at home, shall we?

Baby, I want this.

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,250
- So sweet.
- I want to be kissed when I get into the car.

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,760
It's been over 10 years,
yet they're still romantic.

45

Porsch!

46
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,920
What?

47
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,240
I think we should save
January 10th for our day?

48
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,640
January 10th?

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,260
Yeah, I'm in.

50
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,340
So it's gonna be the same day
with the proposal.

51
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,170
So...

52
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,680
that means we won't
wait for the royal gazette

53
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
if we take that date.

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,200
Or we post the 10th as our marriage day...

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well...

56
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
What day is it today?

57
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,920
September 10th.

58
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,080
- September 10th, huh?
- September 10th.

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,840
September, October, November,
December, January...

60
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,750
- That's it!
- Exactly 4 months.

61
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,430
- 4 months, 120 days!
- 120 days.

62
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,820
If the royal gazette announces
the equal marriage today,

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,080
- that is it.
- So we can register ours on the 10th.

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,240
Exactly! We can register our marriage

65
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,550
and get married on the same day! Perfect!

66
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,960
What time is it now? Hello?

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,200
- What do you mean?
- They won't announce it this late.

68
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,300
They won't. Look at the time.

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,950
What should we do then?

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Do you mind if our marriage
and registration aren't on the same day?

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,530
What if we get married first and do
the registration when it's available?

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
I don't mind that.

73
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,080
Honestly,

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,020
we've been waiting for over a decade now.

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,600
A few more days won't change much.

76
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,040

Just a few more days,
it's gonna be just fine.

To the light?

82
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,310
- That's right.
- And the light would go out.

You might recall a video of a man proposing
to another man 10 years ago.

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,130
You might have thought
it was part of a series or an act.

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
But the man in that video was me.

100
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,440
It's me.

and we're finally getting married.

I am cooking.

105

- Breakfast.
- Ooh!

I want a fried egg with a runny yolk
and crispy whites.

107

Fried egg...

- Here you are.
- Oh, wow.

109
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,890
This looks absolutely scrumptious.

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,660
For our wedding,

111
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,440
we should do it by the beach.

113
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,570
- Beach?
- It must be so good.

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,880
What about our guests?

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,790
- Then we can only have a few guests.
- Our guests...

116
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,200
Our guests must be over the moon because...

117
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,960
the romantic scenes are there, you know.

118
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,300
You think?

119
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,130
- Make it...
- Don't you like a fairy-tale-themed wedding

120
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,600
- at the hotel?
- Want this?

121
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,000
The fairy-tale theme is perfect
for the beach wedding!

122
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,240
Or the forest theme.

123
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,030
- Want this?
- Nope.

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,020
Wedding in a forest, you know.

125
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,640
Not a forest; what is it called?

126
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,520
- "Forest"?
- It's still forest.

127
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,500
What is it called exactly?

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,160
Pine forest...

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,960
Imagine our guests are seated
in the middle of that.

130
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,070
- Yeah.
- But that would limit the number of guests, no?

131
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,400
Just relatives and friends, yeah.

132
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,930
So that would be...

133
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,120
Around 200 people, yeah?

134
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,500
Whoa! That's impossible!

135
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,010
No way we can invite
only 250-300 people as our guests.

136
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,060
I don't think that will work for us.

137
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
It will!

138
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,670
Beach, an outdoor venue...

139
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,360
Is there a rooftop
space? I'll check it out.

140
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,360
I think a beach or a forest is terrific.

141
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,040
Seriously, it's once in a
lifetime, you know. We should...

142
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,140
You like it too, don't you?

143
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
I like it,

144
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,720
but as for traveling,

145
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,300
not for the wedding. You got me?

146
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,800
You know, it'd be hot and humid.

147
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,960
That is not the right choice for me.

148
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,050
Especially, it's the fact that
we get married just once.

149
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,590
We have to invite lots of people, don't we?

150
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,890
Everyone really wants to come
and congratulate us.

151
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,850
I don't know.

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,960
I think a hotel ballroom
in Bangkok is the answer.

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,330
That'll make all of us happy.

154
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,730
I like beaches, but...

155
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,220
those are definitely not
venues for weddings!

156
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,630
Beaches are stunning;

157
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,930
however, the space is limiting attendees.

158
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,240
We got lots of friends
and relatives coming.

159
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,130
A large number of guests, that's for sure.

160
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,010
I don't think beaches work.

161
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,400
Arm is a friend of so many people.

162
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,430
I... I feel like...

163
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,960
A wedding should
supposedly focus on both of us.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,880
Sometimes, we shift our focus
to a large group of people

165
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,940
when, in fact, it's a
ceremony, not a party.

166
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,530
It's "our" wedding!

167
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
He's like you.

168
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,520
Yes, he is.

169
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,090
- I totally understand Porsch.
- He's just like you.

170
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,760
- In every couple, there's always a person
- But...

171
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
- who wants their wedding
to be small-scale, - Exactly.

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,440
- while the other has many friends.
- While the other wants a big event.

173
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,920
- That's true!
- A big event.

174
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
- That's right.
- A big event...

175
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,920
- They say things that can test a
relationship - He wants a beach wedding...

176
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,680
- are traveling, the wedding, and trips.
- Wedding, right?

177
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,070
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

178
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,880
Oh, my!

179
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,120
A kiss! So cute!

180
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,440
Why do we never dress
each other up like them?

181
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,070
The camera is panning?

182
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,640
- This is what lovers should do, right?
- A pan shot.

183
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,400
- Lovers should dress each other up.
- Right.

184
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,590
- This is what they do.
- He sprayed perfume on him. Arm smiles a lot.

185
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,610
Good sequence, good music.

186
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,610
I thought I'd wanna go home.

187
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,160
- We got a list of activities to finish.
- Yes.

188
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,010
As an introvert might say,

189
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,500
"I feel like going home."

190
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,390
Someone asked me

191
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,440
where our wedding would be held.

192
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,090
- Huh?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,580
What did you answer?

194
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,400
I told them somewhere;
it could be beaches or the countryside.

195
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,520
- And...
- Aha.

196
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,450
What else?

197
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
Or in the mountains.

198
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,600
"Maybe, at a beach," I said.

199
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,500
Then they complimented it.

200
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,020
Hold on...

201
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Hold on a sec.

202
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,120
- How could you answer them that?
- Why not?

203
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,730
- You don't want me to spoil them?
- We haven't come to a conclusion yet.

204
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,040
No, since the afternoon talk,

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
we haven't settled on our decision yet.

206
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,070
How could you answer them like that?

207
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,380
I wanna ask you if this wedding is...

208
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,320
for both of us or for others?

209
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,190
Listen.

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
I understand you.

211
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,500
A wedding is meant to be for two people.

212
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,150
But there are people who desire to...

213
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,220
Ummm, how to say it?

214
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,540
Those people who are willing
to celebrate our love!

215
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,240
So no one would come
if our wedding is held in the countryside?

216
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,480
They will surely come anyway!

217
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,240
Yes, but the venue is not
gonna be spacious enough

218
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,710
and is hard to attend.

219
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,300
It's not very inconvenient, babe.

220
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,700
- It will...
- We got lots of friends, guests, and relatives.

221
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,930
I don't think that's gonna work.

222
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,640
No, it's not what I'm saying.

223
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,080
It's just in another province,
not on another planet like Mars.

224
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,240
Phuket, Hua Hin, something like that.

225
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,370
These people often
travel anyway, don't they?

226
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,290
Well, I already said it this morning.

227
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,240
I want it to be a ceremony
that preserves our precious memories

228
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,400
and makes us smile later.

229
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,160
I don't want it to be a ceremony

230
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,990
for others.

231
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,580
No, no.

232
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,440
It's not for others, you know.

233
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,040
It's definitely for us,

234
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,160
but just that others also
want to celebrate it with us, that's all.

235
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Trust me.

236
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,720
Let's do our wedding in Bangkok
with lots of guests.

237
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,080
Actually, a smaller venue
can reduce some costs.

238
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for some couples.

239
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,930
It's private and personal,

240
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,680
- and we can talk to everyone.
- Right.

241
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,840
But I also want to meet so many people.

242
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
In the end, if the ceremony is private,

243
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,040
some uninvited friends will feel excluded.

244
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,760
- I agree.
- If only a hundred attend,

245
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,120
think about it. Do you have just that?

246
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,770
No, I think those are two perspectives.

247
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,560
For this couple, one is an introvert,
while the other is an extrovert.

248
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,080
In my opinion,
I'll do a two-day wedding ceremony.

249
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
Two-day wedding.

250
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,760
- Good.
- On the first day,

251
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,930
we can make that day for families where
celebrants can closely talk to each guest.

252
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,490
- And another for those who want parties.
- Ah.

253
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,890
So a two-day wedding might be the answer.

254
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,080
I can't side with anyone here.
I'm getting stressed.

255
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,400
- Yeah.
- I don't know!

256
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,600
That's actually a good idea.

257
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,000
The first half can be for families,

258
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,230
and, at night, it can
be turned into a party!

259
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,600
Actually, they can hold two ceremonies
in different months!

260
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,070
- I mean...
- They can fly away overseas.

261
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,720
No one can blame them.

262
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,560
- "We already invited you."
- "Yeah, you just couldn't attend."

263
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,920
To the South Pole?

264
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,680
Yeah? Hold it somewhere far away.

265
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,320
But in the end, for this couple,

266
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,880
there's a quarrel between
an introvert and an extrovert.

267
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
And who's gonna win?

268
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,980
I think large or small
can be interpreted differently.

269
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,880
It's up to their relations
or how close the couple is with people.

270
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,440
Personally, I have a picture in my mind.

271
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,210
I'm like Arm,
I have something planned ahead already.

272
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,320
I don't have someone to marry yet,
but the plan's already ready.

273
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,980
Don't forget to let me tailor your dress.

274
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,080
I have to find out
what nationality my lover will be first.

275
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,740
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
My style is similar to Porsch's.

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,880
I personally like it small.

278
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,460
I don't like chaotic scenes.

279
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,220
However, I understand Arm's thought

280
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,320
of having his relatives gathered.

281
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,320
It's also his day; he might want
to invite his important people.

282
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,990
They might have to...

283
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
- Make a list.
- Yeah.

284
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,520
And cross off some names.

285
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,920
Personally, I like a small wedding

286
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,690
where I can talk
and take care of all the guests.

287
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,830
In reality,

288
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,280
the wedding, somehow,
is not only about two people.

289
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,920
It's more than that.

290
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,440
Especially, Porsch and Arm's wedding.

291
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,680
It's such a huge celebration

292
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,070
after the new law has
been officially legalized,

293
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,550
absolutely fresh.

294
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,280
So I understand Arm's thought as well,

295
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,240
to a certain extent.

296
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,440
However, I like small celebrations,
just like Porsch.

297
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,640
I listened to him and I
was like, "I got you, bro."

298
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,960
So go marry Porsch; I'll marry Arm...

299
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
No, no, no!

300
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,110
No! No!

301
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,548
[September 22nd, 2024
"110 days before the wedding"]

302
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,160
Arm, will you go to London with me?

303
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,210
London?

304
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm not going.

305
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,980
I have to prepare for the wedding.

306
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,000
- So you already locked the date?
- Yes.

307
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,120
Save the date now! It's January 10th.

308
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,000
- Wait.
- It's already on the news.

309
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,760
I'm gonna save the date now, okay?

310
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,410
- Alright, saved!
- Nice.

311
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,730
Well, how many days are left?

312
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,410
Around 3 months?

313
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,120
Ummm, 3 whole months!

314
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,230
Which process are you in?

315
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,780
Mine was prepared one year ahead.

316
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,080
That's insane.
Who'd spend a whole year for a day?!

317
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,830
Try asking others about this.

318
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,480
No way.

319
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,840
Hi, it's Mew.

320
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,970
I'm the only child of Mommy Arm.

321
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,130
I just got married last year.

322
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
[If you could turn back time, anything
you wanted to change in your wedding?]

323
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,780
My wedding was held on Friday.

324
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,430
And that was a troublesome Friday
when the traffic was absolutely a mess.

325
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,400
If I hadn't held it that day,

326
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,640
my friends wouldn't have been
in that traffic

327
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,940
for 2-3 hours.

328
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,070
I felt like I caused
them some difficulties.

329
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,620
If so, it could have been
easier for the guests.

330
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,060
How are your wedding preparations going?

331
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,940
Why are you looking stressed?

332
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,040
- Anything happens?
- We fight a lot.

333
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,920
What's it about?

334
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,060
He wants...

335
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,700
a hotel ballroom,
a luxurious venue, and stuff.

336
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,880
- A large number of guests, and so on.
- A classy one.

337
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,370
Don't you want that as well?

338
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,090
What do you think?

339
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,420
You would want it

340
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,600
slightly romantic,

341
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,320
- more like a gathering with friends?
- That's right!

342
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,480
- I know, right!?
- Yes.

343
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,240
- She knows.
- Like, on a beach!

344
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,440
- Yeah!
- We've been friends for ages.

345
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,720
That'd be so lovely. Bare feet on sand.

346
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,680
- I think that'd be lovely.
- Can I record that?

347
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,780
Sure.

348
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,200
I just feel like it's heartwarming.

349
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,000
- Very cozy.
- True, with just friends.

350
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,040
- True. Under nice weather.
- Just close friends.

351
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,720
- True, I prefer this too.
- Sunset scene.

352
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,680
I used to like this one,

353
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,300
but it sounded like...

354
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,120
a dreamy wedding, don't you think?

355
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,870
I have to ask who your
guests primarily are.

356
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,820
I had mine already, you know.

357
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,470
I'm Thitanun.

358
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,790
I'm Porsch's friend for many decades.

359
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,340
We worked at the same company.

360
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,180
My wedding was held in a hotel ballroom,

361
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,510
it was pretty huge.

362
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,240
I'm the eldest daughter in my family,

363
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,940
and my husband is the oldest son in his.

364
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,320
So it's the first wedding ceremony
of children from both families.

365
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,980
Mine was more like a
reception to favor adults.

366
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,290
That automatically came with cash gifts,

367
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,640
which was undeniably great.

368
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm Bim.

369
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,980
I've been Porsch's friend for...
I think, more than 25 years.

370
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,170
We worked at the same place.

371
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,970
I think a beach wedding is
very cozy and private.

372
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,680
With lights, colors, and winds;

373
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
there, we can have 3D sensations.

374
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,750
I feel like it's giving the vibe.

375
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,000
It must be a memory that

376
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,790
will always have those lights, colors,
and winds tagged along,

377
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,250
all at once.

378
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,080
I like that, it sounds cozy.

379
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,140
Think about it.

380
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,680
But I definitely vote for a beach wedding.

381
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,010
I like a romantic wedding.

382
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,360
- I feel like...
- Think about the reality.

383
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,210
Select the possible one.

384
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,560
Left and right? Yeah, yeah, which one?

385
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,680
As I met my friends, I
got more information.

386
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,650
And with more info,

387
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,470
it's...

388
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,240
They said a beach wedding
can come with uncertainty,

389
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,040
such as bad weather,

390
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,080
or disappointing sunset, you know.

391
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,160
There will also be
some traveling difficulties involved.

392
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,560
Like, the expected guests can't attend
due to those conditions.

393
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,860
Yeah, that would...

394
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,900
I kinda hesitate right now.

395
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,320
I went out to see a friend,
and everything went out fine.

396
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,160
I... don't completely understand

397
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
those people who call
themselves bridezillas.

398
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,120
What do they mean?

399
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,680
I think we still have time,
so many months to go.

400
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,950
Just a few things to prepare.

401
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,460
What are you reading?

402
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,760
- Rashomon.
- Huh?

403
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,130
I'd like to see it in a musical form.

404
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,570
Wouldn't it be great?

405
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,820
It's fun, yeah, yeah.

406
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,470
I think...

407
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,650
I'm so exhausted.

408
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,790
Massage my head, please.

409
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,610
Any tipping?

410
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,490
Massage the head for me, please!

411
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,510
How much will you tip me?

412
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,910
Quickly.

413
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,990
Do it!

414
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,440
How much will you tip me?

415
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,480
I'll tell, do it well first.

416
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,380
Want me to apply more pressure?

417
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,020
What style of massage do you want?

418
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,280
Do it well!

419
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,940
Any style is fine.

420
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,130
Yeah, the nape of the neck. Good.

421
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,500
Oh, that's amazing.

422
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,650
It is...

423
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,460
for your relief.

424
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,200
I'll massage the nape of the neck.

425
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,670
What?

426
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,010
Oh, that feels so good.

427
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,420
- Lift your neck up.
- Okay.

428
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,550
I love you, honey.

429
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,240
I love you too, monkey-pie!

430
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,160
[September 23rd, 2024
"109 days before the wedding"]

431
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Well, Arm.

432
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,950
- Huh?
- About the wedding...

433
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,810
- The ceremony.
- Aha.

434
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,460
I have already made up my mind.

435
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,600
Ah...

436
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,030
We can hold it in Bangkok.

437
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,990
Really?

438
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,580
- Umm.
- Ooh!

439
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,760
Since our wedding will be held in Bangkok,

440
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,720
shall we go look up the hotels?

441
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,280
But I think... the hotels
with gigantic ballrooms...

442
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
are just a few.

443
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,440
- That's alright.
- But...

444
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,180
Huh?

445
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,970
It must be a small one, okay?

446
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh?

447
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,460
Oh??

448
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,670
How can we make it small
if it's held in Bangkok, monkey-pie?

449
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
That's not right.

450
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,140
A small wedding in Bangkok.

451
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,600
I'm giving in a lot, already.

452
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,240
No, no, no.

453
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,160
In Bangkok... Monkey-pie,
you don't understand.

454
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,080
It's in the ballroom. It
has to be enormous.

455
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Am I right?

456
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,430
Arm, I think...

457
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,850
I've tried to understand you.

458
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,460
I'm halfway to you.

459
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,480
- I understand that Bangkok's more accessible.
- No, honey.

460
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,040
Now, you don't get it.

461
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,470
I do.

462
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,360
A ballroom wedding at a hotel in Bangkok.

463
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,890
The wedding has to be substantially large
with numerous guests.

464
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,160
Am I right?

465
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,640
Large numbers of guests...

466
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,930
Arm, you know the invited guests
have to be close to us.

467
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,390
- We're close to everyone.
- Meet me in the middle.

468
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,170
We're close to everyone.

469
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,440
Nope.

470
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,200
I think we need to agree on this.

471
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,110
But you don't understand me now.

472
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,200
I understand you;
you just don't understand me.

473
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,350
Huh? What now?

474
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,820
Yeah, I really don't.

475
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,570
I'm giving in.

476
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
I'm halfway to you.

477
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,560
- That's all.
- That's not reaching halfway!

478
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,270
- No.
- I'm doing my best.

479
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,330
Small wedding in Bangkok.

480
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,300
What's going on?

481
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,910
What is the need to be this frustrated?

482
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,400
No, I'm not frustrated at all.

483
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,140
But... you don't seem to understand.

484
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,360
- In Bangkok. In a hotel ballroom.
- You kept saying I don't understand you.

485
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,600
In a ballroom, you know?

486
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,280
How can there be a few guests?

487
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,650
- That's impossible.
- Then don't do the ballroom.

488
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,120
There are rooms that
can contain 200-300 guests.

489
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm all right with having
the venue in Bangkok.

490
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,110
Oh...

491
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,760
The conflict that can happen,
besides the setting,

492
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,320
is the number of invited guests.

493
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,140
- Yes.
- Right.

494
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,480
That is a big factor to be considered.

495
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,480
- Yes.
- To find a balance for both parties.

496
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
The point wasn't about Bangkok
or another province in the first place.

497
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,480
It was about the number
of attendees, wasn't it?

498
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
- Yes.
- Right.

499
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,760
But Porsch still prefers
a smaller wedding anyway.

500
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,680
- Yes.
- Am I correct?

501
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,840
But his first selection
was more like a destination.

502
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,325
Ummm.

503
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,760
But that was a good
excuse not to invite everyone.

504
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:31,017
Even if you do, they
might not be able to make it.

505
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:31,607
Right.

506
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,360
So the pain for couples is...

507
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,790
I said pain, 'cause he
said, "I'm halfway to you."

508
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,490
- But one's halfway can be different from others.
- Yeah. It's not the same.

509
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,670
- Yeah, true.
- Their halfway can be different.

510
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,120
One's sacrificed his choice
and agreed to hold it in Bangkok,

511
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,080
while the other's halfway
is just about inviting many guests.

512
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,390
There is no single right answer to this.

513
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,780
I think...

514
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,780
Arm is afraid of missing
out on some people,

515
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,060
and is worried about how those people

516
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,920
will feel if they're not invited.

517
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,000
It's up to them how they want to decide.

518
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,480
Now, both of them
have different perspectives.

519
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,760
For us, we could decide,

520
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,280
'cause we did a mini ceremony before.

521
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,080
A new one was meant to gather and
celebrate with our families.

522
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,560
We didn't invite our
parents to our last one.

523
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,120
We also have to
consider our parents as well.

524
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,440
- Umm.
- This is not about the two of us.

525
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,480
People who gave birth to us
also want to celebrate with us,

526
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,120
including families we found along the way.

527
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,200
So, at least,

528
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,880
if your relations with family are good,
you need to have them.

529
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,260
I love them both.

530
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,520
But I think Porsch will give in.

531
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,040
I think Porsch will not change his mind.

532
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,840
- Their chemistry...
- Are we having a bet or something?

533
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,600
I bet!

534
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,840
The bet is...

535
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,840
Porsch will go along with Arm for sure.

536
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,000
Of course, he will.

537
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,600
- Of course.
- There must be sub-conditions

538
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,280
that we don't know.

539
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,500
- Let's continue watching.
- Okay.

540
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,730
(Next Episode)
- Are you still planning on the wedding? - Yes.

541
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
- We're still talking it through.
- That's what I meant.

542
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,360
- We're not fighting.
- I see, but there are some quarrels.

543
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,480
You're making me worried, too.

544
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,480
I think you are too calm.

545
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,140
It's quite late now.

546
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,910
I'm so glad to be able to wear POEM.

547
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,640
Whoa!

548
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,080
3... 2!

549
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,640
One more. 3... 2...

550
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,410
I tried to support him but...

551
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
It's been rough.

552
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,940
I'll say it.

553
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,710
I'll invite him to our wedding, okay?

554
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,200
Alternative-gender couples were known

555
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,080
as alternative genders.

556
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,480
Now, there is more
diversity in the community.

557
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,000
From not being accepted,

558
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,700
unequally treated under the law,
and in daily life,

559
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,570
we were treated as second-class citizens.

560
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,630
We had never received any rights.

561
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,100
I experienced it myself
when my partner was getting sick.

562
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,720
So I learned that
to be legally protected is important.

563
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,000
Not only for alternative genders,

564
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,750
it is for all humans
to be treated with equality.
