[The Legend of Anle]
[Adapted from a novel by Xing Ling]

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
[Episode 3]

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,340
I made the right choice

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,620
to join the Court of Judicial Review.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,500
I read through the case file

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,500
and I found something odd.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,660
Gu Yunnian manipulated those officials

30
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,980
with false accusations against them
fabricated by Pei Zhan.

31
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,180
If Pei Zhan were to remove,

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,500
the entire imperial court
would overturn instantly.

33
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,180
There's one more thing.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,740
A few days ago, Han Ye and I

35
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,420
ran into Gu Qishan downtown.

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,420
He was imperious and acted outrageously.

37
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,700
Strangely, Han Ye

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,980
halted me that day.

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,740
He was right.

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,540
Because the conflict
between Marquis Zhongyi and him

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,500
has been long-standing.

42
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,340
Nevertheless, Han Ye's a gentleman,

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,260
and he's no match

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,500
for a devious fox like Marquis Zhongyi.

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,180
Thanks to his niceties,

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,180
I got to make myself useful.

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,700
To deal with such a cunning one,

48
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,180
aside from some tricks,

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,940
we must catch him off guard,

50
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
uprooting his gang

51
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,220
to clean them up in a fell swoop.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,180
Otherwise,

53
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,220
our short-sighted effort

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,540
will be cut short.

55
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,260
So when can we take action?

56
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,860
The metropolitan examination.

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,780
Li Chong'en, the chief examiner,

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,780
is the henchman of Marquis Zhongyi too.

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,140
So, fraud is very likely

60
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,660
to happen in the metropolitan examination.

61
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,580
This

62
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,780
is the complete name list
of Marquis Zhongyi's henchmen.

63
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,980
Of course, you can assume them

64
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,700
as the accomplices

65
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,020
in the murder of the Di family.

66
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,740
Your Highness.

67
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,340
Your Highness.

68
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,140
If you want to know what's going on,
satisfy your curiosity.

69
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,620
If you care about her, show your care.

70
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Official Ren is inside the room.

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,900
We'll go and check it out.

72
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,020
Wei Shuo, no.

73
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,500
Is this something I can see?

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,220
Wen Shuo.

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,020
Don't be rude.

76
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,820
Cut it

77
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,780
from here.

78
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,260
Slowly cut

79
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,260
from the joint.

80
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,340
I think this requires a lot of practice.

81
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,940
But there are so many criminals
under your control,

82
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,260
it's quite...

83
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,140
Official Luo.

84
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Your Highness.

85
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,700
What brings you here?

86
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,220
I came here for you.

87
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,220
Seriously?

88
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,380
I thought you were here for me.

89
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Good timing.

90
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,100
The punishment I used on the criminals
in the Ministry of Justice

91
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
was somehow lacking.

92
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,220
I heard

93
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
that Official Ren has a knack
for corporal punishment.

94
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,700
Hence, I want to seek her advice.

95
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,100
Your Highness.

96
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,700
Do you mind having a look at it?

97
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Don't be obsessed with the underhandedness.

98
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,980
Your Highness.

99
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,540
I started to learn

100
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,420
because of your advice.

101
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,260
Yet you refused to teach me.

102
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,860
Hence, I seek someone else for discussion.

103
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,420
But this isn't what you should discuss.

104
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
If you said so,

105
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,180
let's discuss this then.

106
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,470
[The List of Handsome Men in the Capital]

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,820
The List of Handsome Men in the Capital?

108
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,540
The top two

109
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,340
are Your Highness
and Official Luo, respectively.

110
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,220
This is absurd.

111
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
What about me?

112
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,700
Truth be told,

113
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,140
I do dabble

114
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,540
in some other things too.

115
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,260
Now that the two handsome gentlemen
are before me.

116
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,820
Both of you shine in your own unique way.

117
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,380
Without a pair of keen eyes,

118
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,220
it's out of the question
to appreciate your beauty.

119
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,940
Let me take a closer look.

120
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,420
Official Luo.

121
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,860
Pretty good.

122
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,220
Your Highness.

123
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,180
Pretty good.

124
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,980
Not you.

125
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,460
I...

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,780
Official Luo.

127
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,980
You look great

128
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,420
in the flesh.

129
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,220
However,

130
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,420
I expect you to be more elegant.

131
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,540
And in this sense,

132
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,780
Your Highness is better.

133
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,660
Your Highness.

134
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm complimenting you.

135
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
Happy?

136
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,420
Can I be your crown princess?

137
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,860
No.

138
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,340
If you don't like her,

139
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,860
why don't you give her to me?

140
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,060
Official Luo.

141
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,940
I'm not an object

142
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,420
to be passed

143
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,540
between you two.

144
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,220
Don't take me lightly.

145
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,860
I mean no disrespect.

146
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,580
Official Ren.

147
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,580
It's just that I think

148
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,340
the Ministry of Justice
is a more suitable place for you.

149
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,660
As you have to obey orders

150
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,420
in the Court of Judicial Review,

151
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,780
which will make you uncomfortable.

152
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,700
I can manage 30,000 navies effortlessly.

153
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,020
300 guards alone is just a piece of cake.

154
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,980
But there's someone

155
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,900
above the 300 guards.

156
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,100
Are all the officials' sons

157
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,500
taken care of?

158
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,060
My Lord.

159
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,300
Actually, these officials

160
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,820
have long bowed down to you.

161
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,940
Why do you need to help their sons?

162
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,060
The favor given now

163
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,420
will be our leverage against them in the future.

164
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,060
Things can run smoothly if we know them better.

165
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
Keep this well.

166
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,940
Yes, My Lord.

167
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,820
My Lord.

168
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,300
Academician Li sent you a message.

169
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,060
He said he would help your son
in the metropolitan examination.

170
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
Li Chong'en

171
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,580
can take a hint.

172
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
It's Marquis Zhongyi?

173
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,500
Scratch that.

174
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,260
After all, I'll have nothing to fear

175
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,540
once I become the Crown Princess.

176
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,060
Good.

177
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,820
You're brave.

178
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,300
Good?

179
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,820
Your Highness.

180
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,300
Was that a green light?

181
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,180
No, it wasn't.

182
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,340
No?

183
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,740
But you nodded just now.

184
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,980
Come here.

185
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,500
Did he nod just now?

186
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,540
Yes.

187
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,060
No?

188
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,820
Your Highness.

189
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,740
A year later,

190
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,180
I'll become the Crown Princess for sure.

191
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,740
Official Ren, you're amusing.

192
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,340
I won't be the Crown Princess if I'm bored.

193
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:20,980
Right?

194
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,540
Well.

195
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,500
I'll continue

196
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,620
with this interesting bet.

197
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,140
I'm not going to stop
until I become the Crown Princess.

198
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,740
Ren Anle.

199
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,540
Yes?

200
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,620
[Ren's Residence]

201
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,540
That's right.

202
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,180
It'll make sense for the Crown Prince

203
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,540
that both Luo Mingxi and I are acquainted
after he found us there tonight.

204
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,820
And he won't have doubts

205
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,740
when you two meet again.

206
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,500
True.

207
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,060
After all,

208
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,500
we're going to join hands publicly

209
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,420
to eradicate all evil lackeys and murderers.

210
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,980
Young Lady.

211
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,500
What's this?

212
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,300
The List of Handsome Men in the Capital?

213
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,620
Yuanqin.

214
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,900
Place it above the candle.

215
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,420
What a good name list.

216
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,900
Next,

217
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,900
we'll start with the biggest fish.

218
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,220
[Marquis Zhongyi, Gu Yunnian]
[Minister of Court of Judicial Review, Pei Zhan]

219
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,860
Everything is all set, sir.

220
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,100
Good.

221
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,860
The metropolitan examination
ends in three days,

222
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,140
which falls on your appearance night.

223
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,660
Perfect timing.

224
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,370
[The 15th day of the 2nd month,
Appearance Night of the Courtesan]

225
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,860
Quite a setup.

226
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm looking forward

227
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,340
to the appearance of the unmatched courtesan.

228
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,660
Ren Anle.

229
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,980
Is this the reason you put aside your books

230
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,260
to come to Lingxiang Pleasure House?

231
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,860
Your Highness.

232
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,620
You're here to catch a glimpse of her beauty too.

233
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,660
Pipe down.

234
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Even a fight

235
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
might need brew to spice it up.

236
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Naturally, I need beautiful faces

237
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,660
to perk me up while reading dull books.

238
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,220
Beautiful.

239
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,340
So beautiful.

240
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,100
She's right, Your Highness.

241
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,740
I really need some relaxation

242
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
after the metropolitan examination
this morning.

243
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,980
Always stay prudent.

244
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
Don't slack off.

245
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,340
Your Highness.

246
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,540
Stop reprimanding Wen Shuo.

247
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,220
Can't you spare me some time

248
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,540
to appreciate your countenance?

249
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
If I do so,

250
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
will you return to the Court of Judicial Review?

251
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,980
Maybe.

252
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,980
Try me.

253
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,540
All right.

254
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,460
You can appreciate my face.

255
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,220
Wen Shuo.

256
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,100
Yes.

257
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,220
Count to ten.

258
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,980
After that,

259
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,860
take Official Ren back.

260
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Count slowly.

261
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
I'll stare at you.

262
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,740
One.

263
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:14,740
Two.

264
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,980
How delicate.

265
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,860
Three.

266
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,540
Why?

267
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,540
Calling it quits?

268
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
I'll be dragged back
to the Court of Judicial Review

269
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,540
after ten counts.

270
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,660
I'm not down for a deal that's less in my favor.

271
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,260
Anyway, I have more chances to see you afterward.

272
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,100
There is no rush.

273
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,420
Out of the way.

274
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,540
Move.

275
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,700
Go away.

276
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,180
Clear this place out.

277
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,540
Leave now.

278
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,300
-Go.
-Leave.

279
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,820
Scram.

280
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,940
-What's with you?
-Move.

281
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,660
What are you doing?

282
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,180
Move.

283
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,340
A familiar face here.

284
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,940
It's him.

285
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,620
Not only him.

286
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,060
Leave now.

287
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,060
[Lin Cong, the son of Lin Guozhong]
Thank you for the arrangement.

288
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,660
[Gu Qishan, the son of Marquis Zhongyi]
Not worth mentioning it.

289
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,300
You're just released
from the Court of Judicial Review.

290
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,180
I must

291
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,060
do you the honor.

292
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,180
Your Highness.

293
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,940
The man beside Gu Qishan.

294
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,180
Isn't he the drunk murderer, Lin Cong?

295
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,420
He is.

296
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,940
A good chance to take them all down.

297
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,820
Do you have any reasons to capture him

298
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,300
when his case is closed?

299
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,300
Go over there.

300
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,060
Who are you?

301
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,820
Get out.

302
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Who are you to drive us out?

303
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,180
Get out of this place now.

304
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,060
What's going on now?

305
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,300
Leave right now.

306
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,940
What has happened?

307
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,300
Come on. Let's look around.

308
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,060
What's going on?

309
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,460
My Lord.

310
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,820
Today is a great day.

311
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,060
Cheer up.

312
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,940
Tell me anything you want.

313
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
Mr. Hu.

314
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,020
Today, I'll take
the entire Lingxiang Pleasure House

315
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,180
for my guest.

316
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,940
My Lord.

317
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,100
I'm so sorry.

318
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,540
But today is the appearance night
of Miss Linlang.

319
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,940
These scholars made their trip here

320
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,540
to catch a glimpse of the beauty.

321
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,060
It's not a good idea

322
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,540
to chase them away, though.

323
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,700
They are merely some lowborn foreign scholars

324
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,180
who come from nothing.

325
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,700
They don't deserve to be here for the beauty.

326
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,820
Listen to me well.

327
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,660
You're undeserved now

328
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,060
and ever.

329
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,420
Once I triumph in the metropolitan examination,

330
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,940
you're even worth less than the mud on my boots.

331
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,540
Who do you think you are?

332
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,940
Stay away.

333
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,820
How could you humiliate us?

334
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,300
Are you undermining us?

335
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,540
-This is ridiculous.
-How could you say that?

336
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,660
You're throwing your weight around.

337
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,540
What a lowbrow sorry bunch

338
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,860
who only bring trouble!

339
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,540
How dare they be confident
that they can ace the examination?

340
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,940
Your Highness.

341
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,300
I'm going to teach them a lesson.

342
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,660
Wait and observe first.

343
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,820
Everyone, look at this.

344
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm soon becoming a marquis.

345
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,060
Lin Cong.

346
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,540
Am I right?

347
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,620
Look how arrogant he is.

348
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,100
His Lordship will rank first,
and I will rank second.

349
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,460
Do you agree?

350
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,660
Yes, rightfully so.

351
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,060
Sounds reasonable.

352
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,060
You'll surely triumph over
the metropolitan examination, My Lord.

353
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,820
Right.

354
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,420
Every one of us will ace the examination.

355
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,660
Exactly.

356
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,820
Let's drink to the fullest tonight.

357
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
It's all on me.

358
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,540
He's overconfident

359
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,420
about the metropolitan examination.

360
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,820
Not only Gu Qishan,

361
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,660
but also Lin Cong, who's just out

362
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,300
seems confident too.

363
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,420
Isn't he the suspect

364
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
the Ministry of Justice failed to capture?

365
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,780
Official Luo, you're known for your iron fist.

366
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,940
But this time,

367
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,540
you've encountered a hard nut.

368
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
I didn't know that Jing State
is such a wonderful place.

369
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,660
Anyone can get a post

370
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,300
if they have a powerful father.

371
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,060
They won't have to be worried
even if they mess up in the examination

372
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,060
because their fathers will help them.

373
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,060
Look how arrogant they are.

374
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,660
Will they even think

375
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,700
that even if they skip the examination,

376
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,940
they can also...

377
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,300
The metropolitan examination isn't child's play.

378
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,660
Don't make any wild guess

379
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,540
without evidence.

380
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,540
Hurry up.

381
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,540
Serve the brew.

382
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,060
Come on. Here.

383
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,540
Faster.

384
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,820
Mr. Hu.

385
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,420
Why hasn't Linlang shown up yet?

386
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,660
You've graced us with your presence tonight.

387
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Hence, Miss Linlang

388
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,420
has to take some time to glam up

389
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,540
for your sake.

390
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Looks like I shall invite her out

391
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,300
personally.

392
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,820
[Linlang, the courtesan
of Lingxiang Pleasure House]

393
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,340
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

394
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,900
Gentlemen.

395
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,620
Tonight,

396
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,020
if you can get this ball bouquet,

397
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,260
I, Linlang,

398
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,420
will serenade you with my song.

399
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,380
-Sure!
-Sure!

400
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,100
Excellent!

401
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,020
Good.

402
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,340
Bravo!

403
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
How stunning.

404
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,700
She's exceptionally gorgeous

405
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,100
and dances gracefully.

406
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,860
Looking at her makes my heart sway.

407
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,340
It's a shame that someone has a heart of stone

408
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,180
and has no response to this.

409
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,180
-Give it to me.
-It's mine.

410
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,300
-It's mine.
-It's mine.

411
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,020
-Over there.
-Don't snatch my thing.

412
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,940
-Give it to me.
-It's mine.

413
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,340
-Don't snatch it.
-Give it to me.

414
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,940
By any chance,

415
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,860
despite her divine beauty,

416
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,420
Your Highness will never fall for her,

417
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,020
instead of me?

418
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
A real man should stand tall,

419
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
and not fall for anything.

420
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,100
Well, then.

421
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,060
If you won't fall,

422
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,860
I'll fall for you.

423
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,100
Official Ren.

424
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,580
Careful, don't fall off.

425
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,940
Your Highness.

426
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,900
I'm going to fall for you.

427
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,260
Ren Anle.

428
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,780
Don't be ridiculous.

429
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,980
I know you really care about me.

430
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,180
You're still holding my hand.

431
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,860
Your Highness, have you fallen for me...

432
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,660
What's that?

433
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,860
Oh, no.

434
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,940
Hurry up and check on him.

435
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,860
Come on.

436
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,580
My Lord.

437
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,900
Let's leave this place.

438
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,260
Hurry up.

439
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,900
Is he still breathing?

440
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:38,940
He's dead.

441
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,780
Lin Cong fell off and died.

442
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,180
Indeed, Official Luo only shows up

443
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,780
at places with death cases.

444
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,540
No doubt, those people will be in trouble

445
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,540
sooner or later.

446
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,100
I wonder if he fell off himself

447
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,580
or someone pushed him.

448
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,220
So, here comes my first case

449
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,980
in the Court of Judicial Review.

450
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,540
[Court of Judicial Review]
I'm from the Court of Judicial Review.

451
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,340
Everyone stays.

452
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,660
I heard that the closing argument
for Lin Cong's murder

453
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,860
was that the victim died

454
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,420
after being pushed by the drunk Lin Cong.

455
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,580
This is indeed retribution.

456
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,940
Who pushed him off just now?

457
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,860
What's the hassle?

458
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,340
He fell off from a height by himself.

459
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,820
What does it have to do with us?

460
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,860
You're the new Official Ren
in the Court of Judicial Review?

461
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,220
She's truly a beauty.

462
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Exactly.

463
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,660
But since you serve
the Court of Judicial Review,

464
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,820
you should show me some respect.

465
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Or do you want my father to chuck you out?

466
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,780
That's right.

467
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,180
It's ill-advised if the Marquis

468
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,100
sends someone over.

469
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,980
I'm afraid

470
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,900
you might lose your job by then.

471
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,900
He's right.

472
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,580
True.

473
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,780
What has gotten into her

474
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,180
to get on His Lordship's bad side?

475
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,860
Jeez.

476
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,780
Sirs,

477
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,140
I'm just doing my job.

478
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,580
Please be understanding.

479
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,180
Please.

480
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Normally,

481
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,940
I would've escorted you back
safe and sound, My Lord.

482
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,540
But unfortunately,

483
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,100
the Crown Prince is here today.

484
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,940
I suppose you know

485
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,860
His Highness well.

486
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Your Highness.

487
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,900
Today, I'm going

488
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,180
to show you the prowess of the boss...

489
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,380
I mean, as the vice minister
of the Court of Judicial Review,

490
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,940
I'm going to show you

491
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,340
my investigative prowess.

492
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,180
I'll surely bring the murderer

493
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,580
to light.

494
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
I know now.

495
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,780
It's you.

496
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,940
No.

497
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:30,860
Not me.

498
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,340
You were the closest one to the deceased,

499
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,420
(and you were following him)

500
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,300
(closely.)

501
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,100
It must be you.

502
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,100
You wronged me.

503
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,260
I've been tight with him.

504
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,100
That's why I was always beside him.

505
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,540
They all know that.

506
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,420
I did not kill him.

507
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,100
Move aside.

508
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,460
Don't look down.

509
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,100
You.

510
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,660
Me?

511
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,100
You stood closest to the railing just now.

512
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,860
The dead was blocking your way all the time

513
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,300
from getting the ball bouquet.

514
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,420
Hence, you hated him

515
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,860
and pushed him down.

516
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,940
You wronged me.

517
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,100
It wasn't me.

518
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,580
I was with Young Marquis just now.

519
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
They can be my witness.

520
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,420
And them too.

521
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Shut up and move aside.

522
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,340
Your Highness.

523
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,340
She kept guessing wrong.

524
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,660
Even I have a better memory than she.

525
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,060
Keep quiet.

526
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,340
Let's just watch.

527
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,060
In other words,

528
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,940
the one who stood closest to the railing

529
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,180
while competing for the ball bouquet
with the dead

530
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,540
could push him down.

531
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,620
And that's the murderer.

532
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,660
It's you.

533
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,660
Not me.

534
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,580
Official Ren.

535
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,420
Please spare me.

536
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,940
Everyone was competing for the ball bouquet.

537
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,860
I just randomly pushed him.

538
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,340
I didn't know he would fall.

539
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,740
I didn't do that intentionally.

540
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,660
I didn't mean to kill him.

541
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,780
See, he confessed.

542
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,780
Your Highness.

543
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,540
What do you say?

544
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,540
Am I smart?

545
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,420
Am I fast?

546
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,340
You're fast.

547
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,100
I don't care about your comment at all.

548
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,860
Yes, Your Highness?

549
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,580
Not bad.

550
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,340
However, with your body control,

551
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,060
you shouldn't have hurt him.

552
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,300
Why do you sound

553
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,860
like a tutor in the academy?

554
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,940
But tutors

555
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,180
would pat on one's head when they praise.

556
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,420
Why don't you pat on my head, Your Highness?

557
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,540
I don't pat. Instead,

558
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
I have a punishment ruler.

559
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,100
Do you want it?

560
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,580
As long as it's from you,

561
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,180
yes.

562
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,180
Enough.

563
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,340
Clean the mess up.

564
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,100
What a bad day.

565
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,060
I lost the beauty

566
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,780
and ended up in a murder scene.

567
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,060
Let's leave.

568
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,780
My lord.

569
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:15,940
My lord.

570
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,340
Let go.

571
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,180
Please believe in me.

572
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,780
Let go.

573
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,660
I didn't mean to kill him.

574
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,540
-Get off.
-I...

575
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,180
I count to three, and you let go.

576
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,860
My lord.

577
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,180
Shut up.

578
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,540
No one is leaving here.

579
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
Ren Anle.

580
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
Don't touch the corpse.

581
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,860
Your Highness, you don't cherish the beauty,

582
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,780
but you might have an interest in this.

583
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,300
Your Highness.

584
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,340
What's this?

585
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,100
Take all of them to the Court of Judicial Review

586
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
for questioning.

587
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,940
Why?

588
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,660
Why?

589
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,300
Why are we being taken
to the Court of Judicial Review?

590
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:05,940
No idea.

591
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,900
[Marquis Zhongyi's Residence]

592
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,500
My lord.

593
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,980
Bad news.

594
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,500
Someone died in Lingxiang Brothel.

595
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,060
Young Master was taken
to the Court of Judicial Review.

596
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,340
What?

597
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,940
Someone died in Lingxiang Brothel.

598
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,820
Young Master was taken
to the Court of Judicial Review.

599
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,180
Useless fool!

600
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,980
How could you let anyone take him?

601
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,180
Your Highness.

602
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,300
The deceased was Lin Cong.

603
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,260
And the exam note

604
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,940
was found on his body.

605
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,460
Cheating in the imperial examination

606
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,820
is a heinous sin

607
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,740
that disrupts the people's faith,
the order of the state,

608
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,980
as well as the emperor's wise governance.

609
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,260
Please scrutinize the case, Your Majesty.

610
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,500
Bring it to me.

611
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,940
I want to know

612
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,580
who's involved.

613
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,580
This note is found on the body
of a fatal fall victim, Lin Cong.

614
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,260
He sat for the imperial examination
earlier today.

615
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,460
[Gu Qishan, the son of Marquis Zhongyi]
He was the son of the Deputy Minister of Works.

616
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,300
And he had a close connection
with the names on this list.

617
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm afraid the leaked answer

618
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,740
might get many people involved.

619
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,460
So, you are accusing them

620
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,180
with only this note?

621
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,460
Did you catch them on the spot

622
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,940
or do you have a witness?

623
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
What if someone framed them on purpose?

624
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,500
Whether this is a setup or cheat,

625
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
we'll get to the bottom to find it out.

626
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,940
Get to the bottom?

627
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,980
Your Majesty.

628
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,580
I'm afraid it might raise a stir

629
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,340
in the imperial court.

630
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,100
Your Majesty.

631
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Please allow the investigation.

632
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,780
Here's the thing.

633
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,980
I will give you three days.

634
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Within these three days,

635
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,540
keep the investigation in low profile.

636
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

637
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,870
[Marquis Zhongyi's Residence]

638
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,020
Official Ren.

639
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,060
It's late now.

640
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,340
Why did the marquis have someone bring me here?

641
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,540
What's the matter?

642
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,500
Official Ren.

643
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,580
For what happened just now,

644
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,580
I won't blame you.

645
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,540
You're naive

646
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,500
and new to the post.

647
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,020
It's understandable
that you forgot to inform me in the first place

648
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,580
when a murder case occurred
in Lingxiang Brothel.

649
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
It's fine.

650
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,540
You will know what to do

651
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,060
next time.

652
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,500
Thank you for enlightening me.

653
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,300
I'm to blame.

654
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,300
I was eager

655
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,220
to impress the Crown Prince

656
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,500
and cause your son

657
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,580
to be taken to the Court of Judicial Review.

658
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,580
Official Ren, you're new
in the Court of Judicial Review.

659
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,820
But His Highness seems to be always around you.

660
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,740
Oh, gosh.

661
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,980
He has been keeping a close eye on me

662
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,340
to check if I read books.

663
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,060
He even

664
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,780
followed me

665
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,340
to Lingxiang Brothel.

666
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,300
I'm delighted to know

667
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,300
that you're on intimate terms with His Highness.

668
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Very good.

669
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,580
I'll surely endorse you

670
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,020
as the Crown Princess

671
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,980
if His Majesty seeks opinions.

672
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,300
Do you mean it, My Lord?

673
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,580
Words from Marquis Zhongyi do carry some weight.

674
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,300
Please sit.

675
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,300
Wonderful.

676
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,580
Tonight's incident has nothing to do with my son.

677
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,300
Helping me

678
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,300
is helping yourself too.

679
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,060
Certainly.

680
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,780
Even if the young marquis is involved in this,

681
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
I would know what to do.

682
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,300
I shall thank you in advance, Official Ren.

683
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,300
I hope

684
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,300
I didn't disturb your night.

685
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,340
Not at all.

686
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,540
Li You.

687
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,780
Show her off.

688
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,540
Yes.

689
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,500
My lord.

690
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,540
Don't forget your promise.

691
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,780
Your Highness.

692
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,940
How did His Majesty respond?

693
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,340
His Majesty

694
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,780
wanted to keep this low-key

695
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,980
since there's no evidence.

696
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,020
Isn't the note

697
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,220
solid evidence?

698
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
His Majesty said so because he had concerns
for the imperial officials.

699
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,740
Not only that,

700
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,980
something's strange about this incident.

701
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,820
True, though.

702
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,540
Logically, Lin Cong should've been prudent

703
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,220
about the cheating conduct.

704
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,540
Why should he carry the notes out with him?

705
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,780
Like he's showing off.

706
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,020
But come to think of it,

707
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,580
he's less conspicuous than the one

708
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,220
who confidently claimed
that he could ace the imperial examination.

709
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
This bunch is

710
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
at Gu Qishan's bidding.

711
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,740
Concerning what you said,

712
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,300
someone has cast a huge web over them.

713
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,220
But who'll stand to gain?

714
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,220
Your Highness.

715
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,300
You've figured it out, haven't you?

716
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,020
Your Highness.

717
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Official Ren is here.

718
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,580
Good timing.

719
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
No need to show her in.

720
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,020
I'll go and meet her.

721
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,020
Yes.

722
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,540
Ren Anle.

723
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,380
You scared me.

724
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,700
I was hoping

725
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,580
to surprise you

726
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,180
since you rarely come out to welcome me.

727
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,380
Your Highness.

728
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,580
Are you not inviting me in?

729
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,980
Let's just talk

730
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
here.

731
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,500
I've been moving about

732
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
for your case.

733
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,340
It's fine if you don't invite me in.

734
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,980
But how could you shut me out?

735
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,380
It's not appropriate for you
to stop by at this hour.

736
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,380
It'll be worse

737
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,540
if you go inside.

738
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,180
It's not the first time

739
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,020
we've stayed together late at night.

740
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,540
Our relationship became complex long ago.

741
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,540
As long as we know we're clean.

742
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,340
What if Di Ziyuan in Dai Mountain

743
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
learns about us?

744
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,980
I heard that you'd send her a gift every month.

745
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,580
I wonder

746
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,540
if you send her an intimate gift like this?

747
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,060
Give it to me.

748
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,580
No.

749
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,860
This is the proof of our close relationship.

750
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,740
I'm not giving it to you.

751
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,980
Ren Anle.

752
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,540
She isn't someone you can joke on.

753
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,980
You're down tonight, Your Highness.

754
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,180
What did His Majesty say?

755
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,860
We only have three days.

756
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,540
If we fail to find ample evidence,

757
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,060
the son of Marquis Zhongyi you hate

758
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,740
might be released.

759
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,580
Feel free to come to see me
at the Court of Judicial Review.

760
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,220
My future father-in-law

761
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,220
is ndeed supportive.

762
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,700
He knows that both of us

763
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,900
must stick together.

764
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,060
I go to the Court of Judicial Review
for the case.

765
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Whatever you say.

766
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,180
Since you're coming,

767
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,940
you're there for me.

768
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,180
As a water bandit,

769
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,460
I know I should put my utmost effort

770
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,380
and relieve your worries

771
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,180
to secure the position of the Crown Princess.

772
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,460
Ren Anle.

773
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,580
I hope that you're serious about the case.

774
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,740
Your Highness, don't forget about this.

775
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,700
With Anle around,

776
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,620
the woes of the people will be lifted.

777
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Hope so.

778
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,460
I only have one concern now.

779
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,860
If I manage

780
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,020
to resolve the case

781
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,260
perfectly,

782
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,620
how are you going to reward me?

783
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,540
If you can find the mastermind
behind the cheating case,

784
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,060
naturally, the people will sing praises of you

785
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,060
and the imperial court will reward you.

786
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,540
I don't need that.

787
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,740
The thing I want is the position
of the Crown Princess.

788
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,620
And I'm sure you know.

789
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,620
But if you can't grant my wish for now,

790
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,420
can you give me a status?

791
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:42,980
What do you say?

792
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,940
Now, let's make a vow to Heaven.

793
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,860
That's our deal.

794
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,660
Please don't renege on your word, Your Highness.

795
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,740
Ren Anle, you...

796
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,620
Look how eager you are
to make a pinky promise with me.

797
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,340
I'm not.

798
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,020
Whether you're eager or not,

799
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,940
we have to complete the task in three days.

800
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,740
We only have three days.

801
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,700
So, please come
to the Court of Judicial Review tomorrow.

802
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,380
We must make it through this tough battle.

803
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,260
All right?

804
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,700
Your Highness.

805
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,860
I will do my very best.

806
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,180
Please come tomorrow.

807
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,940
You almost got me fooled.

808
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,740
Are you not going to send me off

809
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,220
even after you've shut me out?

810
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,870
[Crown Prince's Residence]

811
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,900
Miss.

812
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
They're here waiting for you.

813
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,940
The road you see me off

814
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,940
is so much shorter
than the journey I sent you off.

815
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,460
How about I follow behind your carriage

816
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,940
and finish the journey I owe you?

817
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,460
And then, I won't have to send you off anymore.

818
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,100
That won't be necessary.

819
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,460
Anyway, we have more time ahead.

820
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:10,940
Ren Anle.

821
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,340
Only three days are given.

822
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,260
Why aren't you anxious about it?

823
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
Your Highness.

824
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,220
Both of us have three days.

825
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,180
You can join me

826
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,180
for the investigation tomorrow

827
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,420
so you'll know whether I'm anxious or not.

828
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,220
All right.

829
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,140
As expected.

830
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
You don't say no

831
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
to what you promised tonight.

832
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,420
Miss.

833
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,740
What did the Emperor

834
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,260
and the Crown Prince say?

835
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,220
Speaking of the Emperor,

836
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,460
he'll remove whoever is in his way

837
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,460
by all means necessary

838
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,460
and keep his favored ones in check

839
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,940
with any ridiculous excuses.

840
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
What about the Crown Prince?

841
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,940
Him?

842
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,180
We have so much stuff ahead,

843
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,260
let's not waste time.

844
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,740
[Court of Judicial Review]

845
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,700
Huang Pu.

846
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,260
What in tarnation is wrong with you

847
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,900
to insist on questioning them?

848
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,100
But we won't know the truth

849
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,700
if we don't question them.

850
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,740
How are we going to face the people
if we fail our duty?

851
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
Before that,

852
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,700
how are we going to face His Majesty?

853
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,260
Official Pei.

854
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,900
Given what you said,

855
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,660
we must get to the bottom of it.

856
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,220
You're so simple-minded.

857
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,540
He does have a point.

858
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,460
I find that what Official Huang said
does make sense

859
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,740
before coming in.

860
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,900
The captives

861
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,740
must be interrogated one by one.

862
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,500
If they refuse to confess,

863
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,940
we shall use some punishment on them,

864
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,460
like searching them, giving lashes,
stripping them naked,

865
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,260
and not providing food
for three days and three nights.

866
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,420
Let's see if they'll confess.

867
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,180
You're hopeless.

868
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,580
Stripping them naked?

869
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,420
This is an investigation, not a robbery.

870
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,420
Let me put it this way,

871
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,340
the people involved in this case

872
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
are the descendants of dignitaries,

873
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,900
including the son of Marquis Zhongyi.

874
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,820
If you offend them,

875
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,420
I think your career

876
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,740
is meeting an end

877
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,740
before it starts.

878
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Is it that serious?

879
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,900
Of course.

880
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,420
Official Pei.

881
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,420
You're indeed

882
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,420
the chief of the Court of Judicial Review.

883
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,700
Compared to us,

884
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,900
you're way more insightful.

885
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,140
Official Pei.

886
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,740
Please drink some water and calm down.

887
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,700
I'll obey you

888
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,420
on how to proceed with the case.

889
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,220
Still, it's no use.

890
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,740
Now that His Majesty was informed of this case,

891
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,380
we mustn't take this matter lightly.

892
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,420
You're right.

893
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,860
Oh, right.

894
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,700
If we can't fool them in broad daylight,

895
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,220
we can cut them some slack in private.

896
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,740
Be specific.

897
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,740
Well,

898
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,420
you can task me

899
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,900
with the questioning of those toffs.

900
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,260
By doing so, those dignitaries

901
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,380
won't hold you accountable.

902
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,380
Miss.

903
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,660
I doubt if this is a good idea.

904
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,860
Why not?

905
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,260
From His Majesty to His Highness,

906
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,100
there are eyes on this case.

907
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,900
You should stay away from this hassle.

908
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,300
You might end up losing 30,000 navies,

909
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,820
let alone becoming the Crown Princess.

910
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,740
The loss can be unmeasurable.

911
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Let me tell you this.

912
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,900
To deal with this case,

913
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,020
we have to fulfill three conditions.

914
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,260
To satisfy His Majesty,

915
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,340
to make His Highness feel indebted to us,

916
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,700
and to gain support from Marquis Zhongyi.

917
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
That's right.

918
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Most importantly,

919
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,220
we need the support of Marquis Zhongyi.

920
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,860
What's the next step?

921
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,660
What's next?

922
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,740
Closing this case is a breeze.

923
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,660
We can find several commoners

924
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,900
to be the scapegoats.

925
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,660
Official Ren,

926
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,420
this is risky.

927
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,900
Well, Official Pei.

928
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,340
We shouldn't get bogged down by trivial things

929
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,300
when we aim for something big.

930
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,740
Besides, Marquis Zhongyi

931
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,300
has come to me in person.

932
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,340
He promised

933
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,260
he'd support me to be the Crown Princess

934
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,900
if I could manage the case well.

935
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,260
After becoming the Crown Princess,

936
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
why should I be afraid of anything?

937
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,340
Since Marquis Zhongyi gave me his word,

938
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,900
why should we be afraid of anything?

939

Exactly.

940
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,900
Why should we be afraid of anything?

What a lost cause.

954
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,540
I won't collaborate with you.
