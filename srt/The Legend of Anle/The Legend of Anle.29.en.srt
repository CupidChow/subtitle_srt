When Di Ziyuan sees the token,

154
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,340
she will only hate Han Zhongyuan even more,

155
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,460
which would drive a deeper wedge

the imperial family's reputation
among the public has been impacted.

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,820
If the Emperor did send
these assassins to kill Ziyuan,

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,220
what's the meaning of everything

182
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,060
and sentencing Ziyuan to death
for deceiving the Emperor,

183
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,980
why did he issue a repentance decree

184
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,460
and welcome the loyal souls back to the capital?

185
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,460

188
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,580
I only believe in evidence.

189
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,700
What's that you're holding?

190
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,120
[Plum]

191
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,820
When I sparred with the assassins,

192
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,980
those skills were atypical
for the Plum Blossom Agents.

193
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,180
Judging from their stature and moves,

194
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,180
I'd say they were the people
who tried to kill His Majesty

195
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,220
at the palace's banquet that day.

196
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,530
But we've already discovered

197
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,820
the assassins' identity, right?

198
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,300
They worked for Marquis Zhongyi,

199
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,340
who is dead now.

200
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,530
You mean to say

201
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,180
that it wasn't His Majesty

202
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,220
or Gu Yunnian,

203
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,460
but there's another force in the capital

204
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,820
who wants me dead?

205
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,340
That's a possibility.

206
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,100
Perhaps they weren't aiming at you

207
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,700
but the entire state of Jing.

208
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,180
Jing may look stable,

209
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,580
but in the capital,

210
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
there are several groups of people
vying with each other.

211
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,580
Looks like they've been trying
to usurp state power.

212
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,700
You mean Northern Qin?

213
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,580
If that's the case,

214
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,940
Marquis Zhongyi did die a pitiful death.

215
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,220
After exhausting all his wits and means,

216
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,700
he only realized in the end

217
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
that he was just a pawn in someone else's hands

218
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,100
and a scapegoat.

219
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,580
He deserved it.

220
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,220
It's a chilly fall night.

221
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,340
Drinking liquor isn't good for your health.

222
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,180
Ziyuan.

223
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,580
What are your plans for the future?

224
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,340
If you want to return
to the Court of Judicial Review,

225
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,460
I can...

226
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,460
I'll resign

227
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
and go back to Jingnan.

228
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,460
You're going back to Jingnan?

229
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
You're right.

230
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,820
Good decision.

231
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,700
Once this case ends,

232
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,700
you should return to Jingnan.

233
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,700
That's where your home is, after all.

234
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,460
What are you trying to say?

235
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,060
I thought

236
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,340
you'd return to the Court of Judicial Review

237
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,460
and continue solving cases with Huang Pu

238
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,340
or join the Ministry of Justice

239
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,700
to assist Luo Mingxi.

240
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,460
If you don't want to...

241
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,580
Do you think

242
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,580
I'd stay in the capital?

243
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,460
I hope you will.

244
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,220
But I know

245
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,220
it's impossible.

246
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,700
After all, nothing in the capital

247
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,700
would compel you to stay.

248
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,220
Ziyuan.

249
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
I will request His Majesty

250
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,220
to exempt the regional taxes in Jingnan
for the next three years.

251
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,820
When you return there,

252
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,700
you can work with the people of Jingnan

253
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,940
and restore the place's former glory.

254
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,180
Then, on behalf of the people of Jingnan,

255
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,060
I extend my gratitude to you, Your Highness.

256
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,060
However, rather than an act of kindness,

257
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,580
it's actually a form of compensation.

258
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,220
Despite that,

259
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,180
it will never make up

260
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
for the pain of losing their loved ones.

261
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,630
This has nothing to do with you.

262
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,230
Don't take it to heart.

263
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,630
I just hope that history

264
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,750
won't repeat itself.

265
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,990
Remember the oath you made
at the foot of Qingnan Mountain.

266
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,110
You said you would be a Crown Prince

267
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,990
who would uphold law and order for the people.

268
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,350
Only then would you not disappoint
the 80,000 heroic souls of the Di Troops.

269
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,990
I will never forget.

270
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,110
Then, I can finally return to Jingnan in peace.

271
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,630
Ziyuan.

272
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,630
What I said

273
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,030
back on Cang Mountain still holds true.

274
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,110
Anle.

275
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,870
I can foresee you

276
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,390
forging a peaceful
and prosperous nation with me.

277
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,750
Therefore, as the Crown Prince, I beg you

278
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,380
to stay by my side.

279
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
If you would...

280
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,750
I wouldn't.

281
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,380
(As they returned to the capital
from Qingnan Mountain,)

282
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,750
(not a single word was exchanged
between Ren Anle and the Crown Prince.)

283
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,990
(Vibrant and energetic,
she once courted the Crown Prince,)

284
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,230
(offering 30,000 navy sailors as her dowry.)

285
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,750
(Wise and righteous,
she had solved numerous cases,)

286
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,100
(bringing criminals to justice.)

287
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,750
(Who wouldn't want her to stay by Han Ye's side)

288
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,380
(as the Crown Princess or his right hand?)

289
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,620
(Epic tales will live on forever.)

290
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,580
(The Di family's reputation has been restored,)

291
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,030
(but Ren Anle...)

292
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,030
(No.)

293
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,340
We should call her Di Ziyuan now.

294
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,140
What will be her next move?

295
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,860
[Ren's Residence]

296
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,510
The Emperor has decreed that the Di Troops

297
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,140
were his loyal subjects

298
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
who fought alongside him

299
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,100
valiantly and victoriously

300
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,270
as they annihilated our enemies
and brought peace to the Northwest.

301
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,510
Their merit deserves praise.

302
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,340
Official Di.

303
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,230
His Majesty has a message for you.

304
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,470
"Yongning and I were as close as brothers.

305
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,860
Unfortunately,

306
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,860
fate has played a cruel trick on us.

307
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,380
Di Ziyuan.

308
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,620
For that, I apologize to him with all my heart."

309
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,860
Official Di.

310
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,710
His Majesty also wanted me

311
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,140
to ask you something on his behalf.

312
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,620
Such is his question.

313
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,950
"Now that I have restored the reputation

314
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,100
of the 80,000 heroic souls and your family,

315
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,030
have you finally let go of the past?"

316
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,140
Not yet.

317
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,300
I do not wish to deceive His Majesty,

318
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,470
but I have never let go of the past.

319
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,780
However, I have let go of my hatred.

320
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,140
After all, what had been done to my family
cannot be undone.

321
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,030
Any amount of hatred that I harbor

322
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,430
would not bring back my father

323
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,380
and the 80,000 generals and soldiers
beneath Qingnan Mountain.

324
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,140
My only hope

325
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,030
is that peace and prosperity

326
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,620
will prevail over the state

327
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,710
and that such tragedies will never repeat.

328
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,300
Very well.

329
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,620
I shall bring your reply to His Majesty.

330
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,230
Thank you, Eunuch Zhao.

331
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
Father.

332
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,620
I did it.

333
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,470
The day has finally ended.

334
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,710
However,

335
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,470
did you really mean

336
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,100
what you said earlier?

337
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,620
You mean the part
about not hating Han Zhongyuan anymore?

338
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,540
Have you truly decided?

339
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,030
Yes.

340
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,140
I came here

341
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,230
to prove my family's innocence.

342
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,140
Once everything settles,

343
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,100
I have no more to ask for.

344
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,380
But look at how the Han family is ruling the state.

345
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,230
The government is corrupt,
and the people are suffering.

346
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,860
Do you really think
the Han family can be a good ruler?

347
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,780
I have faith in Han Ye.

348
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,470
He will be different from Han Zhongyuan.

349
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,030
You trust Han Ye that much?

350
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,100
Yes.

351
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
I trust him.

352
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,620
He will make sure this nation
is peaceful and prosperous.

353
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,140
Even so,

354
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,140
Northern Qin is more than eager to conquer Jing.

355
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,380
Making this nation peaceful and prosperous
won't be that easy.

356
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,860
If...

357
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,030
If he can't cope with it,

358
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,780
will you help him?

359
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,620
No.

360
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,140
It's his family's nation.

361
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,780
He will have to defend it himself.

362
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,470
The Jing State, the capital, and the Han family

363
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,230
won't have anything to do with me.

364
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,470
Two days from now,

365
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,380
I will return to Jingnan

366
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,620
and never leave there.

367
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
Mingxi.

368
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,100
Will you come with me?

369
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,860
I'm sure that by now,

370
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,780
the Flowers of Longing must be blooming.

371
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,540
Of course.

372
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,510
Once I tend to the capital's matters,

373
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,860
I will join you in Jingnan.

374
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,100
By then, we'll drink together,

375
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,380
ride on horses, and admire the flowers.

376
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,380
It will be an enjoyable time.

377
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,230
How's everything?

378
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,860
The fake assassins have been exposed.

379
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,620
She didn't fall for it.

380
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,860
We need to use another pawn now.

381
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,070
[Ren's Residence]

382
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,780
What's going on there?

383
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,030
I think there's a rat.

384
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
A rat?

385
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:57,950
Give it to me.

386
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,470
It's me. It's me.

387
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,710
Wen Shuo?

388
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,140
Yuanshu.

389
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,620
You hit me really hard.

390
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,860
I thought there was a rat,

391
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,620
so it had to be one strong blow or nothing.

392
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,300
Why are you sneaking around

393
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
instead of using the front gate?

394
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,030
I'm afraid

395
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,380
that you wouldn't welcome me.

396
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,620
The Crown Prince and Anle

397
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,950
seem to be unwilling
to see each other forever now,

398
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,540
and I'm scared you'd do the same to me.

399
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
Who said so?

400
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,190
He's him, and you're you.

401
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,470
I hope Yuanshu didn't break any of your limbs.

402
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,230
I'm strong and tough.

403
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,190
She can't beat me.

404
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,860
Anle.

405
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,380
Are you really going back to Jingnan?

406
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,300
You heard about it?

407
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,470
I'm going to miss you ladies.

408
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,950
Can you not leave

409
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
and stay here instead?

410
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,030
I no longer

411
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,060
have any reason

412
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,140
to stay in the capital.

413
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
What about the Crown Prince?

414
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,750
For His Highness's sake, can you...

415
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,780
Young Lady.

416
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,710
It's getting late.

417
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,820
Get some sleep. We'll entertain him.

418
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,540
Don't bully him.

419
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,620
Have fun.

420
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,140
Sure.

421
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,030
If you ever mention the Crown Prince next time,

422
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,140
I won't let you off.

423
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,860
You're all leaving,

424
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,780
so there's no next time.

425
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,030
Are you sad to part with Miss Di

426
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,380
or Yuanqin here?

427
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,950
Both.

428
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,030
I'm afraid that once we part ways,

429
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,230
I'll never see you again.

430
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,510
I don't think you came here
in the middle of the night

431
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,620
just to say that.

432
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,800
[Crown Prince's Residence]

433
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,950
Look at this.

434
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
This is all the evidence I found

435
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,470
about another force backing Gu Yunnian.

436
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,470
It's him?

437
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,620
The Left Chancellor?

438
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,030
I didn't expect

439
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,620
his power to grow to this extent.

440
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,470
My Lord.

441
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,430
How very punctual of you.

442
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,190
There's a lot of underlying turmoil
in the palace court.

443
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,820
I suspect the Left Chancellor is up to something.

444
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,750
Ziyuan's suspicion was right.

445
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,100
We were so focused on taking down Gu Yunnian

446
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,140
that we forgot about him.

447
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,140
Still, I haven't found evidence

448
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,380
that he's colluding with Northern Qin.

449
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,030
You need to investigate it thoroughly.

450
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,540
Thank you,

451
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,860
Luo Mingxi.

452
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,910
You don't have to thank me.

453
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,430
This is part of my duties.

454
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,380
Luo Mingxi.

455
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,710
If things hadn't turned out this way...

456
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,860
You would have been my most trusted minister.

457
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,470
There are no ifs in this world.

458
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,620
Also,

459
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,230
I'm returning to Jingnan soon.

460
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,710
If you really want to thank me,

461
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,140
get me two boxes of top-grade candied fruits.

462
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,470
I spent a great deal to gather this.

463
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,950
Don't waste it.

464
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,620
Don't worry.

465
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,780
I will continue the investigation.

466
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,780
You want candied fruits?

467
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,860
Get me some White Dew Tea from Xishan in exchange.

468
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,780
Yuanqin,

469
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,140
you're an amazing cook.

470
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,860
I've been controlling the fire, mind you.

471
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Good heat control.

472
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,860
What is it?

473
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,230
Is it not enough?

474
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,030
There's more.

475
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,860
No.

476
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,380
I was just recalling my past.

477
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,300
I grew up on Wuliu Street.

478
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,380
I was raised by Ms. Zhong.

479
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,620
I rarely got to eat.

480
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,470
There was this time when I went hungry

481
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,380
and fell ill.

482
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,780
When I woke up,

483
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,380
I couldn't remember anything.

484
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,860
I couldn't remember my parents

485
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,030
and where I lived.

486
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,470
I couldn't even remember my name.

487
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
What happened then?

488
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,470
How did you meet the Crown Prince?

489
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,470
I remember that one day,

490
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,230
I joined a group of young beggars

491
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,990
to play at a temple procession.

492
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,620
When we came back, we saw the Crown Prince

493
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,190
standing alone in a rundown temple
on the eastern outskirts.

494
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,300
He was dressed in fine clothes,

495
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,620
so I tried to pickpocket him,

496
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,860
but he caught me.

497
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,380
And then?

498
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,780
Then, His Highness asked me

499
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,860
why I wanted to steal from him.

500
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,300
I replied that my family needed money

501
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,620
and I wanted to help the elders

502
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,780
provide for the children.

503
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,470
I thought His Highness

504
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,540
would drag me to the magistrate,

505
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,300
but instead, he told me

506
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,230
he would get a tutor for me

507
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,780
so I could study

508
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,780
and become successful.

509
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,750
He said that?

510
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,100
The Crown Prince is so kindhearted.

511
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,820
But just when we were about to leave the temple,

512
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,620
a bunch of ruffians appeared.

513
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,860
His Highness was still young back then,

514
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,230
and he was dressed in fine clothes,

515
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,860
so they tried to rob him.

516
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,780
Luckily, His Highness was a good fighter.

517
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,780
He injured their leader,

518
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,030
but that angered the rest of them,

519
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,380
and they lunged at me with their swords.

520
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,030
His Highness protected me

521
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,030
and blocked the attack with his own body.

522
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,100
Wait.

523
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,190
Everyone said you saved the Crown Prince,

524
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,820
and that was how you started to live
in his residence.

525
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,860
Back then,

526
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,030
His Highness insisted that I stay in the temple

527
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,860
until someone came for him.

528
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,230
If the Imperial Guards saw you

529
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,620
guarding the Crown Prince,

530
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,230
everyone would assume

531
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,780
that you saved the Crown Prince,

532
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,780
and he could take you under his wing

533
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,990
with no qualms.

534
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,380
Wen Shuo.

535
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,780
You're a lucky guy.

536
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,230
Yeah.

537
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,030
His Highness is like a brother and father to me.

538
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,140
I think meeting him is the best thing

539
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,140
that has happened to me.

540
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,230
Meeting Young Lady is also the best thing

541
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,030
that has happened to Yuanqin and me.

542
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,100
However, meeting you

543
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,060
is kind of unlucky.

544
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,190
As a well-bred gentleman,

545
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,860
meeting an uncultured woman like you

546
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,140
is also kind of unlucky.

547
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,190
Who are you talking about?

548
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,380
I'm talking about you.

549
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,620
Enough.

550
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,380
You've talked about your past

551
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,580
and bade us goodbye,

552
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
so you should go now.

553
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,540
You're kicking me out?

554
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,860
Just go. Will you look at the time?

555
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,910
Stop keeping Yuanqin and me awake.

556
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,300
It's late.

557
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,540
Go back.

558
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Fine.

559
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,380
My Lord.

560
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,100
My Lord.

561
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,470
Everything is ready.

562
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,860
Let's do it, then.

563
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,860
We'll get it done once and for all.

564
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,620
Yes, My Lord.

565
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,270
[Ren's Residence]

566
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:22,950
Who's there?

567
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,430
Halt!

568
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,470
(Who kidnapped me?)

569
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,820
(Where am I?)

570
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,470
Don't make any noise,

571
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,860
or else I'll kill you.

572
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,470
[Ministry of Justice]

573
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,380
A few days ago,

574
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,670
the former Di servants scattered
around the Northwest city

575
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,380
all received news

576
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,300
that Official Di was almost killed
by the Plum Blossom Agents

577
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,780
on her way to welcome back
the loyal souls to the capital.

578
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,140
Looks like the assassination

579
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,190
wasn't aimed at the court

580
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,470
but to instigate the former Di servants.

581
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,230
It seems that Miss Di won't be returning

582
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,030
to Jingnan easily.

583
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,140
As a descendant of the Di family

584
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,860
and the current family head,

585
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,620
she shouldn't return in the first place.

586
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,860
And the Di Troops

587
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,380
must not land in someone else's hands.

588
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
So,

589
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,990
you mentioned you have something to tend to...

590
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,710
I'm going to help Ziyuan
re-establish the Di Troops

591
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,470
and return them to her.

592
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,190
Of course, I also

593
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,380
need to eradicate anyone
casting their eyes on the Di Troops.

594
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,390
Official Luo, bad news!

595
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,390
Official Luo.

596
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,540
The Crown Prince is threatening
to kill the Left Chancellor in public!

597
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,660
Official Luo, you should go there now!

598
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,470
What's going on?

599
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
Jiang Yu, you audacious ruffian!

600
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,390
Your Highness, what are you...

601
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,180
Jiang Yu.

602
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,700
Release him.

603
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,390
Your Highness.

604
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,390
Must you threaten me like this?

605
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,620
Just agree to my terms,

606
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,540
and we can get what we both want.

607
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,310
Get what we both want?

608
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,390
You want me to commit treason with you?

609
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,950
Your Highness.

610
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,140
Do you know that your current actions

611
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,180
are more than treason?

612
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,540
This is my last warning.

613
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,140
Release him.

614
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,030
Han Ye,

615
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,790
are you afraid that I'll tell His Majesty

616
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,870
the truth?

617
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,390
I've changed my mind.

618
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,030
I'm going to tell the truth to His Majesty

619
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,030
as well as everyone in the state

620
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,220
right here and now!

621
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,030
I dare you!

622
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,620
Why not?

623
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,990
I am the Grand Chancellor of the Left!

624
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,060
You may be the Crown Prince,

625
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,830
but you can't get away with this!

626
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,790

627
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,260
Let me tell you this.

628
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,910
If you want to destroy me,

629
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,910
I'll drag the entire Di family to my grave.

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,310
He killed him!

632
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,310
He really killed him!

633
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,660
He killed him!

634
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,700
He killed him!

635
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,950
He killed him!

636
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,100
The person who will be dragged to hell by you

637
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,790
can only be me.

We're finally leaving this place.

642
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,700
Young Lady, are you going to miss this place?

643
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,540
This isn't my home,

644
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,580
so why would I?

645
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,790
Let's go.

00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,140
My brother is in trouble.

651
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,180

652
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,580
and he's held in prison now.

What an impudent son!

655
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,830
He murdered someone in public?

656
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,100
How audacious of him!

657
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,140
And he refuses to say anything?

658
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,220
Fine.

659
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,510
Fine!

How could we lock him up as a prisoner?

He still knows he's the Crown Prince,

669
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,180
not a butcher or slaughterer?

670
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,870
He killed the state's chancellor in public.

671
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,700
He has no regard for the law.

Just do your job.

680
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,550
You wouldn't kill someone for no reason,

681
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,140
especially the Left Chancellor.

682
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,180
Why?

683
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,100
What's more, you already have enough evidence

684
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,350
to take him down.

685
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,870
You could have let
the Court of Judicial Review handle everything.

686
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,180
Why did you have to kill him?

687

Han Ye.

688
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
Is there something

689
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,660
that you're hiding from me?

690
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,950
After Gu Yunnian killed himself,

691
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,300
his troops were surprisingly quiet.

692
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,180
Someone must be pulling the strings behind it.

693
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,390
Your Highness.

694
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,620
What does that have to do with me?

695
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,740
Gu Yunnian and I have nothing...

696
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,100
Yes, you are different from him.

697
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,140
But you've been harboring plans
even before he did.

698
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,950
Why did you help Di Cheng'en?

699
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,660
And now, why did you kidnap Wen Shuo?

700
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,620
Your Highness.

701
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,780
Since you mentioned Wen Shuo,

702
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,180
I have something to say about that.

703
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,140
Ever since the Di family's innocence
was restored,

704
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,620
His Majesty has been extremely
displeased with Di Ziyuan.

705
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,300
His Majesty may accept the fact
that she's the sole living member of the Di family,

706
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,100
but if His Majesty knew

707
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,140
that her brother, Di Jinyan, was still alive

708
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,660
and had been with the Crown Prince all along,

709
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,620
what would happen then?

710
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,350

711
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,180
I dare you.

712
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,870
Say something.

713
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,140
His Majesty has ordered me
to investigate this case.

714
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,260
How can I get you out
if you refuse to tell me the truth?

715
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,830
If you want to save me,

716
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,620
Wen Shuo has something

717
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,950
that may prove useful.

718
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,030
You can try finding it.

719
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,870
Very well.

720
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,620
Wait for me.

721
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,470
I'll find a way to get you out.

722
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,550
(I thought the Crown Prince was someone gentle,)

723
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,470
(but what transpired today)

724
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,180
(showed me how harsh and resolute you could be.)

00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,010
[Prison]

726
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,870
How is my brother?

727
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,660
Did he say why he killed the Left Chancellor?

728
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,140
He didn't say anything.

729
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,910
I'm going to see him now.

730
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,220
Don't you want to go in?

731
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,300
Perhaps he might tell you something.

732
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,300
Since I'm going back to Jingnan,

733
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,180
it's better that I don't see him.

734
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,180
Pass my message to him.

735
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,350
He promised me

736
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,580
that he would make sure this nation prospers

737
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,780
and people could live peacefully.

738
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,830
He hasn't done it yet.

739
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,660
(You still care about him.)

740
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,180
(It's holding you back.)

741
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,780
(How could you return to Jingnan
