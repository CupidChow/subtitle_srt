It was similar to her handwriting

114
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,970
Her handwriting is sharp,

115
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,970

it's been ten years.

119

Ziyuan is already an adult,

120
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,810
so why is her handwriting still the same

121
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,570
and hasn't improved?

122
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
I guess it's because

123
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,290
her torturous imprisonment in Dai Mountain

124
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,770

Her handwriting is still the same,

126
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,570

like what you said,

213

then without the family's protection,

214

Your body tends to be weak in winter,

227
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,020

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,570
The Han family ruined her life.

374
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,810
I feel sorry for her.

375
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,610
Luckily,

376
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,770
she's now the future Crown Princess,

377
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,610
which is a happy ending after a long torment.

378
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,850
But I don't understand

379
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,690
why you didn't want her to enter the palace.

380
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,530
You knew that someone in the palace

381
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,450
wanted her dead?

382
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,050
No one wants her dead.

383
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,690
It's just that my grandmother dislikes her.

384
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,810
I'm worried that she'd give her a hard time
in the palace.

385
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,050
There is clear evidence
that the Di family committed treason.

386
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,130
As a descendant of the Han family,

387
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,970
instead of hating her,

388
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,930
you sympathize with her?

389
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,770
That's because I believe in Marquis Jing'an.

390
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,450
He wouldn't commit treason.

391
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,970
People are unpredictable, though.

392
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,370
As a descendant of the Di family, Marquis Jing'an

393
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,850
was indignant when the Hans
became the sole imperial family,

394
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,850
so he deployed 80,000 men
away from Jingnan without permission

395
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,610
and colluded with Northern Qin

396
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,610
to start a rebellion.

397
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,450
You were still young back then.

398
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,090
You wouldn't know what they were fighting for.

399
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,610
Besides,

400
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,290
you've only met him several times.

401
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,970
Why are you so certain
that he wouldn't commit treason?

402
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,290
Marquis Jing'an killed himself
to prove his innocence.

403
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,370
He was an honest man

404
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,690
and the Emperor's friend since young.

405
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,810
He wouldn't deploy the soldiers for no reason.

406
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,410
Unless...

407
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,130
Did you know

408
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,890
how the 80,000 men

409
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,770
from the Di troops died?

410
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,770
They were quashed by rolling boulders

411
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,690
and arrows from everywhere.

412
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,530
(Before the soldiers could even yell,)

413
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,290
(they had already turned into
a mess of blood and flesh.)

414
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,130
The golden sands at the foot of Qingnan Mountain

415
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,370
were dyed red for a thousand li.

416
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,370
Can you imagine how tragic it was?

417
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,130
Enough!

418
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,770
Say no more!

419
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,770
While you toss and turn in your bed every night,

420
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,690
do you hear the Requiem playing by your ear

421
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,690
and imagine how 80,000 men

422
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,090
were brutally slaughtered?

423
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,050
I told you to say no more!

424
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,970
General.

425
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,690
Is everything alright?

426
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,370
Yes.

427
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,090
You may leave.

428
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,730
Yes, General.

429
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,690
Marquis Jing'an deployed the soldiers

430
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,770
because he received a secret letter

431
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,690
penned in handwriting
similar to that of the Emperor.

432
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,130
Who sent the letter?

433
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,530
Princess.

434
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,130
I believe that both you and I don't want

435
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,770
anything bad to happen to Ziyuan.

436
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,770
But now, only you can save her

437
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,290
and prove the Di family's innocence.

438
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,370
You want me

439
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,530
to tell everyone the truth?

440
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:44,770
Yes.

441
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,610
Luo Mingxi.

442
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,490
I am the Princess of Jing.

443
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,290
80,000 men of the Di troops died a wrongful death.

444
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,530
Your family owes them justice.

445
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,770
Do you want Ziyuan

446
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,130
to end up like your former servant Liangxi,

447
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,450
turning into

448
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,730
a cold, lifeless corpse

449
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,610
mysteriously someday...

450
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,290
Enough!

451
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,610
I will protect her.

452
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,290
Princess.

453
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,050
-Now...
-Enough.

454
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:09,890
Lengbei.

455
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,290
Show our guest out.

456
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,130
Official Luo.

457
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,610
The general would like to rest.

458
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,850
Please leave now.

459
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,890
Princess.

460
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,290
I hope you will consider

461
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,610
what I have told you just now.

462
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,770
As long as you're willing,

463
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,650
80,000 men of the Di troops

464
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,690
will rest in peace,

465
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,890
and Ziyuan will live her days

466
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,290
happily and peacefully.

467
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,770
Farewell.

468
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,340
This winter night is as cold

469
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,420
as the day the Di family was exterminated.

470
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,660
How I wish to return to the Northwest

471
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,420
so I can kill our enemies

472
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,900
and die on the battlefield.

473
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,940
It's better than dealing

474
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,020
with the scheming people here.

475
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,660
Your Highness.

476
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,180
You always tell me to stay focused
while studying,

477
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,180
but now, even though you're sitting
at your work desk,

478
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,500
your heart

479
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,620
has wandered off to Anle's side.

480
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,940
Ridiculous.

481
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,420
Give it back.

482
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,740
Your Highness.

483
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
Can't you just follow your heart

484
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,700
and live the way you want?

485
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,540
Give it back.

486
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,020
Here.

487
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,340
Unfortunately,

488
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,820
what is done cannot be undone.

489
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,740
The palace is holding a New Year's Eve banquet,

490
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,620
and Di Cheng'en is cordially invited.

491
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,470
[Invitation]

492
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,820
[Jingxin Hall]

493
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
Your Majesty.

494
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,020
The guest list for the New Year's Eve banquet
has been confirmed.

495
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,340
It's the same people every year.

496
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,180
Just give the orders

497
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,340
for the preparations.

498
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Your Majesty.

499
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,660
This year,

500
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,380
Di Cheng'en will be attending too.

501
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,500
What?

502
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,900
His Majesty invited her.

503
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,740
The Emperor?

504
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,660
Oh, Emperor.

505
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,900
I can cooperate

506
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
with any of your plans

507
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,420
except for this.

508
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,340
You've crossed the line.

509
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,940
This is a family banquet.

510
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,020
No one from the Di family can come.

511
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,380
Why did you call me over

512
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,340
at this hour?

513
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,660
I just wanted to ask

514
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,660
how your plans are proceeding, Your Highness.

515
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,940
I have obtained some intelligence.

516
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,500
What about Di Cheng'en

517
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,100
on your side?

518
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,340
Di Cheng'en

519
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,660
has agreed to ally with us.

520
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,940
However,

521
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,020
we'll need your help to ensure

522
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,340
that she becomes the Crown Princess safely.

523
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,580
Tell me more.

524
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,980
Tomorrow's New Year's Eve banquet

525
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,940
is the best opportunity for us to act.

526
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,270
[Invitation]

527
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,750
[To Di Cheng'en]

528
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,380
Since the Crown Prince insists on his ways,

529
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,180
the Empress Dowager is now
desperate to get rid of Di Cheng'en.

530
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,900
Still, the banquet will be held in the palace.

531
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,820
It won't be easy for us to infiltrate.

532
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,180
However, Di Cheng'en has to remain safe.

533
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,740
We have to save her, but not by our own people.

534
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Since the Princess refuses to reveal the truth,

535
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,860
we need to give her a push.

536
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,460
Make sure this message

537
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,180
reaches Anning.

538
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,940
Yes, sir.

539
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,570
[Yuanshui Pavilion]

540
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,940
Mu Qing?

541
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,180
Is that you, Mu Qing?

542
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,020
Miss Di.

543
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,940
The owner of the red umbrella
has a message for you.

544
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,940
The water is perfectly warm.

545
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,140
Mu Qing.

546
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,740
Thank you.

547
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,940
I think it's best

548
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,020
that you don't attend the banquet.

549
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,660
I know how to deal

550
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,380
with my own matters.

551
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,180
The Empress Dowager dislikes you.

552
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
You weren't invited

553
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,940
out of their goodwill.

554
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,740
I know the Empress Dowager better than you do.

555
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,500
I don't need you to remind me.

556
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
I'm taking a bath now.

557
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,380
(Just wait and see.)

558
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,340
(I'm going to become the Crown Princess.)

559
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,420
Young Lady, you look gorgeous in this dress.

560
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,420
Really?

561
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,340
Yes.

562
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,740
All right.

563
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,580
Lengbei?

564
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,100
You're a princess too.

565
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,660
Don't yell for no reason

566
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
and embarrass our people.

567
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
It's your fault.

568
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,820
Why did you scare me from behind?

569
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,180
Yes.

570
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,180
I am timid

571
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,900
and jittery.

572
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,340
I can't hold a candle

573
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,660
to Princess Anning, whom you're protecting.

574
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,020
Don't attend the banquet

575
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,220
at the palace tonight.

576
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,940
Why not?

577
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,420
I'm not eager to become
the Crown Princess anymore,

578
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,940
so can't I just go there and enjoy myself?

579
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,420
You promised me

580
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
that you'd listen to me.

581
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
I was even planning to have fun with Anning.

582
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,820
You can see her every day,

583
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,420
yet you won't let me meet her.

584
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,940
You know what?

585
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Many things

586
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,980
are not as simple as you think.

587
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,820
The palace banquet may sound fun,

588
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,660
but there is danger lurking everywhere.

589
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,180
I just don't want you to get hurt,

590
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,420
understood?

591
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,260
I won't go, then.

592
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,580
I heard that the banquet

593
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,940
will be serving many delicious desserts.

594
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,500
What a pity.

595
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,820
Don't worry.

596
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,140
When I visit you next time,

597
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,340
I'll bring some desserts for you.

598
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,500
Lengbei.

599
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,420
I know you get along well

600
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,820
with Princess Anning,

601
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,420
but when things turn dangerous,

602
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,420
you have to take care of yourself.

603
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,020
(Princess.)

604
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,660
(I believe that both you and I don't want)

605
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,420
(anything bad to happen to Ziyuan.)

606
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,180
(But now, only you can save her)

607
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,940
(and prove the Di family's innocence.)

608
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,940
(Ziyuan.)

609
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,660
(I'm sorry.)

610
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,500
(I can't do it.)

611
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,100
Your Highness.

612
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,740
The warm water is ready.

613
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,180
Got it.

614
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,780
"Tonight's New Year's Eve banquet.

615
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,420
Di Cheng'en will be in danger."

616
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,970
[Yuanshui Pavilion]

617
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,180
You look beautiful today.

618
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,420
After tonight,

619
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,940
everything will get better.

620
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,940
Tonight's banquet is dangerous.

621
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,740
How so?

622
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,420
You have to believe me.

623
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,820
Everything I do is for your own good.

624
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,300
Good?

625
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,740
Mu Qing.

626
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,700
You're right.

627
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,420
They're inviting me to join their banquet.

628
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,140
Isn't that good?

629
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,620
Marquis Zhongyi is looking for Zhong Hai?

630
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,140
Yes.

631
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,820
They've been searching for quite some time.

632
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,300
Apparently, it has something to do
with the Marquis's son.

633
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,060
Follow the Marquis's men discreetly

634
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,180
and act accordingly.

635
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,780
Since Marquis Zhongyi wants
to kill Zhong Hai to silence him,

636
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,060
we need to help him

637
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,620
complete the job.

638
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,620
Yes, My Lord.

639
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,940
How wise of you, My Lord.

640
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,620
Your Highness.

641
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,300
Today is New Year's Eve.

642
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,820
Can't you cheer up?

643
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,500
Smile.

644
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,900
I guess it's better

645
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,140
that you don't smile.

646
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,500
Are you afraid

647
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,100
that Miss Di would be humiliated

648
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,700
at the banquet tonight?

649
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,420
Things are different now.

650
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,540
No one would dare to do so.

651
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,900
Not necessarily.

652
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,700
Ye!

653
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,420
What is it?

654
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,140
You're all flustered.

655
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,060
I received a note that said

656
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,060
Ziyuan will be in danger.

657
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,900
Many members of the imperial family
will be attending.

658
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,420
Grandmother won't give her a hard time in public.

659
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,420
Rest assured.

660
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,620
Grandmother sees her as a foe and threat.

661
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,220
She won't treat her kindly.

662
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,740
Let's enter the palace now.

663
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,380
Ziyuan needs us.

664
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,220
Sure.

665
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,380
Let's enter the palace now.

666
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,300

Young Lady!

669
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,540
I found Zhong Hai.

670
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,980
Where is he?

671
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,620
Wuliu Street.

672
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,220
He's been pursued by Gu Yunnian's men.

673
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,700
You guys...

674
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,820
[Servant of the Zhong family, Zhong Hai]
Who are you guys?

675
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,300
Kill him!

676
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,220
Out of my way!

677
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,780
You're ganging up on one person?

678
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,540
I'd love to see

679
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,780
who dares to take him away from me.

680
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,420
Let's go!

681
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,100
Come on, let's go.

682
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,060
Go.

683
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,540
Come on.

691
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,500
Yeah.

692
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,740
Let's go.

693
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,860
What a disaster.

694
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,460
I heard Official Ren stormed into the fire!

695
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,060
Really?

696
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,900
How could this happen?

697
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,940
The fire is still blazing!

698
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,300
It's so dangerous.

699
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,100
How could she storm in alone?

700
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,380
Does she have a death wish?

701
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,220
Anning, go to the palace now.

702
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:51,980

703
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,900
Stay safe.

704
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,220
You have to save Anle.

705
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,700
(Only I can save Ziyuan now.)

706
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,820
Are you okay?

707
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,620
I'll get you out.

708
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,220
We can't get out now.

Don't give up just yet.

Let me check your injuries
before we plan our next step.

My injuries aren't as serious as the fire.

How could you still joke around at this time?

714
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,300
You're made of flesh and bones.

You're here to save me, after all.

Have you thought about what would happen
if I were here any later?

How much longer must you make me worry?

718

Your Highness, if you don't want to get worried,

719
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,540
you didn't have to come.
