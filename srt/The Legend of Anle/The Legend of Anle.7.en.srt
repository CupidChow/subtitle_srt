"Requiem".

49

It's a lament from the frontier,

50
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,950

never been to the borders.

69
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,630
But I learned about the suffering of war

70
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,000
through poetry and plays.

71

72
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,870

75

Stop talking about promotions.

76

A general's success

77
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,190
is based on countless lives.

78
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,750
Rule the country by virtue.

79
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,630
Lead the army with extraordinary tactics.

80
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,190
Rule by doing nothing.

81
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,070
Sages avoid deploying their troops

82
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,430
and only deploy them
when it's absolutely necessary.

83
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,120
How can someone who taught me that

84
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,560
collude with the enemy?

85
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,310
We're like sisters,

86
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,070
but you're much more cultured than I am.

87
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,600
But Miss Linlang is wrong.

88
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,510
As soon as you go to war, you're an enemy.

Dongqian has never gone easy on us.

90
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,870
So I'll do the same.

91
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,190
I wondered why you look familiar.

92
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,750
You have her eyes.

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,040

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,600
for getting drunk outside.

96
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,480
Let's go home, General.

97
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,270
No.

98
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,950
I already booked the entire place.

99
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,160
So I must make full use of it.

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,070
Please rest

101
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,720
in my bedroom then.

102
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,510
Requiem.

103
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,320
All right.

104
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,630
-Requiem.
-All right.

105
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,480
If you keep making a fuss,

106
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,670
there would be no requiem.

107
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,870
Make her a bowl of hangover soup.

108
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,240
Anning.

109
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,080
Hurry. Sit.

110
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,390
Look at this.

111
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
A general under my command

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,320
got this pendant

113
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,080
while passing Jiangnan.

114
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,240
Take a good look

115
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,790
at what's on it.

116
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,000
He dared not keep it
after seeing the emblem at the back.

117
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,200
So he gave it to me.

118
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,390
When Di Yongning was made Marquis Jing'an,

119
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
the Founding Emperor granted him
the right to mint coins.

120
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,910
After the Di family was massacred,

121
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,360
money is prohibited from circulation.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,440
This pendant

123
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,960
was hastily made from Jing'an's silver coins.

124
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,240
That's why it still has the words from the coins.

125
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,630
"Eighty thousand soldiers

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,840
were killed on Qingnan Mountain. No one survived."

127
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,240
This pendant means someone is still alive.

128
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,480
There is a soldier out there who knows the truth.

129
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,320
This is the first time

130
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,390
I've ever hoped someone became a deserter...

131
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,790
and survived.

132
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,630
Survived...

133
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,600
Your Highness.

134
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,600
Are you here to check on me

135
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,030
or Princess Anning?

136
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,790
I'm here to see

137
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,200
my sister.

138
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,300
Princess Anning has Lengbei to take care of her
when she's drunk.

139
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
When I get drunk,

140
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,990
I'm all alone.

141
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,030
Where are Yuanshu and Yuanqin?

142
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,350
They're quite discerning.

143
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,060
They want me to have some alone time with you,

144
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,180
so they didn't come over.

145
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,750
Who knew you'd be so unromantic

146
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,540
and still have another woman on your mind?

147
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,580
Ziyuan

148
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,510
also played "Requiem"

149
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,150
when she was little.

150
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,990
You look careless,

151
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,750
but you

152
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,900
understand the meaning of this song.

153
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,350
So... Anle.

154
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,110
Ziyuan isn't some other woman.

155
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,940
Her existence

156
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,390
embodies the country's past.

157
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,900
You think you know me

158
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,150
and Di Ziyuan of Dai Mountain.

159
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,300
Actually,

160
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,300
there is nothing to worry about,
people just overthink things.

161
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,180
It seems

162
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,300
that you're nothing but average.

163
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,750
There is nothing to worry about,

164
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,630
people just overthink things.

165
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,990
Ren Anle.

166
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,420
Are you really that carefree?

167
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,150
"Requiem" was marvelously arranged.

168
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,540
The tragic and stirring emotions in the song

169
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,350
would make anyone uneasy.

170
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,150
Anning is sentimental.

171
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,940
She told me about a past incident
after hearing the song.

172
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,390
Anning gave this to me when she was drunk.

173
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,470
It's an unexpected gain.

174
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,510
Look at the word "Jing'an" on it.

175
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,780
Did my father

176
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,470
[Jing'an]
write it when minting coins?

177
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,150
Yes.

178
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,750
If that's the case,

179
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,630
the Di family has survivors

180
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,350
from the Qingnan Mountain case.

181
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,990
And they're in Jiangnan, where I've lingered
to achieve my plan for a long time.

182
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,820
That's good news.

183
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,630
I've sent Linlang

184
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,230
to search every corner of the Northwest,

185
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,470
but we didn't find any survivors.

186
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,230
Except for Jiangnan.

187
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,990
Jiangnan is Marquis Zhongyi's territory.

[Marquis Zhongyi's Residence]

195
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,820
My Lord, Official Zhong sent a letter.

196
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,420
A refugee is heading to the capital

197
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,750
with a blood letter written by the people.

198
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,060
Useless crap.

199
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,870
After making such a big mess,

200
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,870
I have to clean it up.

201

My Lord.

202
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,510
I've sent someone

to stop the refugee.

to settle everything
that needs to be settled in Jiangnan.

206

Don't leave anything they could use against us.

207
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,110
Yes.

208
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,580
Anle wants to go to Jiangnan.

But that's Gu Yunnian's territory.

210
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,630
We have to find a way

211
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,110
to get her there.

212
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,180
Jiangnan has been plagued by the rain lately.

213

But Gu Yunnian's men

214
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,630
stopped the memorial to the throne.

If the palace can't hear about it,

216
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,180
we'll make the people

about Jiangnan's governor, Zhong Liwen.

Hurry. Take him inside!

What's this?

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,990
A blood letter written by the people.

238

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,380
Jiangnan is unlike any other place.

330
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,540
I know.

331
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,230
Jiangnan has a long history of problems.

332
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,270
It's time for a crackdown.

333
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,430
Jiangnan used to be the most prosperous place
in the Jing State.

334
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,470
But it's now a disgrace.

335
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,470
You held back from taking action

336
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,190
and made it a problem.

Crown Prince.

338
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,030
It's not that I don't want you to go.

339
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,070
It's just that you're the son of an emperor
and should stay away from danger.

340
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,950
You're the future ruler of the Jing State

341

and my precious crown prince.

342
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,030
But, Your Majesty,

343
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,550
you're the ruler.

344
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,070
The people are my kins.

345
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,310
How can I sit by and do nothing just to stay safe

346
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,990
when people are suffering?

347
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,510
The forces in the court are complicated.

348
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,510
And Gu Yunnian kept losing.

349
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,750
A new situation is emerging.

350
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,950
You've now gotten Han Ye
involved with the Jiangnan case.

351
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,230
I think Han Zhongyuan

352
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,580
probably has no other choice.

353
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,230
The palace is out of touch with reality.

354
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,140
But Han Ye has no choice but to deal with

355
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,990
Jiangnan's flood.

356
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,030
We don't need to plot anything.

357
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,030
He'll get involved himself.

358
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,790
He's open-hearted, so it goes without saying.

359
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,340
This trip to Jiangnan will be risky.

360
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,030
But Han Zhongyuan knows

361
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,340
that Han Ye will have someone to keep him safe.

362
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,710
And I'm that someone.

363
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,230
Ren Anle.

364
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,230
Han Zhongyuan is not a fool.

365
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,790
He hasn't had time to think about

366
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,070
whether or not you're after his good looks.

367
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,420
It's only because

368
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,510
you've offended Gu Yunnian

369
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,310
and every other court official.

370
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,470
You also do things

371
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,230
your way.

372
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,510
So he trusts you.

373
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,750
But you

374
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,790
remain the key player in this game.

375
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,900
So Han Ye must beg me

376
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,030
for this trip to Jiangnan.

377
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,470
[Ministry of Justice]

378
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,100
Luo Mingxi.

379
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,820
I have no idea

380
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,030
you like playing with mud.

381
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,750
You have a privileged life,

382
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,470
so you probably don't know this fun folk activity.

383
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,820
Are you simulating a riverbank?

384
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,470
You're not too slow to react.

385
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,990
Even a riverbank I made randomly is so sturdy,

386
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,100
let alone

387
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,750
the dam built by 500 river workers

388
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,750
and with a large fund from the imperial court.

389
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,270
Luo Mingxi.

390
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,470
Will you go to Jiangnan with me?

391
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
It's Official Luo.

392
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,580
Official Luo.

393
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,380
Will you...

394
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,140
I refuse.

395
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,100
Jiangnan's so far away.

396
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,950
I'm weak. I'm scared I won't come back alive.

397
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,270
Besides,

398
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,990
don't you

399
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,710
have a more suitable candidate than me?

400
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,270
I refuse.

401
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,860
Why?

402
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,230
Didn't you hand me the blood letter?

403
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,620
That's because I thought you could fix it alone.

404
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,580
I didn't expect you

405
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,030
to need help.

406
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,510
Ren Anle, this is a big deal.

407
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,070
I chose you

408
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,230
because Anle Abode has been in Jingnan for years.

409
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,070
You survived a lot of water wars and floods.

410
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,230
You're experienced.

411
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,100
You will be of great help

412
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,510
when we are in Jiangnan.

413
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,820
Are you begging me?

414
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,380
I've also begged you a couple of times.

415
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,550
I didn't expect you

416
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,750
to beg others like this.

417
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,710
You must have a certain attitude
when begging others for help.

418
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,310
Indeed.

419
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,580
You must at least hold a decent banquet

420
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,750
to ask for help from people from Anle Abode.

421
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,230
You can only show your sincerity

422
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,230
after drinking dozens of bottles of liquor.

423
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,270
There are no problems with eating and drinking.

424
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,100
I can do it.

425
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,340
You can't.

426
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,510
Whoever is asking for help shall drink.

427
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,550
Your Highness.

428
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,790
I don't think I can help you

429
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,550
with this.

430
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,470
Fine.

431
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,180
Fine?

432
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,270
Your Highness, you never drink.

434
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,510

438
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,580
Are you willing to let the Crown Prince go?

439
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,710
What else can I do?

440
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,340
But

441
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,790
I'll be worried if he goes alone.

442
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,660
Your Majesty.

443
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,230

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,550
Official Ren?

445
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,310
This female pirate

446
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,950
is interesting.

447
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,470
There's

448
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,990
no better person for the job right now.

449
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,030
Official Ren and Marquis Zhongyi
are now enemies in the imperial court

450
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,340
because of
the metropolitan examination cheating case.

451
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,270
Official Ren

452
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,750
will help the Crown Prince

453
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,860
during their trip to Jiangnan.

454
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,070
Ren Anle

455
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,340
seems like someone who will do anything

456
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,470
for the Crown Prince.

457
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:58,990
All right.

459
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,100
Yes.

460
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,950
Contact the Han family's old staff in Jiangnan.

461
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,070
Tell them

462
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,230
the Crown Prince will go to Jiangnan soon.

463
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,750
Tell them to help him out.

464
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,310
Yes.

465

[Crown Prince's Residence]

466
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,510
Your Highness, there are ten dishes,

467
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,990
including chicken, duck, and fish,

468
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,750
symbolizing prosperity
brought by the dragon and the phoenix.

469
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,550
There are also 30 premium Nyuerhong,

470
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,270
representing a harmonious relationship.

471
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,270
Who told you to do these?

472
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,820
Well...

473
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,510
Miss Yuanshu sent this over in the afternoon.

474
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,380
What I said is written on it.

475
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,990
I'm only reading it out.

476
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,030
Miss Yuanshu said

477
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,510
these are their young lady's favorite dishes

478
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,750
and asked us to prepare them.

479
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,750
Is there something wrong, Your Highness?

480
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,990
I'll have people remove them right away.

481
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,340
Never mind.

482
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,030
Just let it be.

483
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,900
Don't bring up

484
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,750
those meanings anymore.

485
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,470
Yes.

486
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,470
Your Highness.

487
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,310
Don't you think Crown Prince's Residence

488
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,310
is decorated like a wedding chamber today?

489
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,030
Did they ask you to do this too?

490
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,580
Yes.

491
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,620
Miss Yuanshu repeatedly told us

492
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,990
that this is what their young lady likes.

493
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,750
Ridiculous.

494
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,030
Your Highness.

495
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,750
I'm here.

496
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,070
Dig in. Here.

497
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,710
Ren Anle.

498
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,860
Here's to you.

499
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,580
I'm giving you this toast for helping me
solve the metropolitan exam cheating case.

500
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,340
I also hope you can follow me

501
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,510
to Jiangnan to handle the flood.

502
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,340
You should indeed give me a toast.

503
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,750
But I think it's a shame

504
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,070
if you're only doing it
to ask me to work with you.

505
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,230
I wonder

506
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,270
when you will ask me to marry you.

507
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,070
Ren Anle.

508
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,030
I'm serious.

509
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,230
It would truly be a shame

510
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,790
if you don't work on this case with me.

511
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,340
Fine.

512
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,580
Since you're so sincere,

513
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,230
you shouldn't give a toast like this.

514
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,950
Bring us those liquors.

515
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,990
The liquor in the capital smells so good.

516
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,470
Smell it.

517
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,550
Your Highness, drink.

518
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,990
Anle.

519
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,230
His Highness can't hold his liquor.

520
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,310
What about you?

521
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:42,990
I...

522
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,510
Mr. Wen, please.

523
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,310
Your Highness.

524
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,580
Drink up.

525
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,820
This liquor isn't a problem for you, is it?

526
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,230
Ren Anle.

527
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,550
If I finish this liquor,

528
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,750
will you travel to Jiangnan with me?

529
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,510
I always keep my word.

530
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:08,950
All right.

531
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,470
I'll drink with you today.

532
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,230
Bottoms up.

533
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,340
Your Highness.

534
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,340
Do you know

535
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,100
that for people from Anle Abode,

536
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,070
Nyuerhong is a liquor you drink
when you get married?

537
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,710
Now that you've drank my liquor,

538
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,070
that makes you mine.

539
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,550
Have more.

540
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,180
"Shaky nine suns come out of a valley.

541
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,620
Bright moonlight looking for a mythical tree."

542
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,070
All right, stop it.

543
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,750
I know you're good with poetry.

544
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,310
I'm not reciting a poem.

545
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,380
I'm just complimenting you.

546
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,750
How could a crown prince

547
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,100
get drunk with just a bottle of liquor?

548
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,510
I don't believe it.

549
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,950
Here. Have another one.

550
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,310
I knew it.

551
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,750
How dare he pretend to be drunk.

552
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,100
His Majesty

553
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,510
has taught me since I was young

554
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,620
to restrain myself, follow social norms,

555
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,510
and behave myself.

556
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,990
Trying to lecture me even when you're drunk?

557
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,470
Don't even think about it.

558
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,990
