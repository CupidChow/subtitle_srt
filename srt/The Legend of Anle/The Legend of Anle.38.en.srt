558
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,070
Luo Mingxi,

559
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,710
as usual,

560
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,400
you are the better player.

561
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,000
You learned humility.

562
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,360
That's not the Han Ye I knew.

563
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,550
People change.

564
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,110
Even the sharp-tongued Official Luo

565
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,590
would help me solve this puzzle now.

566
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,400
I don't want you

567
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,840
to get stuck.

568
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,840
Speaking of which, I haven't offered
my congratulations to you and Ziyuan.

569
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,000
She is supposed to be the Crown Princess.

570
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,070
You would really let me marry her?

571
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Well,

572
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,360
I almost forgot about that.

573
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,320
But you remember.

574
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,030
Of course, I do.

575
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,190
All the planning started

576
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,390
because you claimed

577
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,710
that you would only marry Di Ziyuan.

578
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,190
Only by doing that

579
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,630
that I could make a scene

580
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,030
and get off to a good start.

581
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,480
So you went after me.

582
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,840
What I didn't expect

583
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,190
was that Ziyuan is dead loyal to you.

584
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,320
And I was worried

585
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,910
that you would

586
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,360
do something to retaliate.

587
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,190
You didn't expect me

588
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,400
to endure everything.

589
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,880
Well, yes.

590
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,030
Who knew the ever-polite,

591
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,960
ever-composed Crown Prince

592
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,480
would fall in love with a pirate named Ren Anle?

593
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,400
If you put it that way,

594
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,710
what a journey, isn't it?

595
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,320
Indeed.

596
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,190
Luo Mingxi.

597
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,320
Please take care of yourself.

598
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,030
You need to look after Ziyuan.

599
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,800
Don't worry about it.

600
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,360
It's an old friend of mine.

601
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,440
Besides, surely I can look after her better

602
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,440
than the Crown Prince does.

603
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,360
Trying to one-up a blind man, huh?

604
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,840
You're ridiculous.

605
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,630
Let's call it a day here.

606
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,480
If you have made up your mind,

607
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,110
come and attend our wedding.

608
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,630
No thanks.

609
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,110
May you have a happy marriage.

610
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,200
[Ren's Residence]

611
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,630
Why are you sighing?

612
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,840
Young Lady,

613
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,550
I've been thinking.

614
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,320
His Highness is stubborn.

615
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,360
He hardly changes his mind.

616
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,630
What will you do if he won't show up

617
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,920
on that day?

618
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,830
Have you forgotten

619
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,990
that other than Di Ziyuan,

620
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,960
I am also the pirate, Ren Anle?

621
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,230
If he won't come,

622
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,070
I'll just kidnap him.

623
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,710
Young Lady.

624
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,830
The head of the Di family

625
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
found the Flower of Longing.

626
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:02,800
