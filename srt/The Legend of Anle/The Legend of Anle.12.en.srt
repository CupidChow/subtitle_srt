We can finally get out of the mountain.

We have lived in poor for ten years.

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,340
Except for the things sent by the Crown Prince,

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,780
there is nothing to bring down the mountain.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,660
The Crown Prince only sent me

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,460
some ancient books and classics.

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,140
The most important thing that I must bring

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,180
is you.

34
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,100

What are you saying?

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,420
His Majesty personally issued an edict

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,740
to welcome me back to the capital.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,420
That was not the only order in His Majesty's edict.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,740
His Majesty's edict stated

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,220
you may leave the mountain and enter the capital
due to his grace.

42
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,780
From today onward,

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,980
you shall be renamed Cheng'en.

So what?

45
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,420
Since it is the grace of the Emperor,

46
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,220

Di Ziyuan is a name
given by the Founding Emperor.

Because of this name, she enjoyed fame,

The Di family was annihilated

59
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,620
and will never accept the Emperor's grace.

60

Even if everyone in the Di family is dead,

61
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,100
what does it have to do with me?

62
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,820
Rebels must be annihilated.

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,340
Di Ziyuan should have been executed with them
ten years ago.

64
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,700
It was thanks to the great grace of the Emperor

65
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,980
that she got to live for another ten years.

67

I was eight years old that year.

Di Ziyuan was a privileged girl
before the age of eight

74
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,820
I thought a proper meal

75
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,860
was the most precious thing in the world.

76
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,540
I never knew

77
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,700

on Dai Mountain for ten years.

you only said that because this is

Please withdraw your edict.

185
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,260
For the sake of a sinner,

186
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,620
you are willing to beg me.

187
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,260
How great of a daughter you are.

188
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,970
[Residence of Marquis Jing'an]

189
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,620
Soon, she will be the new owner here.

190
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,380
She doesn't live here.

191
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,260
Han Zhongyuan summoned me to the palace today

192
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,900
and praised me for handling
the metropolitan examination cheating case well.

193
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,860
He rewarded me

194
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,020
to turn this place into a prison.

195
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,620
This Han Zhongyuan

196
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,620
is very thoughtful.

197
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,620
Changing your name to Cheng'en
is the first humiliation.

198
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
Turning the Residence of Marquis Jing'an
into a prison

199
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,620
is the second humiliation.

200
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,100
Han Zhongyuan

201
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,980
is truly a vengeful person.

202
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,620
What a coincidence.

203
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,140
I am also a vengeful person.

204
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,580
The reason I'm here tonight

205
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,260
is to remind myself

206
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,660
not to forget the blood feud back then.

207
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,900
I will come even if you don't let me.

208
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,380
Ziyuan.

209
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,660
When I was a child,
I fell into the water over here.

210
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,460
You saved my life.

211
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,140
But fate has its own plan.

212
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,020
The water in the pond is almost dry now.

213
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:23,900
And you

214
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,260
have even changed your name.

215
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,860
You have to change your name to Cheng'en.

216
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,260
And this place is going to be a prison.

217
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,260
The Han family doesn't spare the Di family at all.

218
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,580
Why would these two families
have such a deep vendetta?

219
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,020
I feel shame to pay my respect

220
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,500
to every plant, tree, tile, or stone

221
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,780
in this Residence of Marquis Jing'an.

222
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,380
But I'm afraid I'll die on the battlefield

223
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,140
and forget these nightmarish memories.

224
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,780
Anning.

225
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,740
Ye.

226
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,460
Anning.

227
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,460
Don't disobey His Majesty anymore.

228
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,020
If His Majesty is angry,

229
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,660
you'll get hurt.

230
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,660
The Di family was exterminated

231
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,580
right here in the Residence of Marquis Jing'an.

232
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,380
Ziyuan witnessed all of this.

233
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,020
I dare not think about it,

234
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,780
but I have no choice.

235
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,260
I had to get drunk every time before I came here

236
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,620
to pretend that this was a dream.

237
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,260
I know.

238
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,780
I remember

239
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,500
you were a brave general in the Northwest.

240
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,100
After you returned to the capital,
you were drinking every day

241
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,620
like there was no tomorrow.

242
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,500
You don't have to do this.

243
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,500
I come here

244
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
to remind myself not to forget

245
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,060
Ziyuan has saved me in this pond

246
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,780
back then.

247
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,180
With that kind of personality,

248
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,700
Ziyuan will not become Di Cheng'en so easily.

249
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,540
Maybe.

250
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,180
But we will never know how it felt
when being imprisoned

251
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,820
for ten years in Dai Mountain.

252
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,700
I'd rather she stay in Dai Mountain.

253
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,940
At least the Jing State will be peaceful.

254
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,820
And Ziyuan will be safe.

255
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,060
Anning.

256
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,540
After Ziyuan came down from the mountain,

257
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,180
I'll do my best

258
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,060
to fulfill my promise.

259
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,300
Who is here?

260
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,540
Ren Anle?

261
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,020
Your Highness is looking for me,

262
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,180
that's why I'm here.

263
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,020
Why are you here alone?

264
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,180
Who says I'm alone?

265
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,180
Come here.

266
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Luo Mingxi?

267
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,180
What are you two doing here

268
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,300
in the middle of the night?

269
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,300
In the middle of the night,
under the moon and flowers.

270
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,540
What else can a man and a woman do?

271
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,620
We are naturally here
to talk about official business.

272
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,820
Official business?

273
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,300
Is the Court of Judicial Review not good enough?

274
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
How come you two have to talk business here?

275
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,900
Your Highness, Residence of Marquis Jing'an

276
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,540
is about to turn into a prison.

277
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,820
So, I came in advance to see

278
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,060
which spot is suitable
to put the torture equipment.

279
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,700
Ren Anle.

280
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
Why wasn't I aware

281
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,100
that you care about the torture equipment?

282
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,300
Since Your Highness has figured it out,

283
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,700
I'll be honest, then.

284
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,260
Actually,

285
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,940
I came here

286
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,700
because of Di Ziyuan.

287
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,060
This is the famous Residence of Marquis Jing'an.

288
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,660
It's where Di Ziyuan lived before.

289
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,540
Yuanqin told me

290
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,700
that one must know the enemy and oneself
to win every battle.

291
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,780
So, I wanted to come and have a look.

292
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,540
Who is this Di Ziyuan?

293
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,180
Why are you so fixated on her?

294
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,780
Both of you

295
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
have never told me about Di Ziyuan.

296
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,380
So, I recalled

297
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,900
Your Highness has told me

298
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,180
the person who cares

299
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,900
about Di Ziyuan in this capital

300
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
is Luo Mingxi.

301
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,820
This time,

302
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,620
I have told Luo Mingxi all
the mechanisms and torture tools

303
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,180
in Anle Abode's water prison.

304
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,260
If it weren't because

305
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,380
Di Ziyuan is coming down soon,

306
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,940
I'm sure I can get a better deal.

307
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,180
Anle.

308
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,940
If you want to know about Ziyuan,

309
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,060
just come and ask me.

310
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I have bet a lot of money on you
to become the Crown Princess.

311
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,020
How can I not help you?

312
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
You should have told me sooner.

313
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,180
Ren Anle.

314
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,540
I don't care why you're here.

315
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,820
But don't come near this place again.

316
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,740
If someone with bad intentions makes use of this,

317
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

318
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,220
Great then.

319
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,260
The two persons in the capital
who know Di Ziyuan the best

320
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,900
are here.

321
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,140
Ask them.

322
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm leaving now.

323
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,580
You have received my gift.

324
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,740
How could you leave first?

325
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,380
Look, the moon is so round.

326
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,460
It's the best time to drink together.

327
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,700
Let's go, Anning.

328
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,180
Okay.

329
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,660
Let's go.

330
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,740
Let's go for a drink.

331
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,950
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

332
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,620
Cheers.

333
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,380
Let's have another drink.

334
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,620
Ziyuan is straightforward.

335
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
She's very similar to you.

336
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,900
If there is a chance,

337
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,860
I'm sure you will be good friends.

338
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,140
If she sees me being so loving

339
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,900
and close to His Highness,

340
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
won't she be jealous?

341
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,420
We are in the same boat
and treating each other sincerely. Nothing more.

342
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,260
Is it because I seized Your Highness's book,

343
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,420
that's why Your Highness
is still holding grudges?

344
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,700
You know that is not

345
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,100
some ordinary book.

346
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,100
Your Highness gets Di Ziyuan.

347
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,260
I only get a book.

348
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,180
It's my loss.

349
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,180
Let me.

350
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,700
Thank you, Official Luo.

351
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,620
Since there are wine and food,

352
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,740
why don't we play some games to have fun?

353
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,620
-What game?
-Sure.

354
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,380
Since we are treating each other with sincerity,

355
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,260
when Miss Linlang stops playing the guqin,

356
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,740
the one holding onto this flower

357
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,260
has to answer a question honestly.

358
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,980
If you don't answer,

359
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,420
you have to drink, okay?

360
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:35,900
No.

361
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,460
Why not?

362
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,980
Don't drink if you can't.

363
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,100
That's right. Let's get started.

364
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,740
Start the game.

365
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,380
Linlang.

366
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,740
I'm giving it back to you.

367
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,380
It's you.

368
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Ye.

369
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,380
Your Highness.

370
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,380
I knew you would be the unlucky one.

371
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,380
Your Highness, I have a question for you.

372
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,460
Di Ziyuan's family has been annihilated,

373
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,380
why do you still insist on marrying her
as the Crown Princess?

374
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,980
I know the answer.

375
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,260
I'll say it for him.

376
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,980
Before the Jing State was founded,

377
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,700
the head of the Di family, Di Shengtian,

378
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,140
handed over half of the country.

379
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,420
To consolidate the alliance
between the Han and Di families,

380
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,620
the Founding Emperor listed Ziyuan

381
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,140
as the Crown Princess in the succession edict.

382
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,180
-Come on.
-Let's continue.

383
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,700
Keep it going.

384
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,380
Continue.

385
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,100
Quick.

386
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,980
Your Highness.

387
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,380
It's you again, Your Highness.

388
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,860
Then I'll ask you again.

389
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,740
Since you insist on marrying Di Ziyuan,

390
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,620
the first reason must be the will
of the Founding Emperor, isn't it?

391
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,380
And the second reason must be that you want to

392
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,620
repay the Di family's kindness
on behalf of the Han family.

393
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,220
Your Highness.

394
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,380
Your Highness, you must not drink.

395
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,180
Your Highness.

396
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,980
My brother can't hold his liquor.

397
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,500
I'll drink for him.

398
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,180
Continue.

399
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,620
Quick.

400
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,100
Continue.

401
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,100
Let's start.

402
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,620
Hand it to me.

403
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,100
Your Highness.

404
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,700
It's finally your turn.

405
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,540
-Who is asking the question?
-Me, me, me!

406
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,980
Anning.

407
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,740
Why do you not want Di Ziyuan
to leave the mountain?

408
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,740
Everyone in this world knows

409
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,380
the Di family was kind to the Han family,

410
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,980
but they don't know

411
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,740
the Han family is indebted to the Di family.

412
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,980
Anning.

413
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,500
Your Highness.

414
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,260
The general has been depressed for a long time.

415
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Please let her vent.

416
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,500
Anle, you don't know, right?

417
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,700
The Han and Di families had a bet back then.

418
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,180
The troops that arrived in Dibei City first

419
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,260
would be the Emperor.

420
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,740
Can you guess

421
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,620
who arrived first?

422
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,740
It's the Di family.

423
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,740
The Di family had won the bet.

424
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,720
But they still handed over the country
to the Han family.

425
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,140
So,

426
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,260
how could the Di family plot a rebellion?

427
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,700
But our emperor...

428
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,100
Our emperor acted arbitrarily.

429
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,260
He executed all the 80,000 Di Troops

430
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,180
and the entire Di family.

431
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,940
Anning, enough!

432
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,180
Such a bloody and tearful past.

433
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,460
It seems like Your Highness

434
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,380
will never forget Di Ziyuan
for the rest of your life.

435
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,700
After all, she is the only one left in the Di family.

436
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,780
She is also the only hope

437
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,620
to resolve the vendetta
between the Di and Han families.

438
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,500
But, Your Highness,

439
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
have you ever thought

440
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,380
that after so many years,

441
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,420
maybe Di Ziyuan is no longer

442
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
who she used to be.

443
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,900
She might have another plan

444
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,220
to come back to the capital.

445
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,860
Di Ziyuan is the most carefree woman

446
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,380
I have ever seen in the capital.

447
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,260
Even if she has changed her name,

448
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,740
there will be people who remember her.

449
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,260
So what?

450
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,660
I, Ren Anle,

451
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,220
am also a rare woman in this world.

452
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:20,980
Let's play again.

453
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,900
Come on.

454
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,380
Wait a minute, Ren Anle.

455
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,140
You have been the one to start the game.

456
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,220
Isn't that unfair?

457
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
You can start it then.

458
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
Your Highness.

459
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,180
Official Luo.

460
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,700
Luo Mingxi.

461
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,140
Please call me Official Luo.

462
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,260
Official Luo.

463
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,740
Fire away.

464
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
Why did you always show up

465
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,260
at Lingxiang Pleasure House with Ren Anle?

466
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,980
Yes.

467
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,540
I know.

468
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,940
Official Luo

469
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,940
may look cold and ruthless.

470
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,260
But in his heart, he keeps thinking about...

471
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,220
He keeps thinking about...

472
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,180
Linlang!

473
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,420
Official Luo, am I right?

474
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,180
No wonder.

475
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,140
It's very hard to invite Miss Linlang over.

476
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,780
It turns out that she is taken.

477
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,900
Official Luo.

478
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,740
So, you like Linlang?

479
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,180
I can ask His Majesty to arrange your marriage.

480
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,020
Your Highness,
please don't worry about my marriage.

481
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,140
Hurry up and choose your Crown Princess.

482
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,780
Oh, right.

483
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,740
Miss Linlang.

484
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,780
I'm keeping these few jars of liquor here.

485
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,700
For the sake of Official Luo's marriage,

486
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,420
we will come often in the future.

487
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,620
Young Lady, the Han family

488
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,540
didn't feel ashamed to drink with you?

489
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,660
When I think about the name Cheng'en...

490
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,420
Enough.

491
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,980
It was hard for them to accept

492
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,780
the fact that Di Ziyuan changed her name
to leave the mountain.

493
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,700
It's good.

494
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,180
Di Cheng'en

495
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,740
is the first name that truly belongs to her.

496
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,020
Young Lady.

497
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,420
You seem to sympathize with the girl
on Dai Mountain too much.

498
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,900
Although Anle Abode is shabby,

499
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,500
everyone cherishes me.

500
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
I wonder what it's like
to be imprisoned for ten years.

501
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,220
But if she comes to the capital, then you...

502
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
Don't worry.

503
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
All she ever wants is a stable life.

504
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,180
It's a pity that her life in the capital

505
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,740
might be unstable as well.

506
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,740
I'm more worried about you two.

507
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,340
You will definitely meet her in the future.

508
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,940
Just remember not to give the game away

509
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,940
and don't treat her lightheartedly.

510
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,540
-That's for sure.
-Yes.

511
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,180
[Residence of the Princess]

512
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,940
Ziyuan taught me this sword technique.

513
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,700
I was practicing her sword technique

514
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,980
and drinking her favorite liquor.

515
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,780
She is entering the capital tomorrow.

516
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,380
But I dare not meet her.

517
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,540
I am such a coward.

518
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,940
Actually, I'm not afraid that she is coming back.

519
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,140
I'm afraid that I won't

520
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,460
be able to let go of the guilt in my heart
when I see her.

521
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,420
You were born into an imperial family.

522
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,980
There are many things
that are beyond your control.

523
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,420
I can understand.

524
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,540
I believe Miss Di will understand too.

525
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,540
(Can Ziyuan really understand me?)

526
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,140
(Is it true that she doesn't hate me?)

527
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,900
What a heavy rain.

528
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,780
Your Highness.

529
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,780
Do you want to take a look at my homework?

530
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,260
Just leave it here.

531
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,740
I heard

532
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,660
if everything goes well,

533
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,660
Miss Di will arrive in the capital tomorrow.

534
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,740
Is Your Highness worried
about her traveling in the rain at night?

535
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,700
(No!)

536
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,020
(Despite the favorable conditions,)

537
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,220
(her situation might end up otherwise.)

538
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,020
(Ziyuan.)

539
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,740
(What kind of turbulence)

540
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,100
(is awaiting you when you arrive)

541
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,140
(in the capital?)

542
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,100
How nice the scenery of suburbia is.

543
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,820
I heard

544
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,380
there are geese chirping every night
in the northwest desert.

545
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
In the canal towns,

546
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,540
boat songs are heard in the early morning.

547
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,660
The capital is even more bustling and lively.

548
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,180
I heard there are fireworks at every festival.

549
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,420
The sound of fireworks explosion
is even more beautiful.

550

00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,220
I was born to die for the Luo family.

737
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,740
When you went up the mountain,

738
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,980
how old were you, and what was your task?

739
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,140
I was 16 years old when I went up to Dai Mountain.

740
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,420
I was sent up to Dai Mountain
to protect the young lady.

741
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,140
To monitor her.

742
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,460
Yes, to monitor the young lady.

743
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,540
I dare not forget my duty.

744
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,860
When a person is 16 years old,

745
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,900
he might experience a new and tender
emotion for someone else for the first time.

746
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,100
That is not true.

747
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,140
I only have the Luo family in my heart.

748
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,180
You have been serving me since you were a child.

749
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,380
I know you are mature and reliable,

750
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,620
but she holds much significance.

751
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,620
If she makes a mistake
and affects our overall plan,

752
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,740
I'd have no choice but to kill her.

753
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,140
I have always taken your orders to heart.

754
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,580
Her demeanor today

755
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,900
almost resembles Miss Di's.

756
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,660
Then, did you know

757
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,060
that she laid a wrong weiqi piece today?
