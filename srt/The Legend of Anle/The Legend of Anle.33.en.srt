[The Legend of Anle]
[Adapted from a novel by Xing Ling]

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
[Episode 33]

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,960
Fortunately,

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,080
you only sustained a few scratches,
Your Highness.

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,200
If it cut any deeper,

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,360
it

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,320
would take a week or two to heal.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,800
Wen Shuo,

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,880
on the battlefield, don't treat me
like the Crown Prince.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,120
We are soldiers.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,720
It is our duty to fight
till we draw the last breath.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,160
We decided to come here,

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,720
so we shouldn't let a minor injury get in our way.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
All right.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,040
I will be like you

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
and Anle.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,120
I'll become a dauntless warrior.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,240
Give others the ointment.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,120
A lot of them are injured

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
and they might not have enough ointment.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,920
It's done, Young Lady.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
Most of us here are injured too.

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,360
Young Lady,

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,480
Yuanshu and I will see to it now.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,680
Come on.

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,120
Check the casualties over there.

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
Bring water and food ration with you too.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,360
So you want to check on Anle, Your Highness.

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,720
Why don't you go there yourself?

52
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,480
My hand is injured.

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm indisposed.

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,120
I wonder who told me just now

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,800
that we shouldn't let a minor injury
get in our way.

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,480
Just go.

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,680
Fine.

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,440
Yuanqin.

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,800
Wen Shuo.

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,600
It's been a while.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
I have so many things to tell you.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,800
Your Highness,

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,880
Young Lady asked me to come here to check on you.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,680
I am well.

65
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,920
But you,
who fought the Northern Qin army for a night,

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,600
must have sustained heavy casualties.

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,040
Your Highness.

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,360
I have many things to tell Yuanqin.

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,920
If you want to check on Anle,

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,120
please do it yourself.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,560
Let's go.

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,240
You're drinking, Official Di.

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,480
What if you're too stupefied
to give commands later?

74
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,480
Drink the strongest liquor
before I kill the fiercest enemy.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,040
That's what I call living.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,320
Do you want a sip, Your Highness?

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,360
Right.

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,440
You can't hold your liquor.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
One sip is enough to get you drunk.

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
And you'll start confessing to everyone.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,040
The consequences may be dire
if you reveal our military intel

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
to the Northern Qin.

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,560
I am the Crown Prince of Jing.

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,600
I will never sell my nation out.

85
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,880
As to whether or not I will confess to everyone,

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
that depends.

87
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,000
Ziyuan.

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
Thank you for looking past old grudges

89
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,480
and for joining me in this war.

90
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,600
Our feud aside,

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,240
we live in the same nation.

92
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,680
Yuanqin.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,560
There is a war out there.

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
You have to be careful.

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
Don't get hurt.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,920
And don't be afraid.

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
I'll protect you.

98
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,240
I can't fight,

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
and I am not deployed on the battlefield.

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,240
All I can do

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,240
is dress your wounds

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,440
and deliver the food supply.

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,920
We need a full tummy to win the war.

104
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,360
Your contribution is essential.

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
The bread is cooked.

106
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,040
I'll give it to Young Lady.

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Just eat it here.

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,120
Anle and His Highness
finally had the chance to talk.

109
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
Don't disturb them.

110
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Stay here.

111
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,440
Okay.

112
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,040
They finally overcame the differences
between them.

113
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,160
After Anle resumed her identity as Di Ziyuan,

114
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,120
they somehow became strangers.

115
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,560
His Highness and Young Lady
care about the people.

116
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
And they will fight for them.

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,920
Perhaps they can only live as Ren Anle and Han Ye

118
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,360
when they are far from the capital.

119
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,440
After I returned from Huayuan Mountain,

120
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,360
I thought there would only be two options for us.

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,240
Which are?

122
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,600
Either we become enemies

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
or we go our separate ways.

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,160
But fate gave us the third option.

125
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Ziyuan.

126
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm so glad that we can

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,600
fight together.

128
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,920
Official Luo.

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,880
Where is Official Di?

130
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
There are many nooks and crannies

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,040
in this canyon.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
Search everywhere now.

133
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,120
Find me Official Di and her army.

134
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,160
Yes, sir.

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,040
How did you know I'd be here?

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,160
I intercepted an intel
from the Northern Qin Army,

137
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,800
so I was aware
that they set up an ambush in the canyon.

138
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
But we obtained the movements

139
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,880
of Northern Qin first.

140
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,000
Something is off with the intel.

141
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,920
Releasing false information

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
to lure me into coming here...

143
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,920
Ziyuan.

144
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,480
Luo Mingxi.

145
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Why are you here too?

146
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,440
I intercepted an intel.

147
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,680
Are you all right?

148
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
You too?

149
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Yes.

150
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,360
I came because of that intel too.

151
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,000
But less than 1,000 enemies were found here.

152
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,800
Oh, no.

153
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
It's a red herring.

154
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,870
[Half a day ago]

155
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
(I)

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,240
(will lead my army.)

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,160
[Qingnan City]
(I will be the bait)

158
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,640
(to lure the Northern Qin Army into the trap.)

159
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,440
(They boast a greater number,)

160
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
(but we have the geographical advantage.)

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
(Once I draw their attention,)

162
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,760
(you'll activate the traps)

163
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
(and catch them by surprise.)

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,280
(We disrupt their tempo.)

165
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,760
(Then, we rain a thousand arrows
to pierce their armor.)

166
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,120
(I will make them chase me
around the city thrice to exhaust them.)

167
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,600
(While you take advantage of the situation
to reduce their elite forces.)

168
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,920
(That way,)

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,800
(we can outwit them)

170
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,120
(and defend Qingnan.)

171
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,440
(We are not aiming for a victory.)

172
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
(We just need to buy enough time)

173
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,040
(till our reinforcements arrive.)

174
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,440
(My comrades in Qingnan,)

175
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,560
(we have someone to protect)

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
(and a city to defend.)

177
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,200
(The Northern Qin Army cannot kill us.)

178
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,720
Bring it on!

179
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,960
Come on!

180
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
You think you can kill me?

181
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,040
Charge!

182
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,280
Charge!

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,920
Charge!

184
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,640
General Anning.

185
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,680
Resist no further.

186
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,400
Surrender now

187
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
and you may be spared.

188
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
To die on a battlefield

189
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,120
is an honor.

190
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I refuse to be a coward

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,760
and surrender to my enemy!

192
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,920
My spear will decide

193
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,560
who lives or dies today.

194
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,280
In that case,

195
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
I shall grant your wish.

196
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,560
Kill her!

197
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,560
Halt!

198
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,360
Halt!

199
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,640
Halt immediately!

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,560
She is the commander-in-chief of Jing.

201
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,840
We capture her alive.

202
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,280
Now only you show your face.

203
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,840
Mo Bei.

204
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,480
Have you no shame?

205
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,000
Anning.

206
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,760
Drop your weapon now.

207
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,040
If you surrender,

208
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,280
I can guarantee

209
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,360
that you'll keep your position.

210
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I will not allow you

211
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,120
to use me to humiliate my nation.

212
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,920
Anning.

213
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm warning you now.

214
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,800
Choose your battles wisely.

215
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,360
Unlike the Jing State,

216
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,480
we don't pardon those who won't surrender.

217
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,140
Instead, we will conquer with force.

218
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,700
Shame on you.

219
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,660
How else are we supposed

220
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,500
to bring Jing to its knees?

221
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
The Jing State has millions of brave souls.

222
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,620
You can never make us surrender!

223
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,780
Princess Anning!

224
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,540
I'm asking you one last time.

225
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,260
Will you surrender or not?

226
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,780
Surrender?

227
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,780
Even when I die,

228
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,940
I will not bow down to you.

229
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,580
Careful, sir!

230
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,980
Shoot!

231
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,580
No!

232
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
(Is it over?)

233
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,500
(Is this the end?)

234
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,260
(If I hadn't headed to Jingxin Hall that night,)

235
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,300
(I wouldn't have learned the truth.)

236
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,860
(I wouldn't have felt guilty)

237
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,820
(and stayed in the Northwest.)

238
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,380
(I wouldn't have met Lengbei,)

239
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,260
(and I wouldn't have lost Qingnan City.)

240
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,220
(Alas, my life)

241
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,580
(wasn't what Father had hoped for me,)

242
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,740
(a life of peace and longevity.)

243
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,700
Your Highness.

244
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,740
Your Highness.

245
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,980
We lost Qingnan City.

246
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,220
General Anning had fallen.

247
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,580
What?

248
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,860
The Northern Qin invaded all of a sudden.

249
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,900
General Anning defended the city

250
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,300
till the very end

251
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,860
and never conceded.

252
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,100
Your Highness,

253
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,220
she was waiting for reinforcements
as she drew her last breath.

254
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,660
Bai Zheng.

255
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
You're telling me

256
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,260
that the Northern Qin Army attacked yesterday?

257
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,940
Anning could have evacuated her men

258
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,940
out of Qingnan City.

259
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,700
Why did she stay?

260
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,260
Your Highness,

261
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,780
General Anning thought her defense

262
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,820
could create an opportunity for us to retaliate.

263
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,220
Luo Mingxi.

264
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,260
You were given the imperial order
to bring reinforcements to Qingnan City.

265
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,940
Why are you here?

266
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,220
I made a mistake.

267
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,780
Your Highness,

268
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,420
may I say something?

269
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Go ahead.

270
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,220
We were close to Qingnan City,

271
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,100
but Official Luo here demanded us

272
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,260
to reroute.

273
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,900
Your Highness.

274
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,260
General Anning died in vain.

275
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,540
Please right the wrong!

276
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,420
Please right the wrong, Your Highness.

277
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,540
Luo Mingxi.

278
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,460
How dare you!

279
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,700
You misappropriated our army

280
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,300
for your personal agenda!

281
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,420
Anning is dead.

283
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,060
Qingnan City has fallen.

284
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,020
Your apology holds no weight.

285
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,940
It's an irony!

286
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,820
Luo Mingxi should be beheaded

287
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,300
to rest General Anning's soul.

288
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,420
Luo Mingxi should be beheaded

289
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,940
to rest General Anning's soul.

290
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,300
Luo Mingxi should be beheaded

291
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,020
to rest General Anning's soul.

292
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,820
Luo Mingxi.

293
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,420
Your selfish command has made you lose
the golden opportunity to help a general in need.

294
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,460
She died as a result

295
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
and Qingnan City was claimed.

296
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,660
By martial law,

297
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,540
you ought to be beheaded.

298
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,460
Take him away.

299
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,140
Find a day to execute him.

300
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,540
Your Highness.

301
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,380
Your Highness.

302
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,780
Can I say something for Luo Mingxi?

303
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,180
Your Highness.

304
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,140
We need people right now.

305
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,820
If we kill Luo Mingxi,

306
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,180
who can be our tactician?

307
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,460
We lost an experienced city defender

308
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,900
and an important military pass of Jing.

309
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,660
Ziyuan.

310
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,940
You know very well the gravity of his crime.

311
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,540
Only his death

312
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,540
can restore the army's morale.

313
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,180
Yes, he made a huge mistake.

314
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,820
The false information led him to a bad decision.

315
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,020
And he

316
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,940
must be guilt-ridden by Anning's death.

317
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,180
That's why

318
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,460
I hope you can

319
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,260
give him another chance

320
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,020
to make up for his mistake.

321
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,100
How can he atone for Anning's death?

322
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,660
Anning is already dead.

323
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,300
I cannot let Luo Mingxi die as well.

324
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,660
If his death is what you want,

325
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,420
then take my life instead.

326
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,300
Ziyuan.

327
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,420
No one can serve the punishment in his stead.

328
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,660
Thousands of men have died in this war.

329
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,300
Many cities are in a shambles.

330
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,060
They all fought for Jing

331
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,260
and their deaths shouldn't be in vain.

332
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,300
If the army's morale is low,

333
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,020
we won't be able to reclaim Qingnan City.

334
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,780
The Northern Qin will have swift access

335
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,940
to the Jing State.

336
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,180
Our people are in danger.

337
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,660
Other than killing Luo Mingxi,

338
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,820
what else can I do?

339
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,780
Ziyuan.

340
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,060
You hold Luo Mingxi dearly.

341
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Do you think he means nothing to me?

342
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,780
I already lost a sister.

343
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,820
Do you think I want to lose a good friend?

344
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,260
I am Anning's brother,

345
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,660
Luo Mingxi's friend,

346
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,580
the Crown Prince of Jing,
and the commander of an army.

347
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,540
The decision to kill him

348
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,940
is tough to make. But I did it.

349
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,820
Your Highness, Official Di.

350
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,460
Before General Anning fought in the war,

351
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,260
she said that if she...

352
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,180
It's a letter she told me

353
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,180
to deliver to Official Di

354
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,420
and Your Highness.

355
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,580
(Ziyuan, Ye.)

356
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,580
(May this letter find you well.)

357
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
(If you're reading this,)

358
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,620

361
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,620
(In the past, I passed by Qingnan several times,)

362
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,740

364

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,860
(there was a barren land that housed
the souls of 80,000 men who died for nothing.)

366
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,870
♪I'd go the distance for you,

Anle.

369
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,860
Anning.

370
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,860
(In each other we found a confidant.)

371
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,420
So today, we complete this ritual

I should be the one apologizing.

470
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,020
Han Ye shouldn't pardon me anyway.

471
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,460
No.

477

Only my death can console the army.

478

I won't let Han Ye kill you.

484

Han Ye doesn't want to kill me.

485
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,460
The soldiers do.

486
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,700

You once told me
that as a descendant of the Di family,

489
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,620
I should have the bravado to turn the tides
like the head of the Di family did.

490

(I know Luo Mingxi's crime
is punishable by death.)

501
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,220
(I will reclaim Qingnan City
even if I have to risk my own life.)

502
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,620
(I hope this is enough to persuade you
to spare him.)

503
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,980

Yes, Your Highness.

506
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,620
Assemble the army.
We are reclaiming Qingnan City.

507
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,860
What is the meaning of this?

508
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,580
Your Highness,

509
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,860
everyone is still mad
about the death of General Anning.

510

If Luo Mingxi is not executed,

511
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,460
how can we convince others to follow us

512
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,820

513
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,460
I'm afraid I cannot comply.

514
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,340
You refuse to comply.

515
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,180
You put yourself above the current emergency.

516
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,940

517
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,580
why you wield your sword

518
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,580
and why you don your armor?

519

You are all part of the Jing State.

520
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,340
Now that a calamity befell us,

521
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,980
you want to stay here and do nothing?

522
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,060
Your home, my home,

523
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,340
they are being ravaged

524
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,940
as we speak.

525
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,100
If we don't reclaim Qingnan City,

526
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,220
the Northern Qin will come charging straight
sooner or later.

527
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,260
And when that happens, peace will be a luxury.

528
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,700
How many soldiers and citizens

529
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,500

530
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,060
How many families

531
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,220
will be torn apart?

532
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,500
I know

533
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,380
you're mad because Anning and her men died

534
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,180
in a tragedy that could be averted.

535
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,540
But they fought till the end.

536
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,300
For what? For our land.

537
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,620
For our sovereignty.

538
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,300
For the lives of innocent people.

539
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,180
By reclaiming Qingnan,

540
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,300
we bring solace to our fallen brothers.

541
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,220
I am the Crown Prince of Jing,

542
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
Anning's brother,

543
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,180
and more importantly, your compatriot.

544
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,140
Does anyone here

545
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,700
want to join me

546
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,380
as we deliver

547
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,140
people from suffering,

548
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,900
as we defend the Jing State?

549
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,820
I will follow you, Your Highness.

550
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,060
I want to fulfill General Anning's last wish.

551
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:18,420
I will follow you, Your Highness.

552
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
After this battle,

553
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,660
I will deal with Luo Mingxi's crime

554
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,180
and give all of you a satisfactory answer.

555
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,100
Wen Shuo, why are you here?

556
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,500
I sneaked here.

557
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,420
I didn't tell His Highness.

558
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,140
Wen Shuo.

559
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,620
Tell me the truth now.

560
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
Why did you follow us?

561
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,300
Anle, I was worried about you all.

562
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,660
I serve the Jing State,

563
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,900
so protecting our land is also my duty.

564
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,220
How selfless of you.

565
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,900
That's the Wen Shuo I know.

566
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,420
Mr. Wen, I heard

567
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,900
you studied a great many military literature
with His Highness when you were little.

568
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,620
I'm sure you're acquainted with warfare.

569
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,500
According to Bai Zheng,

570
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,300
General Anning evacuated

571
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,820
the city's supplies before the battle.

572
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,700
Qingnan City has no food

573
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,100
and the Northern Qin Army just claimed the city.

574
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,740
They won't have enough time to rest up,

575
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,740
so they remain weakened.

576
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,460
Perhaps this is our opportunity

577
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,020
to retaliate.

578
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,140
Han Ye taught you well.

579
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,700
If Jinyan was still alive,

580
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,380
I bet he would just be as smart as you.

581
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,860
Let's go.

582
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,420
Okay.

583
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,500
Let's go.

584
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,140
Charge!

585
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,900
Charge!

586
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,540
(The Northern Qin Army has let their guard down.)

587
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,660
(We will scale the rampart with escalades)

588
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,300
(and create a ruckus.)

589
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,820
(That should draw the attention of our enemies.)

590
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,700
(And then, I'll head to where Mo Bei stays)

591
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,900
(and subdue him first, as he's the leader.)

592
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,420
(I will bring Anning back.)

593
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,300
(We will reclaim Qingnan.)

594
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,660
Lengbei.

595
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,420
Die!

596
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,580
Di Ziyuan.

597
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,420
You fight very well.

598
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,500
Hand over Anning's body.

599
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:13,900
Kill them.

600
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,860
Our enemies are in a shambles.

601
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,300
Shouldn't you

602
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,140
offer something in exchange?

603
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,580
I can't believe

604
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,900
you would exploit her
even when she's already dead.

605
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,740
Di Ziyuan!

606
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,380
Do you know?

607
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,660
While you sleep comfortably every night,

608
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,420
Anning would wake up often from her nightmare.

609
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,580
You forced her to betray her own grandmother,

610
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,340
to betray her own family.

611
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,100
Do you have any idea about the pain she felt?

612
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,900
She suffered

613
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,900
because of you.

614
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,140
Yet

615
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,140
you accuse me of using her?

616
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,140
If you did care about her,

617
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
you would

618
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,140
give us a few cities,

619
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,420
sign a peace treaty, and offer a sum

620
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,900
in exchange for her.

621
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,900
She deserves to rest in her home country.

622
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,620
Lengbei.

623
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,420
Enough is enough.

624
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,900
She wouldn't have wanted us
to relinquish any land.

625
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,420
Then pay with your life!

626
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,140
Eat this.

627
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,140
Anle.

628
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,060
Are you okay?

629
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,940
Catch him.

630
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,460
Han Ye.

631
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,860
Sorry.

632
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,620
I couldn't bring Anning back.

633
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,380
Sorry.

634
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,660
You did so well already.

635
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,580
You reclaimed Qingnan.

636
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,420
Ziyuan?

637
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,100
Ziyuan?

638
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,900
Ziyuan?
