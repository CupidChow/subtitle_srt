[The Legend of Anle]
[Adapted from a novel by Xing Ling]

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
[Episode 34]

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,100
How's Anle now?

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,180
It has been three days.

27
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,820
Young Lady is still unconscious.

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,820
Her injuries were too severe.

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,820
Now,

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,820
the Crown Prince is accompanying her.

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,140
Since His Highness is here,

32
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,460
I can come back later.

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,780
Young Lady is a good person.
She's bound to be blessed by heaven.

34
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,020
So don't be too worried.

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,260
All right.

36
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,740
Ziyuan,

37
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,460
are you really not willing to wake up?

38
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,740
Lately,

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,660
I keep recalling the time I first met you

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,660
ten years ago.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,820
I remember it was snowing heavily that day.

42
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,660
The entire palace was covered in ice and snow.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,740
I just came out of the imperial study
at that time.

44
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,500
You were clad in a fiery red coat,

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,380
protecting Anning who was behind you.

46
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,940
You were unbelievable.

47
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,740
A girl at the age of seven or eight like you

48
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,020
dared to reprimand the palace concubines
for lack of moral character

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,380
in the imperial palace of the royal family.

50
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,300
I am afraid there were no other noble ladies

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,020
in Jing State

52
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,380
that possesses a character like yours.

53
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
At that time, I thought,

54
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,500
"Grandfather

55
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,940
sure has found a remarkable wife for me."

56
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,780
But after that...

57
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,500
So many things happened after that.

58
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,660
Ziyuan,

59
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,500
the thing I'm most grateful for in my life

60
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,220
is Grandfather's decree of marriage.

61
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,060
You became my Di Ziyuan,

62
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,780
the Crown Princess of Jing, known by all.

63
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,780
In this life,

64
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,380
I have no regrets

65
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,620
because all I want in this world

66
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,340
is you, Di Ziyuan.

67
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,500
Luo Mingxi.

68
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,500
We may have different personalities.

69
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,060
But over the years,

70
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,900
I've learned

71
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,060
that you have a far-reaching vision beyond mine.

72
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,100
Your Highness,

73
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,060
there's no need for you to praise me now.

74
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
For the Di family

75
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,060
and Ziyuan,

76
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,700
you could steer your way
in the complicated court for a decade

77
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,500
and plan each step with precision.

78
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,620
How could you fall for his tricks this easily?

79
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,220
Lengbei's method

80
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,620
targeted people's hearts.

81
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,180
I was susceptible to it.

82
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,740
The person you were too trusting of
was not Lengbei,

83
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,620
but Anning.

84
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,420
Lengbei predicted accurately
that you and Anning

85
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,060
wouldn't put Ziyuan's life at stake.

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,860
Even if there was a chance of being deceived,

87
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,860
you'd spare no effort to protect her.

88
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,620
(Ziyuan was ambushed by Northern Qin.)

89
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,380
(Upon receiving this letter,)

90
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,180
(Luo Mingxi,)

91
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,980
(I request you to rush to Ziyuan's aid)

92
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,620
(so Qingnan City can still make
a last-ditch attempt.)

93
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,660
Luo Mingxi,

94
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,740
how could you not tell me a single word?

95
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
Are you really trying to force me
to personally kill you?

96
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,060
My life is now hanging by a thread.

97
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,300
My death is not a loss.

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,620
To avenge Anning's death

99
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,540
and appease the people's anger,

100
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,180
I ask that Your Highness grant me death.

101
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,180
Luo Mingxi,

102
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,940
this time,

103
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,740
even I can no longer protect you.

104
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
What you should protect

105
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,100
is the honor of Jing,

106
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,740
the safety of the borders,

107
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,540
and everything that Ziyuan will face
in the future.

108
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,220
Yuanqin...

109
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,540
Young Lady.

110
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,940
Young Lady, you're awake.

111
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,300
It's great.

112
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,500
Young Lady,

113
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,620
it's great.

114
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,940
You're finally awake.

115
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,860
You've been unconscious for three days.

116
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,740
Thank you for taking care of me.

117
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,820
Young Lady,

118
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,940
how are you feeling now?

119
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,540
Young Lady,

120
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,940
you're finally awake.

121
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,380
If you remain unconscious,

122
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,220
I'm afraid His Highness won't last long either.

123
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,340
His Highness hasn't slept day or night,

124
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,180
guarding you wholeheartedly.

125
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,660
Yuanshu and I

126
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,300
could only assist from the side.

127
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,380
That's right.

128
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,540
His Highness has been here all the time
these few days.

129
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,940
He never left.

130
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,980
He has lost so much weight.

131
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,380
Where is he?

132
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
His Highness...

133
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,980
Luo Mingxi,

134
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,300
you unlawfully modified military orders

135
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
and rerouted reinforcements
without permission,

136
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,940
leading to Anning's death

137
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
and the fall of Qingnan City.

138
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,980
What do you have to say

139
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,300
to the soldiers of the Three Armies?

140
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,060
I

141
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,300
have nothing to say.

if Official Luo's spirit is in heaven,

230
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,220
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

231
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,100
Luo Mingxi had been a brother,

232
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,340
a father, a teacher, and a friend to me
for over ten years.

233
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,940

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,540
You haven't eaten all day.

244
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,340

245
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,340
At least have some soup.

246
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,460
I'll have it later.

247
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,860

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,580

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,820
Your Highness,

250
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,860
I know you're distressed.

251
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,860
But things have come to this,

252
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,620
you can't treat...

253
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,340
Wen Shuo,

255
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,100
about what happened today?

256
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,380
Take the Di Troops

257
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,580
and move forward.

258
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,940
Young Lady,

259
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,460
it's time to rest.

260
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,820
I need to gather the Di Troops.

261
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,940
General Anning's death for the country

262
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,340
is admirable.

263
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,940
Your Highness's execution of Official Luo

264
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,580
may be a little harsh.

265
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,460
But it was crucial
to stabilize the troop's morale.

266
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,060
But this move

267
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,220
indeed crushed Anle's heart.

268
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,980
The situation in the war is critical.

269
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,340
If we didn't stabilize the troop's morale
at this moment

270
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,820
and let Northern Qin take advantage,

271
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,740
I would be ashamed to face the people

272
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,460
as the Crown Prince of Jing.

273
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,700
Wen Shuo,

274
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,460
war is cruel.

275
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,340
And I am the commander-in-chief.

276
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,820
We still have tough battles to fight
against Northern Qin,

277
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,100
and thousands of soldiers are watching me.

278
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,860
I cannot have a moment of hesitation.

279
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,820
I

280
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,220
understand.

281
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,020
I shall take my leave.

282
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,540
Come and sit with me.

283
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,340
All right.

284
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,340
Earlier,

285
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,740
His Highness confided in me
about why he executed Official Luo.

286
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,660
I know

287
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,860
he wanted to explain it to Anle the most.

288
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,340
It's just...

289
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Young Lady's resentment

290
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,740
toward His Highness has deepened

291
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,340
because of Official Luo's execution.

292
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,020
I'm afraid

293
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,340
they will have to draw a clear line between them

294
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,740
and become irreconcilable.

295
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,100
Yuanqin,

296
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,180
are we becoming enemies too?

297
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,900
When we parted ways in the capital that day,

298
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,820
I thought I would never see you again.

299
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,660
So usually

300
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,340
in my free time,

301
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,660
I often went to Ren's Residence,

302
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,380
sitting in the spot where we used
to spend time together.

303
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,020
I would spend half a day there.

304
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,180
His Highness even teased me

305
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,580
for being lovesick at a young age.

306
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,340
Later on,

307
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,580
I heard Anle was coming to the battlefield.

308
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,580
I thought I could finally get to see you again.

309
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
But then I realized

310
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,180
the dangers of the battlefield,

311
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,660
and I felt that it would be better
if you didn't come.

312
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Luckily, you are not skilled

313
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,860
in martial arts.

314
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,860
And Anle

315
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,340
-wouldn't bring you to fight in the...
-Wen Shuo,

316
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,420
I've come around.

317
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,020
What's between us is no one else's concern.

318
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Since you bravely came to me,

319
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,300
I want to honestly tell you

320
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,260
my true feelings.

321
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Well...

322
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Tell me then.

323
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,820
Wen Shuo.

324
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,180
I

325
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,660
have missed you too.

326
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,180
We shall not retreat

327
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,940
before defeating Northern Qin!

328
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,900
We shall not retreat

329
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,500
before defeating Northern Qin!

330
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,500
We shall not retreat

331
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,420
before defeating Northern Qin!

332
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,100
If we proceed like this,

333
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
it won't be long

334
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,900
before we can reclaim
several surrounding cities.

335
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,500
At that time, we must keep the main forces

336
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,420
outside the city walls.

337
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,020
Yes, General.

338
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,660
Greetings, Your Highness.

339
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,420
Ziyuan, what are you doing?

340
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Such a significant operation

341
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,580
requires careful planning.

342
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,260
You should not rush to mobilize the troops.

343
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,940
Thank you for the reminder, Your Highness.

344
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,660
I have already planned everything thoroughly.

345
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,740
You need not worry about it.

346
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,340
I still have military affairs to attend to.

347
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,260
So I'll take my leave first.

348
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,580
Ziyuan,

349
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,340
about yesterday's matter, I wanted to...

350
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,100
I understand.

351
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,420
At present, we're facing a formidable enemy,

352
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,340
so it's of the utmost importance

353
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,340
to stabilize the troop's morale
when it was disrupted.

354
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,620
I have planned

355
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,580
how to continue the battle
with the Northern Qin Army.

356
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,820
As such,

357
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,700
I have assembled all the Di Troops

358
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,540
and made the necessary deployments.

359
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,940
The Di Troops?

360
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,260
Are you referring to the pirates

361
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,180
from Anle Abode in Jingnan?

362
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,100
They are not regular soldiers

363
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,260
and can only serve as irregular forces.

364
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,940
We cannot rely on them
as the main force for battle.

365
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,020
It's not them.

366
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,100
I mean the true Di Troops.

367
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,100
I want to counterattack Northern Qin

368
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
and kill Lengbei

369
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,500
to avenge Anning.

370
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,340
Ziyuan,

371
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,580
marching and fighting require
more than just momentary courage.

372
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,140
Your Highness,

373
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,420
I treat all my soldiers

374
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,620
as if they were my brothers.

375
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,620
I will never engage in an unprepared battle.

376
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,780
Currently, the situation in the Northwest
is unfavorable,

377
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,140
and the morale of the soldiers is low.

378
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,140
Your Highness, you need a strong vanguard

379
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,540
to change the current situation.

380
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
You are right.

381
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,580
But...

382
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,860
But why must this vanguard be you?

383
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,460
I have led hundreds of soldiers from Jingnan

384
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,540
to reclaim Qingnan City.

385
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,940
I have enough prestige in the army.

386
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,380
After reclaiming Qingnan City,

387
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,460
reclaiming the other cities

388
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,620
in one fell swoop

389
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,540
will surely catch Northern Qin off guard.

390
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,380
If so, I will lead troops
to conquer the cities with you too.

391
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,060
No need.

392
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,300
Your well-being is crucial
for the stability of the Three Armies.

393
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,140
So it's better for you to stay in Qingnan City.

394
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,860
The Northwest is the burial ground of the Di Troops.

395
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,420
With many former members
scattered all over the country,

396
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,620
as a descendant of the Di family,

397
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,620
with a single call,

398
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,380
they will respond from all over the country.

399
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,620
I alone am enough

400
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,820
for this battle.

401
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,220
Soldiers of the Di Troops!

402
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
Our ancestors and comrades

403
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,820
made great sacrifices

404
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,100
to protect this land.

405
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,700
Now,

406
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,620
they watch over us from the skies
of the Northwest.

407
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,620
The battle has just begun.

408
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,540
Let us join forces

409
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,780
and reclaim the Jing cities
occupied by Northern Qin

410
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,980
to restore peace and prosperity
for the people of Jing

411
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,460
as well as honor the spirits

412
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,860
of our fallen comrades!

413
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,620
Reclaim the cities!

414
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,620
We're willing to follow the General
to reclaim the cities!

415
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,460
We're willing to follow the General
to reclaim the cities!

416
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:20,140
We're willing to follow the General
to reclaim the cities!

417
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,740
We're willing to follow the General
to reclaim the cities!

418
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,300
[Yebei City]

419
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,340
Charge!

420
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,460
Charge!

421
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,460
[Yebei City]
(Di Ziyuan led hundreds of Jingnan soldiers)

422
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,820
[Hui'an City]
(and fought their way up to Prince Lengbei's camp,)

423
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,380
(aiding in the recapture of Qingnan City.)

424
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,900
(In a short time, she regrouped the Di Troops.)

425
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,690
(With an unstoppable force,)

426
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,380
(the Di Troops reclaimed)

427
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,620
(all the lost cities for Jing.)

428
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
[Shannan City]

429
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,380
(As a result,)

430
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,500
(the once mighty Northern Qin Army in the Northwest
was retreating in a continuous defeat,)

431
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,380
(eventually leading to a complete collapse.)

432
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,780
Di Ziyuan is a fearsome enemy

433
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
to the Northern Qin.

434
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,540
But for Jing,

435
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,060
she is a heroic general
who defends the country at all costs.

436
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,980
-Incredible!
-Great!

437
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,020
[Yunjing City]

438
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,300
Your Majesty,

439
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,700
all cities in the Northwest have been reclaimed.

440
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,540
The worries at Jing's border
have been eliminated.

441
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,220
The Northern Qin Army
is now on the brink of collapse.

442
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,780
Withdrawing their troops
is only a matter of time.

443
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,940
But I heard

444
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,220
the people saying

445
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,860
that it was the Di Troops
who safeguarded Jing's territory.

446
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,620
And that with the Di Troops on the border,

447
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,460
only Jing can stand as solid as a rock.

448
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,980
It was a blessing from Your Majesty.

449
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,380
It is because of the Crown Prince's efforts
on the border

450
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,980
that Jing stands strong.

451
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,140
The Di Troops suffered heavy losses
ten years ago.

452
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,740
And Di Ziyuan managed

453
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,020
to gather them in such a short time.

454
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,380
Their strength is no less than before.

455
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Di Ziyuan sure is unbelievable.

456
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,340
Is she aiming to turn Jing upside down?

457
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,980
I

458
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,460
will not allow Jing

459
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,140
and the Crown Prince
to be in a perilous situation.

460
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,540
So Your Majesty's intention is...

461
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,460
The battle is coming to an end now.

462
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,860
The cities under Di Ziyuan's control

463
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,300
should be returned to the Crown Prince now.

464
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,620
Zhao Fu,

465
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,900
gather the Plum Blossom Agents.

466
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,300
Immediately head to Qingnan City.

467
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,940
Di Ziyuan

468
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,620
must not leave the Northwest alive.

469
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,700
Your Majesty,

470
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,060
she has won the people's hearts now.

471
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,620
If she were to die at the hands
of the imperial guards,

472
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,540
won't this...

473
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,220
Di Ziyuan will die at the hands
of the Northern Qin.

474
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,540
When the time comes,
she shall be buried as a loyal martyr.

475
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,220
I've worked tirelessly in secret for years.

476
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,900
Yet, Di Ziyuan managed

477
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,620
to crush all my plans overnight.

478
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,780
The descendants of the Di family
are indeed not to be underestimated.

479
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,140
Your Highness,

480
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,220
now that Qingnan City is taken,

481
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,380
we are caught in a difficult situation.

482
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,540
The soldiers in our battalion
can still put up a struggle.

483
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,380
But it would be difficult

484
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,700
to recapture the city ourselves.

485
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,620
Do you have a plan, Your Highness?

486
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,220
To catch the thief,
one must first catch the leader.

487
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,780
What do you mean, Your Highness?

488
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,980
The commander of the Di Troops,

489
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Di Ziyuan.

490
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,700
If we want to turn the tide,

491
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,700
we must kill her.

492
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,900
Tomorrow, I will request help from His Majesty

493
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,620
and call for a decisive battle
with all the forces of Northern Qin.

494
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,140
Currently, Di Ziyuan is guarding Qingnan City,

495
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,540
and the reorganized Di Troops
only follow her command.

496
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,140
If she dies here in Qingnan Mountain,

497
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,060
the Di Troops

498
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,900
will surely fall into chaos.

499
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,380
We'll follow your orders entirely, Your Highness.

500
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,860
(Di Ziyuan,)

501
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,860
(how can I let you reclaim the cities so easily?)

502
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,150
[Tomb of Princess Anning, General of Jing]

503
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,860
Anning,

504
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm here to see you.

505
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,700
Luo Mingxi,

506
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,540
thank you for bringing Anning home.

507
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,660
Thanks to you

508
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,700
for letting my fake death
appease the people's anger,

509
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,980
which allowed me to live as a villain.

510
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,380
Moreover,

511
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,220
I owed it to Anning.

512
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,900
All that I've done

513
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,140
is far from enough to repay what I owe her.

514
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,020
[Five days ago]

515
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,140
Miss,

516
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,700
a beautiful woman like you

517
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,580
won't hurt me,

518
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,300
right?

519
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,660
Mo Shuang,

520
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,780
I've been looking everywhere for you.

521
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,100
Lengbei.

522
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,460
Lengbei!

523
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,100
Luo Mingxi,

524
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,940
I can't believe you're still alive.

525
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,140
I brought Anning's body

526
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,420
as you requested.

527
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,940
Now, release Shuang.

528
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,940
Shuang.

529
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,660
-Lengbei.
-Shuang.

530
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,580
Shuang, are you hurt?

531
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,340
-Lengbei.
-I'm glad you're back.

532
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,660
General,

533
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
I'm taking you home.

534
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,670
[Tomb of Princess Anning, General of Jing]

535
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,940
Anning made up her mind to sacrifice herself.

536
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
She received intelligence
about Northern Qin ambushing Ziyuan

537
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,580
and sent a message to you,
telling you to deploy troops to rescue Ziyuan.

538
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,500
She knew once the order was issued,

539
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
there would be no turning back.

540
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,860
Still, she sacrificed herself

541
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,500
to save Ziyuan

542
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,180
and the Jingnan Army.

543
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,860
Luo Mingxi,

544
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,660
you have always adhered to orders

545
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,100
and never violated military regulations.

546
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,100
So you're never living as a villain.

547
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,820
Once we return to Junxian City,

548
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,100
you shall announce an order on my behalf,

549
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,660
explaining everything to the troops.

550
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,140
Since you already guessed

551
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,660
the reason behind all this,

552
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,700
I believe you understand

553
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,340
why I didn't reveal the whole truth.

554
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,340
It was for Anning's sake

555
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
and to maintain the troop's morale

556
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,500
that you concealed the truth until your death.

557
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,260
Since she was willing to sacrifice herself,

558
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,820
so you chose to remain silent

559
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,860
to protect her from criticism.

560
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,660
That's one of the reasons.

561
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,420
So if you want to clear my name,

562
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,340
it's better to wait until after the war ends.

563
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,420
Another reason

564
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,100
is you wanted me to execute you.

565
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,300
Luo Mingxi.

566
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,940
You wanted to use your death

567
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,620
to trigger Ziyuan's fighting spirit

568
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,340
and restore the Di Troops.

569
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,580
I feel uneasy about this plan.

570
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,460
I admit I had selfish interests.

571
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,940
But, Han Ye,

572
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,460
Ziyuan has devoted herself to Jing
and the people with fervent passion.

573
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,660
I beg you

574
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,580
to save her life.

575
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,700
Why do you say this?

576
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,060
I received news

577
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,100
that His Majesty dispatched
the Plum Blossom Agents to assassinate her.

578
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,020
I also received a secret report

579
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,420
that Northern Qin is launching
its largest counterattack.

580
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,820
Their target is Ziyuan.

581
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,220
Ziyuan fought

582
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,180
with all her might for Jing.

583
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,260
But it couldn't erase

584
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,500
His Majesty's suspicions toward her.

585
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,620
Everything His Majesty does

586
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,740
is for you.

587
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,020
As the Crown Prince of the country,

588
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,740
you are the successor

589
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,620
His Majesty has put so much effort
into nurturing.

590
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,860
But now, Ziyuan's reputation

591
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,260
is already on par with yours.

592
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,820
So naturally, His Majesty will not spare her.

593
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,020
As a subject,

594
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,420
the greatest taboo is to rise too high
and threaten the ruler.

595
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,540
As long as Ziyuan commands the Di Troops,

596
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,020
His Majesty will not tolerate her
for a single day.

597
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,060
But Ziyuan told me

598
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,740
that she believes in you, Han Ye.

599
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
As the successor,

600
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,260
you will surely bring an era of prosperity
to the world.

601
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,700
But you don't need to worry too much.

602
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,220
I came back this time

603
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,740
to assist Ziyuan.

604
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,020
Luo Mingxi,

605
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,060
the Plum Blossom Agents
are rare experts in the world.

606
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Even if you know they are coming
to assassinate Ziyuan,

607
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,220
do you have any way to stop them?

608
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,540
Let Ziyuan go to Junxian City,

609
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,460
and I will stay in Qingnan City.

610
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,620
But to others,

611
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,420
you must help me spread the news.

612
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,700
So that His Majesty and Northern Qin think

613
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,500
that I'm the one going to Junxian City.

614
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,820
You're putting yourself in danger.

615
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,060
It's too risky.

616
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,220
It may look risky.

617
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,020
But there's no real danger.

618
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,420
If we do this,

619
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,580
the Plum Blossom Agents
will arrive in Qingnan City.

620
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,220
I will use them for my purpose

621
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,220
and make them fight against Northern Qin.

622
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,700
When they arrived in Qingnan City,

623
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,300
they wouldn't abandon the Crown Prince

624
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,060
and turn around to assassinate Ziyuan

625
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,060
even if they found out they were deceived, right?

626
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,740
But this time, with Northern Qin's full force,

627
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,460
even if the Plum Blossom Agents are skilled,

628
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,780
this battle will be a gamble

629
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,220
with little chance of success.

630
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,140
Luo Mingxi.

631
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,260
This is a losing situation for anyone who goes.

632
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,820
Only I can provide some relief.

633
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,660
I thought

634
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,740
you let me take a move.

635
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,100
But in the end, you still win.

636
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
It's my lifelong honor to make you, Official Luo,

637
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,660
admit defeat once.

638
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,060
We're not in the imperial court.

639
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,740
You should just address me by my name.

640
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,540
(Mingxi,)

641
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,740
(it is the right choice)

642
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,460
(to restore the Di Troops)

643
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,500
(for the country and our home at this moment.)

644
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,460
(I understand your intentions.)

645
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,110
(But you didn't have to
sacrifice yourself like this.)

646
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,540
General,

647
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,940
we intercepted a confidential report
from Northern Qin.

648
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
They are gathering their troops

649
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,020
to launch a sneak attack on Junxian City.

650
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,220
While Qingnan City
is the main stronghold of Jing's army,

651
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,740
Junxian City

652
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,940
is a rear city

653
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,060
with no military reinforcements at the moment.

654
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,620
What are they planning there?

655
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,580
Young Lady,

656
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,740
I received a secret letter.

657
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,260
It seems

658
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,660
to be from Official Luo.

659
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,020
Official Luo?

660
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,420
Look.

661
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,540
(Ziyuan,)

662
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,020
(I hope this letter finds you well.)

663
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,820
(I'm all right.)

664
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,700
(Don't worry.)

665
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,660
(Before Han Ye executed me,)

666
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,740
(I switched the poisoned wine.)

667
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,420
(I faked my death to escape.)

668
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,820
(Now, with the help of Qianyue Pavilion,)

669
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,220
(I used Mo Shuang and made a deal with Lengbei)

670
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,220
(to bring Anning's body back to Junxian City.)

671
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,740
(So focus on your battle.)

672
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,580
-(Don't be distracted.)
-Luo Mingxi is alive.

673
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,460
But why would the Northern Qin Army
go to Junxian City?

674
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,260
Could it be that Lengbei
is seeking revenge on him?

675
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,780
It's time to avenge Anning.

676
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,540
All soldiers, listen up!

677
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,020
We will go to Junxian City!

678
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,740
Yes, General!

679
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,350
[Qingnan]

680
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,300
The first time I came to Qingnan City

681
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,460
was to bring back
the eighty thousand heroic souls to the capital.

682
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,660
At that time,

683
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,580
there were no more troops in the Northwest,

684
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,340
only countless white bones in this huge pit

685
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,180
waiting for me.

686
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,820
I thought

687
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,700
I'd ensure lasting peace for these people.

688
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,300
The second time I came to Qingnan City

689
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,060
was when I heard the news of Anning's death.

690
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,780
I fought my way here.

691
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,700
But even until the last moment,

692
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,580
I couldn't avenge Anning.

693
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,020
The third time I came to Qingnan City

694
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,540
was to bid farewell to you.

695
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,260
Han Ye,

696
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,420
I don't want to step foot near this mountain

697
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,300
for the rest of my life.

698
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:35,780
All right.

699
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,660
Ziyuan,

700
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,460
leave Qingnan City.

701
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,700
It's for the best.

702
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,220
It's best that we don't see one another.

703
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,580
Ziyuan.

704
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
In the face of the enemy,

705
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,860
be careful.

706
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,780
Return to Jingnan safely

707
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,780
and watch the Flower of Longing bloom.

708
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,300
Farewell serves no purpose.

709
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,540
Until the war is over,

710
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,140
let's each fulfill our responsibilities.

711
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,740
We shall not see each other again.
