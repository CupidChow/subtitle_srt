25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,230
Well, Your Highness?

26
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,480
You asked to take over the matter

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,710
to save Huang Pu.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
You don't want Pei Zhan

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
to give him a hard time because of this.

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,590
It's such a tricky case.

31
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,560
I wouldn't want to take over it.

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,310
But Official Huang

33
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,870
didn't seem very eager to work with me.

34
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,400
He is straightforward.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,510
I doubt he can understand your thoughts.

36
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,000
This is why I think

37

Your Highness understands me the best,

38
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,470
knows me the best, and cares about me the most.

39

We are a match made in heaven.

Ren Anle.

42
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,150
Sometimes, making
impromptu jokes and remarks might work,

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,030
but it's not accepted by the mainstream.

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,590
It won't work every time you do it.

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
Huang Pu is a good official.

46
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,080
You need him.

47
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,080
Let me take you to him.

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,560
Official Huang, I've been searching for you.

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,750
Your presence overwhelms me.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,080
It's His Highness.

Why are you here?

53

At ease.

(He is a fourth-rank official.)

55
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,360
(But his living condition is so austere.)

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,590
Official Huang.

57
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,120
Official Ren recommended you to me.

58
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,120
She told me you started as a case reviewer,

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,750
but you are always attentive to your duties

60
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,680
and became the vice minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
You have a lot of experience.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,080
You are one of the precious talents
of the Court of Judicial Review.

63
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,750
Indeed.

64
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,360
You are very experienced in investigations.

65
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,280

how to pry for secrets and truth.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,750
I never force people
to confess to false charges by torture

69
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,750
or take advantage of a case.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,470
That's not what Official Ren meant.

74
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,590
Yes, Official Huang.

75
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,400
We only need a scapegoat

76

to plead guilty.

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,240
With that,

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
we can both save our careers.

79
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,510
It's a win-win for us both.

80
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,000

for an impoverished student

85

Do you know why?

94
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,430
It was because I came from a poor family
with neither power nor influence.

95
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,950
My scholarly honor was taken
by the rich and powerful several times!

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,270
is simply a joke.

The poor give up everything for it,

100

102
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,070

I didn't push you aside

123

But it can't be helped.

188
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
We have a direct order from His Majesty.

189
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Until we catch the culprit,

190
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,080
you might have to starve for a few more days.

191
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,150
I...

192
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,510
A few days more?

193
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,510
I have an idea.

194
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,630
Come on.

195
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,390
Why don't we

196
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,960
get ourselves two scapegoats?

197
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,270
Everyone else can go home.

198
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,840
Right?

199
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,550
Yeah!

200
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,750
That's a sound plan, Official Ren.

201
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,630
But who should be the scapegoats?

202
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,550
Do I have to teach you about that?

203
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,870
Just get two of you out by voting

204
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,150
and make sure their confessions match.

205
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,000
Two of us?

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,670
Who should it be?

207
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,030
How could Official Ren do this?

208
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,480
It seems that she has convinced

209
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,360
the detained students

210
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,840
to make two of them the scapegoats.

211
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,000
This is outrageous.

212
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,630
Outrageous!

213
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,000
Utterly outrageous!

214
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,600
Where are you taking me, Your Highness?

215
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,630
You keep dragging me with you
without saying a word!

216
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,030
Your Highness!

217
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,240
Ren Anle.

218
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,360
I thought you were playing fool,

219
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,870
but you were actually serious about it.

220
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,750
What is the Court of Judicial Review to you?

221
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,120
Reasoning is telling right from wrong.

222
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,390
Emperor Yao was wise,
so he founded the system with judicial officials.

223
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,000
Emperor Jing was benevolent,
so he founded the Court of Judicial Review.

224
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,750
The Court of Judicial Review

225
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,030
was founded to prevent anyone

226
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,270
from being wronged or framed!

227
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,270
You failed

228
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,720
the law above you with your rash action!

229
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,550
But this case only involves

230
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,870
the rich and powerful.

231
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,120
I heard about it back in theAnle Abode.

232
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,030
In the Capital,

233
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,720
this is how a case is dealt with

234
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,630
if it involves the rich.

235
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,080
The truth doesn't matter.

236
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,480
What matters is that we use a bunch of poor fools

237
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,030
to take the blame for everything.

238
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,750
The lords will be happy with this arrangement.

239
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,870
We get the peace we want.

240
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,030
Your Highness.

241
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,080
You've lived in the Capital for so long,

242
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,360
how could you not know

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,390
how things work?

244
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,120
A righteous man will not
willfully do the wrong thing.

245
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,870
Huang Pu is a great example of it.

246
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,840
Ren Anle.

247
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,000
People always know what is right.

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,750
The metropolitan examination
decides the fate of talents.

249
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,240
If you don't take this seriously,

250
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,630
more issues will ensue.

251
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,840
Whatever.

252
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,000
This is getting on my nerve.

253
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm in a tough position.

254
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,600
I just spoke heart-to-heart
with Marquis Zhongyi,

255
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,910
and now I have to get on his bad side.

256
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,960
If I really do that, this place
will longer accommodate me.

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
Where should I go, then?

258
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
Give me a break.

259
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,150
I used to command

260
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,870
a naval force of 30,000 strong

261
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,360
and lived a carefree life.

262
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,510
Had I not fallen for you,

263
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,320
why would I come to

264
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,960
a place where I'm a complete stranger?

265
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,240
Now I have no one to command

266
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,390
and no one to count on.

267
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,240
All of these for what?

268
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,000
I shouldn't have come.

269
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,270
If you behave yourself
and don't commit any wrongdoings,

270
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,870
I'll have your back.

271
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,360
Your Highness.

272
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,910
What?

273
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,720
Let go.

274
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,670
You said you'd have my back.

275
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,870
Your Highness.

276
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
Let me get some sleep.

277
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,870
The investigation exhausted me.

278
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,030
Is she really asleep?

279
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,150
Your Highness.

280
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
His Majesty ordered the Ministry of Justice

281
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,750
to help with the investigation
for the three-day limit.

282
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,550
Official Ren

283
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,030
was exhausted from the investigation.

284
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,910
So...

285
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,840
I told you.

286
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,320
Ren Anle's quality of being unpredictable

287
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,600
might be of great help
to the Court of Judicial Review.

288
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,440
I didn't know

289
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
you'd do so well to play a dunce.

290
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,390
No one

291
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,910
in the Court of Judicial Review
has any respect for you.

292
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,120
This is the only way

293
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,240
to make them let their guard down.

294
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,910
Those who stand out and excel

295
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,030
will garner jealousy and envy.

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
It was the same

297
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,120
with the Di family all those years ago.

298
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,630
But you already stand out.

299
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,000
So many people here

300
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,270
saw you get very intimate with His Highness

301
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,030
in the yard of the Court of Judicial Review.

302
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,510
I did it so the plan

303
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,870
could go smoothly.

304
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,550
That's all.

305
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,550
Luo Mingxi.

306
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,630
I don't need the Han family to back me up.

307
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,630
I don't need Han Ye.

308
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,510
Not even him.

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
Even without him,

310
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240
I can still

311
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
have total control of the entire game

312
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,270
with my own strength.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,630
Good.

314
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,360
I must check the results.

315
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,600
[Court of Judicial Review]

316
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,360
How is it?

317
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,480
Official Ren, the voting went smoothly.

318
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,750
Very well, let's see it.

319
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,080
Official Ren.

320
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,910
Official Huang.

321
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,550
Official Ren.

322
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,720
Official Ren.

323
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,150
I frisked all of the detained examinees.

324
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,120
All of them

325
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,150
had notes on them, except for one.

326
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,270
That's a lot of notes.

327
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,320
Who was the one without notes?

328
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,120
It was

329
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,510
Gu Qishan.

330
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,870
All is well, then.

331
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,960
Marquis Zhongyi's fury

332
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,630
won't be directed at us.

333
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,630
Official Ren, are you not thinking straight?

334
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,630
Even if he didn't have notes,

335
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,000
he could still be cheating.

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,030
Perhaps, he discarded the notes beforehand.

337
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,750
Those with notes

338
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,880
could have been framed

339
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,750
by someone else afterward.

340
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,750
Yes, I hear you.

341
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,160
You are totally right.

342
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,030
But I think

343
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,640
their testimony is more reliable.

344
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,350
As long as the two of them
can give a matching confession,

345
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,880
we can close the case.

346
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,160
Official Ren, the voting result is ready.

347
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,480
It's Wu Yue and Zhou Fu.

348
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,000
Wu Yue and Zhou Fu?

349
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,350
It's decided then.

350
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,480
Release the others.

351
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,200
Official Ren...

352
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,750
Yes.

353
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,070
Official Ren!

354
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,160
Do you have no regard for their lives?

355
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,720
I interrogated them.

356
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,720
Wu Yue and Zhou Fu

357
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,110
came from the most humble families
among the others.

358
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,240
Of course those from richer families

359
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,400
would collude with each other

360
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,510
and point their fingers at them
without any hesitation.

361
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,310
Official Huang, calm down.

362
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,000
Our opportunity has presented itself.

363
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,770
[Court of Judicial Review]

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,550
(Official Pei.)

365
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,640
(Off you go.)

366
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,350
(Yes.)

367
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,030
Official Ren.

368
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,240
Congratulations, Official Pei.

369
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,750
Is the investigation over?

370
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,510
After my fearsome interrogation,

371
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,920
we found that the culprit
was either Wu Yue or Zhou Fu.

372
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,310
Official Pei.

373
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,750
The case

374
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,350
will be closed very soon.

375
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,880
Great work.

376
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
Official Pei.

377
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,030
When the case is closed,

378
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,200
don't forget

379
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,310
to put up a few good words for me

380
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,880
in front of Marquis Zhongyi.

381
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,440
Of course.

382
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,480
We are partners, after all.

383
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,750
I'm glad to hear that.

384
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,110
Official Pei, I must continue the investigation.

385
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,750
Solve the case!

386
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,750
Solving it now!

387
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,790
Sir, Marquis Zhongyi received words from Pei Zhan

388
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,030
and sent his spy to Li's Residence.

389
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,880
It seems he is playing along
with Official Ren's plan

390
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,920
and doing it the rough way

391
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,310
to get Gu Qishan out of the ditch completely.

392
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,310
Poor Li Chong'en...

393
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,750
[No animals are harmed during the shooting]

394
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,640
[No animals are harmed during the shooting]
All his hard work is in vain now.

395
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,770
[Ren's Residence]

396
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,270
Young Lady.

397
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,030
Earlier tonight,

398
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,200
the current chief examiner Li Chong'en

399
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,550
hung himself in his residence.

400
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,720
(He left a letter of apology)

401
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,070
(to His Majesty, claiming that)

402
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,720
(Wu Yue and Zhou Fu were his distant relatives.)

403
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,790
He couldn't bear to see them suffer in poverty

404
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,960
and have no future ahead of them.

405
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,310
Hence, he made the mistake

406
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,480
of leaking the questions.

407
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,200
Gu Yunnian's move

408
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,310
came at the perfect timing.

409
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,550
But I still outwit him.

410
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,720
Official Ren.

411
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,480
What is it that you seek?

412
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,790
Official Huang.

413
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,200
I need you to put up an act with me.

414
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,030
I once lived in Jingnan for a long time.

415
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,200
Of course I know how the common folk are suffering.

416
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,310
Your frustration from being mistreated

417
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,720
reflects the people's predicament.

418
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,030
As for this case,

419
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,480
as long as you are willing to lend me a hand,

420
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,550
the justice you defend so devotedly

421
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,680
shall be upheld.

422
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
The injustice you witness

423
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
shall be avenged.

424
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,750
Gu Yunnian will soon realize

425
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,790
what it means to lose every pawn.

426
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,070
[Court of Judicial Review]

427
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,790
(Zhou Fu.)

428
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,920
(Li Chong'en identified you in his suicide note.)

429
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,880
Do you plead guilty?

430
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,750
I've been wronged!

431
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,790
I didn't cheat!

432
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,350
Indeed, someone was carrying notes.

433
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,590
I overheard it when I drank with
the other young masters.

434
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,960
But it wasn't me.

435
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,030
Who is it, then?

436
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,790
Well...

437
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,750
I don't dare to tell.

438
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,270
Since you refuse to tell me,

439
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,200
he must be someone prestigious.

440
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,160
Zhou Fu.

441
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,270
An incomplete confession
is the worst in an interrogation.

442
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,200
Here in the Court of Judicial Review,

443
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,070
that won't do you any good.

444
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,720
If you go to the rich and powerful,

445
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,270
you won't get rewarded for this either.

446
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,200
So, why bother covering for them?

447
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,960
Sir, I'll tell you everything!

448
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,790
Speak now.

449
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,790
One of the chief examiners

450
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,200
leaked the question to Young Marquis Gu.

451
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,680
He was feeling smug about it,

452
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,720
so he spread the answers

453
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,550
to the others who were involved in the cheating.

454
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,270
I knew it was him!

455
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,720
There are so many new toys here.

456
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,270
I've never tried this before.

457
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,510
Official Ren.

458
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,510
I've been wronged.

459
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
The culprit framed me.

460
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,720
And who is the culprit?

461
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,510
Wu Yue.

462
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,720
Why put yourself through this?

463
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,510
The others

464
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,880
had already gone home.

465
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,550
They even got rewards from the Gu family.

466
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,160
But here you are, all alone

467
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,030
as their scapegoat.

468
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,720
Is it worth it?

469
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,510
I'll be honest with you.

470
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,200
Zhou Fu told us everything.

471
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,480
Wu Yue.

472
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,510
I heard you came from a poor family.

473
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,260
Your only family is your mother and she's waiting

474
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,230
for your return alone.

475
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,230
Think about her.

476
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,820
It wasn't me.

477
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,750
I didn't do it.

478
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,300
Luo Mingxi told me
ten new sets of cangues had arrived.

479
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,750
It's time to test them out.

480
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,870
[Court of Judicial Review]

481
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,910
Sir.

482
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,470
Sir.

483
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,580
The one Huang Pu interrogated

484
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,230
ratted Young Marquis Gu out.

485
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,620
To Marquis Zhongyi's residence! Quick!

486
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,470
Go!

487
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Darn that Wu Yue.

488
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,510
I interrogated him for so long,

489
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,750
but he wouldn't say a thing.

490
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,270
He kept repeating that he was wronged.

491
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,230
This is impossible!

492
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,510
It's no surprise he won't confess.

493
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,230
Rather than trust you,

494
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,030
he trusts Marquis Zhongyi's power more.

495
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,340
Trickery and pretense will never end well.

496
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,300
I've told you.

497
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,340
Official Ren has worked hard
on this investigation.

498
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,340
Instead of appreciating her effort,

499
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,580
Your Highness discourages her.

500
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,060
Official Luo does know how to comfort me.

501
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,060
But sadly...

502
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,820
Ren Anle.

503
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,340
You did well

504
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,060
today.

505
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,820
I know you are intelligent.

506
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,270
That is why I have

507
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,270
greater expectations for you.

508
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,670
Do not disappoint me.

509
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,060
Don't forget your promise.

510
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,990
Marquis Zhongyi went as far as

511
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,990
using a dead man to pin
the crime on Zhou Fu and Wu Yue.

512
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,470
I bet he didn't expect

513
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,710
Zhou Fu would testify
against Young Marquis Gu anyway.

514
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,030
All that is left

515
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,300
is Wu Yue.

516
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,990
Zhou Fu works for us.

517
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,750
Wu Yue lost his father at a young age.
He came from a poor family.

518
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,750
He earned Gu Qishan's trust

519
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,820
by being a weathercock and an artful person.

520
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,060
Zhou Fu

521
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,750
is only bait.

522
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,710
Wu Yue, who's followed Gu Qishan for years

523
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,580
and knows all his secrets

524
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,820
is the key.

525
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,470
Your Highness.

526
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,300
Both the white and black chess pieces
are in a stalemate.

527
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,270
The law of Jing dictates

528
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,100
that we need more than one witness.

529
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,820
If Wu Yue doesn't confess,

530
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,710
we will never

531
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,300
make any progress with this case.

532
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,100
If Your Highness needs my help,

533
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
simply ask.

534
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,060
His Highness told me

535
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,030
she deceived Pei Zhan and Huang Pu,

536
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,750
and then did the same to Wu Yue and Zhou Fu.

537
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,620
But Official Ren, you might get yourself involved

538
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,750
by solving the case this way.

539
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,230
I am His Highness's prized student.

540
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,300
I won't get stuck in a stalemate that easily.

541
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,620
Gu Qishan is Marquis Zhongyi's son.

542
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,060
Given his father's influence,

543
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,750
who would dare to testify against him?

544
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,580
Given the circumstances,

545
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,060
we can't close the case

546
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,060
unless we get his confession.

547
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,300
I may have been a bandit,

548
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,100
but I know we need at least two witnesses

549
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,230
or get the hard evidence.

550
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,990
If he refuses to budge,

551
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,990
we can figure something out

552
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,230
to throw him into a panic.

553
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,100
Yes.

554
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,780
Make him panic.

555
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,780
Yes.

556
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,750
We'll corner them into desperation.

557
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,820
I did the same in the Anle Abode

558
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,300
when I was the boss.

559
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,990
Indeed.

560
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,750
You think like a member
of the Ministry of Justice.

561
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,990
Anle.

562
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,820
What is the plan?

563
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,100
It's a flawless tactic

564
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,580
that I prepared specially for this.

565
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,340
According to the law of Jing,

566
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,190
when evidence is presented
and all doubts are cleared.

567
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,060
Even if the accused doesn't confess,
they can be charged based on the evidence.

568
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,820
In other words,

569
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,060
if we have the evidence and witnesses we need,

570
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,780
we can get the culprit convicted.

571
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,030
I memorized the books

572
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,750
Your Highness gave me.

573
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,100
It's no use unless you can solve the case.

574
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,910
If you can't solve the case,

575
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,100
you're simply constraining yourself
with these words.

576
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,340
Where are your evidence and clues?

577
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,100
If we don't have the clues,

578
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,580
we'll put them in a rigged game.

579
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,670
Like so.

580
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,910
Like what?

581
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,910
Like what?

582
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,340
Official Ren's chess piece

583
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,100
broke the stalemate!

584
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,780
Gu Qishan went home
as if nothing had ever happened.

585
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,950
But by doing so,

586
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,430
you're letting him get away with his crime.

587
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,670
Be patient.

588
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,340
In this game of mine,

589
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,430
every chess piece serves a purpose.

590
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,910
Your Highness.

591
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,540
Shouldn't you be in bed?

592
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,060
Is something on your mind?

593
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,430
Somehow,

594
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,910
I kept thinking about her these days.

595
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,820
When she was two,

596
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,670
Emperor Taizu appointed her the Crown Princess.

597
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,670
She must be quite something.

598
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,910
She was seven when she came to the Capital.

599
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,620
Her personal bodyguard,
Luo Mingxi, was always with her.

600
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,860
She barely cared about me at all.

601
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,340
My grandmother raised me attentively.

602
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,140
Of course I couldn't stand her attitude.

603
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,060
One day,

604
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,540
I interacted with her
through a game of chess, which I was good at.

605
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,100
Even though you're the Crown Prince,

606
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,860
but you can't beat me in chess.

607
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,140
You should admit defeat now.

608
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,820
Ziyuan.

609
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,230
Did you

610
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,140
acquire your skill

611
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,860
from the legendary former head
of the Di family, Di Shengtian?

612
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,950
I've defeated my grand-aunt

613
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,860
a thousand times over.

614
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,190
Honestly,

615
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,140
I've never met anyone

616
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,620
who can defeat me.

617
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,580
What are the odds?

618
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,670
Me too.

619
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,380
Ziyuan.

620
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,910
You are the first

621
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,540
to have cornered me.

622
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,780
How about another round?

623
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,950
Bring it on.

624
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,820
Speaking of which,

the girl from Dai Mountain

626
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,190
was a remarkable player too.

627
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,140
I've never met anyone whose skill in chess

628
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,710
can match hers.

629
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,340
I wonder if she can best

630
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,540
Official Ren?

631
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,140
A great chess player can analyze the situation.

632
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,060
If the girl from Dai Mountain

633
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,710
were to investigate this case,

634
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,780
would she have employed the same method?

635
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,510
One is well-educated,

636
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,430
while the other is basically illiterate.

637
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,990
They may have stratagems,

638
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,140
but the approaches will be different.

639
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,670
However,

640
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,780
both of them are one of a kind,

641
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,060
and they both

You are not drunk. Speak properly.

747
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,550
But I am.

748
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,910
Had I known you were so worried about me,

749
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,030
I wouldn't have come here
to drink my worries away.

750
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,700
I don't believe your excuses.

751
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,780
Why did Li Chong'en confess to his crime
by hanging himself?

752
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,910
Wu Yue was assassinated in prison.

753
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,550
How do we deal with it?

754
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,300
The examiner had confessed anyway.

755
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,990
The case is closed, right?

756
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,550
As for Wu Yue...

As long as

758
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,030
we find the guard
of the Court's prison for last night

759
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,830
and torture him in the interrogation,

760
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,260
he will confess.

761
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,390
Another round of torture in interrogation?

762
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,470
Right?

at this early hour?

773
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,430
For you, Your Highness.

774

We've been at it the entire day.

It will be nightfall
if you don't start working now.

I have greater expectations

779
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,830
for you than the others.

780
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,350
Therefore,

I trust you more than I do the others.

Don't worry, Your Highness.

783
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,740

We can't close the case!

The deadline is approaching.

791

You are too stubborn.

796
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,550
Do you want to lose your job for good?

797
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,550
I want justice for everyone
who takes the examination!

798
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,390
Seize him!

Without that insolent Young Marquis Gu,

we can finally enjoy Miss Linlang's dance.

821
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,870
Who knew Lin Cong's death

822
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,470
could expose a scandal about the examination?

823
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,260
The chief examiners and examinees who cheated

824
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,180
should be cursed.

825
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,740
Yes.

826
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,100
Yeah. That was outrageous.

827
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,550
How upsetting!

828
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,180
Indeed.

829
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,510
Those cheaters are so dishonest and disloyal.

They deserve the worst.

Step two, let the events take their course.
