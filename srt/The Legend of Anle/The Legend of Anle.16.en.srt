00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,580
first,

185
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,100
the people will finally pay attention
to the injustice the Di family has suffered.

186
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,940
Public opinion will help us overturn the case.

187
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,420
Second,

188
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,980
the imperial family is cautious
in treating the Crown Princess.

189
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,740
Not only can it protect her,

190
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,260
but it can also serve me
as I lay low until our case reversal.

191
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,860
You're killing two birds with one stone indeed.

192
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,460
However, don't forget.

193
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,260
You're Ren Anle, who's infatuated with Han Ye.

194
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,420
You should suppress Di Cheng'en instead.

195
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,660
Don't worry.

196
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,100
That second identity is literally part of me now.

197
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,260
Just wait and see

198
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,660
how I will belittle her in public
while flattering her in secret.

199
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,500
Mu Qing.

200
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,380
Why is the water hot?

201
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,900
Cold water is not good for the body.

202
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,020
Don't you understand what I said?

203
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,020
I want to fall sick.

204
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,140
I want to be the last to appear
on the Crown Princess selection

205
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,580
so that the Crown Prince will take care of me.

206
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,460
No one is belittling you.

207
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,900
You're just humiliating yourself.

208
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,020
Mu Qing,

209
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
what's wrong with you?

210
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,380
You always took pity on me in the past.

211
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,460
Besides,

212
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,380
even if I do fall sick,

213
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,140
you're still here to take care of me, right?

214
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,940
Even if you do attempt such folly,

215
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,700
the Crown Princess selection

216
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,780
will be perilous.

217
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,940
I wish you luck.

218
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,580
(I will never return to Dai Mountain again.)

219
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,180
(I will never be humiliated again.)

220
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,900
(I mustn't lose.)

221
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,020
[Sifang House]

222
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,380
All right, Young Lady.

223
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,700
Look.

224
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,380
Don't you think this head accessory
fits you perfectly?

225
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,500
You'll be the most beautiful of them all

226
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,060
if you wear it to the banquet tomorrow.

227
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
Lengbei, what are you doing here?

228
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,860
You may leave.

229
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,820
That hairpin looks nice.

230
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,140
Put it on.

231
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,940
Lengbei,

232
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,180
the envoy

233
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,700
told me to dress myself plainly for tomorrow.

234
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,380
You can wear this.

235
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,180
Mo Shuang, you look best in this dress.

236
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
But, Lengbei,

237
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,940
the envoy said

238
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,740
the Crown Prince doesn't like extravagant stuff.

239
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,580
How many times have I told you?

240
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,620
Forget about marrying Han Ye.

241
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,380
I don't intend to get married
to the Crown Prince of Jing.

242
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,180
But, Lengbei,

243
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,820
I'm the Princess of Northern Qin.

244
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,780
How could I lose the bet we made

245
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,620
in Lingxiang Pleasure House?

246
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,580
You're the Princess of Northern Qin.

247
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,100
Not the Crown Princess of Jing.

248
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,980
Remember.

249
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,660
You cannot marry into Jing.

250
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,420
Do not joke around.

251
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,340
Take care

252
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
when you attend the banquet tomorrow.

253
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,220
(I don't care.)

254
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,220
(I will show up in His Highness's favorite look)

255
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,100
(tomorrow.)

256
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,000
[Yuchen Hall]

257
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,100
Greetings, Grandmother.

258
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

259
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,540
Crown Prince,

260
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,740
tonight's your Crown Princess selection.

261
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,220
What's with the plain clothing?

262
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,740
The clothing the General Palace Service
had prepared was too extravagant.

263
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
I'm only selecting my consort tonight.

264
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
I'm not appointing her.

265
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,980
Therefore, I dare not make a big deal out of it.

266
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,980
Crown Prince,

267
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
I understand you have a preference
for plainness.

268
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,780
However, you shouldn't do this
for the Crown Princess selection.

269
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,980
Your mother left this hairpin behind.

270
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,780
If you have a candidate in mind,

271
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,420
you can put it on her hair.

272
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,260
Crown Prince, you're always a sensible child.

273
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
I trust

274
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,460
that you will make the right decision.

275
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,370
[25th of the 12th month,
Crown Princess Selection]

276
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,540
Your Highness,

277
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,220
why are you still here?

278
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,980
By the way, why is your clothing

279
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,740
plainer than mine?

280
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,780
Today's not a good occasion anyway.

281
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,660
Wen Shuo,

282
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
do keep yourself in check

283
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,500
during the banquet.

284
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,620
Anle.

285
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

286
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,140
Anle,

287
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,940
where are Yuanshu and Yuanqin?

288
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,540
They love lively places.

289
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,820
So they went there in advance.

290
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,940
Your Highness,

291
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
I'll go and join them.

292
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,540
Let's go.

293
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,500
Your Highness, were you dumbfounded?

294
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,180
I was just reminded of my long-lost friend.

295
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,660
Besides, you were performing a lady's greeting.

296
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,220
I was pretty surprised.

297
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,020
What's there to be surprised about?

298
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,220
I'm not here

299
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,900
as the minister
of the Court of Judicial Review today.

300
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,420
I'm here as your admirer,

301
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,460
Your Highness.

302
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,300
I wonder who he'll pick.

303
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,140
I'm sure it's Di Cheng'en.

304
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,260
Not necessarily.

305
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,540
It's been so many years since they met.

306
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,820
I don't think they still have feelings
for each other.

307
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,540
But His Highness

308
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,780
never forgot about her.

309
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,540
You do have a point.

310
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,100
But no one else

311
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,300
is a match for her.

312
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,220
Princess Anning has arrived.

313
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,620
She looks gorgeous in that outfit.

314
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,220
Anning.

315
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,700
Anning.

316
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,780
Mo Shuang,

317
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,260
you look delicate and lovely today.

318
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,620
That's not true.

319
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,220
Anning,

320
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,580
you're the true beauty here.

321
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,860
Look at you.

322
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,260
You look pretty

323
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
no matter what you wear.

324
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,460
By the way, Your Highness,

325
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,500
I heard

326
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,220
that you will choose a husband soon.

327
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,980
You see, I have an elder brother

328
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,500
who's handsome

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,620
and adept at martial arts.

330
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,500
Why don't you consider him?

331
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Thank you for your kind intention.

332
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,460
But I have no intention of getting a husband.

333
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,860
What a shame.

334
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
But, Anning,

335
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,980
I trust that you're as good as any man out there

336
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,460
when you fight on the battlefield on your horse.

337
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,620
General, let's take our seats.

338
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,940
The Crown Prince has arrived.

339
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

340
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Is that truly

341
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,740
Ren Anle, who grew up with bandits?

342
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,500
Yeah.

343
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,980
I heard that she was illiterate

344
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,660
and boorish.

345
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,780
What's with the elegant air?

346
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,100
Your Highness,

347
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,220
it's the auspicious hour.

348
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,500
Only the young ladies from the Di

349
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,860
and Zhong families aren't here yet.

350
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,980
That's fine.

351
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,260
Start the banquet first.

352
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,500
Send someone to find out

353
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,620
why they are late.

354
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,860
Yes, Your Highness.

355
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,780
Go and find out why.

356
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,340
Yes, sir.

357
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,580
The young lady of the Di family
hasn't arrived yet.

358
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,980
Your Highness, don't you intend to wait for her?

359
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,980
Now, His Majesty and Grandmother
are still not fond of her.

360
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
If people heard

361
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,580
that the banquet was delayed because of her,

362
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,260
they would pick on her even more.

363
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,100
The young lady of the Di family is lucky indeed.

364
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,260
Your Highness is taking such good care of her.

365
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,340
I'm so envious.

366
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,980
This is what I owe her.

367
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,580
It's better if she doesn't show up.

368
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,940
I will have one less rival.

369
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,820
Isn't that great?

370
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,900
Yuanqin,

371
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,900
out of all the ladies here,

372
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,340
I still think Anle is the best candidate
for His Highness.

373
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,180
It's the Crown Princess selection.

374
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,580
But, Mr. Wen, it looks like
you're paying a lot of attention to it.

375
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,060
That's not what I meant.

376
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,180
Mr. Wen, you're young and energetic.

377
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,060
It's normal that you like to
appreciate beautiful ladies.

378
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,580
That's not it.

379
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,580
Yuanqin,

380
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,060
I only have eyes for you.

381
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,300
Yuanqin, let's go.

382
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,540
You're very sick. I don't think you should go.

383
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,260
I've already suffered so much.

384
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,860
I mustn't let my effort

385
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,780
go to waste.

386
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,260
You're just reaping what you sow.

387
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,380
There's no turning back.

388
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,140
I have to become

389
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,060
the Crown Princess tonight.

390
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,660
Mu Qing,

391
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,780
you will always have my back,

392
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,420
am I right?

393
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Please be careful.

394
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,260
Your Highness.

395
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,380
Please proceed with the toast.

396
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,420
His Highness will proceed with the toast.

397
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,540
Ladies, please leave your seats.

398
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,700
Stop looking,

399
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,540
Your Highness.

400
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,540
How could you be distracted

401
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,940
when I'm right in front of you?

402
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,660
You're not acting like a gentleman at all.

403
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,540
Look.

404
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,580
The flowers are in full bloom, the moon is round,

405
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,700
and the seats are filled with guests.

406
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,460
It makes me feel like

407
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,220
they're attending our wedding banquet.

408
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,300
Ren Anle,

409
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,980
with this toast,

410
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,820
I hope you can find a better match.

411
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,500
If so, Your Highness,

412
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,820
I hope that you can choose
a Crown Princess you love

413
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,460
so that I can give up on you.

414
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,300
If that's the case,

415
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
I won't need to deceive myself again.

416
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,220
Your Highness,

417
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,500
Miss Di is here.

418
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,580
Miss Di's clothing looks very extravagant.

419
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,860
I'm afraid His Highness will not like it.

420
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

421
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,780
Your Highness,

422
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,220
sorry for being late.

423
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,100
That's fine.

424
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,620
You may rise.

425
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,060
Yes, Your Highness.

426
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,660
Miss Di, are you all right?

427
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,180
I'm to blame for my weak constitution.

428
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,820
I caught a cold last night.

429
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,580
If you're sick,

430
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,940
I'll ask someone to bring you
to the side chamber so that you can rest.

431
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,180
It's fine.

432
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,180
Your Highness, I've missed you.

433
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,940
I didn't want to miss out

434
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,460
on the opportunity to meet up with you.

435
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,460
I'm glad that you're here.

436
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,020
Jili.

437
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,220
Yes, Your Highness.

438
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,420
Take Miss Di to her seat.

439
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

440
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,220
Over here, please.

441
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,500
I thought Miss Di was someone extraordinary.

442
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
She actually used this kind of method

443
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,260
to attract the Crown Prince's attention.

444
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,980
That's right. How uncultured.

445
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,620
General,

446
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,740
it's not worth it to get angry over them.

447
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,020
How could she wear such lavish clothing?

448
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,740
Did she really forget

449
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,980
what day it is today?

450
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,020
Your Highness, I've never seen you

451
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,740
taking such good care of a woman before.

452
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,260
I thought you didn't know
how to appreciate fine ladies.

453
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,740
I see, you just didn't appreciate me.

454
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,700
Ren Anle,

455
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,100
you're one of
the most important officials of Jing State.

456
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,860
Instead of appreciation,

457
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,620
you deserve my respect and recognition.

458
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,020
Instead of taking care of you,

459
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,260
I hope that we can
support each other in the future.

460
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,820
Official Ren, you're one of
His Highness's favorite subjects.

461
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,700
I'm lucky

462
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,900
to be able to attend this banquet.

463
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,380
What does she mean by that?

464
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,140
There's a hidden meaning behind her words.

465
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,780
She's reminding our young lady

466
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,860
that she's just

467
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,460
his subject.

468
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Ren Anle and I have been through
thick and thin together.

469
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,780
We shared both honor and disgrace.

470
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,060
To me, she's more than just a subject.

471
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,940
She's also my bosom friend.

472
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,540
Your Highness,

473
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,740
using 30,000 navy forces as my dowry,

474
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,580
I came all the way to the capital
to propose to you.

475
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,980
Everyone knows that I have feelings for you.

476
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,740
But now, you're telling everyone

477
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,340
that I'm just your bosom friend?

478
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,820
But I remember

479
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,340
that you said something different

480
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,740
-when you got drunk.
-Ren Anle.

481
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,940
-What did you say again?
-Your Highness,

482
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,220
I remember

483
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,740
that you don't like to drink.

484
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,300
You still remember my habits?

485
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,820
Your Highness, I will never forget

486
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,340
the moments I spent together with you.

487
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,940
Ziyuan,

488
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,500
me too.

489
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,100
Although I don't like to drink,

490
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,700
I remember that you love to drink.

491
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:57,980
Your Highness,

492
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,860
I've already changed my name to Cheng'en.

493
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,020
I forgot.

494
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,380
Cheng'en.

495
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:19,980
Let's drink.

496
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,380
Sir,

497
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,740
are you concerned about Official Ren?

498
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,860
I'm just worried

499
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,620
that Anle has fallen for Han Ye.

500
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,020
During the Crown Princess selection,

501
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,380
she will push Han Ye

502
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,220
into the arms of Di Cheng'en herself.

503
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,380
Do you think

504
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,260
she can do it?

505
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,020
If so, shouldn't you go and check on Official Ren?

506
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
I apologize.

507
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,140
Did I scare you?

508
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,380
So,

509
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,340
are you Di Cheng'en

510
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,380
from the name list for the selection?

511
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,860
Yes.

512
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,740
When I was in Northern Qin,

513
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,020
I often heard people saying

514
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,340
that the Crown Prince of Jing

515
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,340
insists on making Di Ziyuan the Crown Princess.

516
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,100
After that, I came to Jing.

517
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,020
And I met the Crown Prince.

518
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,540
But I realized that Di Ziyuan's name

519
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,780
wasn't on the name list.

520
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,740
There was only Di Cheng'en.

521
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,500
So,

522
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,500
are you the same person as Di Ziyuan?

523
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,500
She's the daughter of a sinner.

524
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,100
Don't tell me she thinks
that she can become a different person

525
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,260
after changing her name.

526
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,260
She was imprisoned on Dai Mountain for ten years.

527
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,020
Even if she does have a temper,
it must have been tempered by now.

528
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,620
Now,

529
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,340
she looks pretty submissive to me.

530
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,260
She's willing to change her name

531
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,020
for the sake of wealth and power.

532
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,860
The descendant of the Di family, huh?

533
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,260
What a joke.

534
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,860
Precisely.

535
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,340
Shut up!

536
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,500
The Crown Prince is selecting his consort.

537
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,940
You guys have no right to say anything.

538
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,460
Anning.

539
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,180
Miss Di's name was granted by His Majesty.

540
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,700
To me,

541
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Di Cheng'en and Di Ziyuan are the same person.

542
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,620
So, the name was granted by His Majesty.

543
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,060
Cheng'en,

544
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,620
when I was in Northern Qin,

545
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,140
I heard that the Di family has a special skill.

546
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,900
I have heard of that too.

547
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,660
I heard that His Highness
has known Miss Di since young

548
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,460
and that he is infatuated with her.

549
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,460
I'm sure he knows about it too.

550
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,660
Why don't we let His Highness tell us what it is?

551
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,780
My special skill

552
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,540
is nothing

553
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,420
worth showing off.

554
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,820
Looks like Miss Di doesn't want to
show us her special skill.

555
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,460
That makes me even more curious.

556
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,660
Your Highness?

557
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,740
That special skill of hers
is truly nothing noteworthy.

558
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,460
She never likes to talk about it since young.

559
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,500
She's afraid of being embarrassed.

560
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,980
Why would she be embarrassed
about her special skill?

561
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,100
Precisely.

562
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,580
The special skill of the Di family

563
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,780
is actually a joke.

564
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,500
Outsiders think

565
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,100
that it is a secret martial arts technique

566
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,260
created by Di Shengtian,
the head of the Di family.

567
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,220
In reality,

568
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,780
it's her weiqi skill.

569
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,660
It's straightforward.

570
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,220
Her moves were easy to decipher.

571
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,740
However, she loved playing weiqi.

572
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,260
In the end, not only did she
not improve her weiqi skill,

573
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,260
but she also gained a special skill.

574
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,620
What is it?

575
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,740
That is undoing her move.

576
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,180
According to the head of the Di family,

577
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,860
she learned how to undo moves from her father.

578
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,300
It's a special skill known only to the Di family.

579
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,580
She was late because she was sick?

580
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,580
I didn't expect that from her.

581
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,820
Looks like changing her name to Cheng'en

582
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,580
hasn't rid her of her ambitions.

583
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,660
She knows that the attention
the Crown Prince is paying to her

584
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,820
is the key to becoming the Crown Princess.

585
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
It's a shame

586
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,100
that she doesn't understand

587
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,060
that it's useless

588
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
even if she makes the Crown Prince

589
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,340
help her up.

590
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,540
In the end,

591
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,660
these are just some lousy tricks
that will never work.

592
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,420
As long as I'm around,

593
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,700
the daughter of the Di family
will never be the Crown Princess.

594
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,420
Let's go and check it out.

595
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,820
Let's see what other tricks
she has up her sleeves.

596
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,660
Your Highness,

597
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,180
the scenery tonight is excellent.

598
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,700
I learned guqin since young.

599
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,540
I'm willing to play a song for you.

600
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,700
Okay.

601
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,580
Wait.

602
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,860
I want to see if Miss Di can play the guqin.

603
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,540
I heard that Miss Di

604
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,300
excels at the four arts.

605
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,180
May I, a female pirate,
have the honor of witnessing

606
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,380
your excellent skills?

607
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,780
Official Ren,

608
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,940
Miss Di is unwell.

609
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,660
I'm afraid she can't perform in public.

610
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,020
Official Ren, if you wish to hear her play,

611
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,260
you may visit her

612
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,060
in her residence some other time.

613
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,260
Your Highness, you're defending her so much.

614
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,820
I've helped Your Highness
crack two major cases.

615
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,700
And I traveled all the way to Jiangnan
because of Your Highness.

616
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,380
Not only am I not being appreciated,

617
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,820
but it's also impossible for me
to listen to some songs, huh?

618
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,100
Your Highness,

619
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,620
I can play.

620
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,660
Official Ren has rendered huge merit.

621
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,100
And you've dedicated yourself
to His Highness's cause.

622
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Naturally, I have to dedicate a song to you

623
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,540
to repay your kindness.

624
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,260
She's so conceited.

625
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,780
She's not even the Crown Princess yet.

626
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,740
She's repaying the favor

627
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,420
on His Highness's behalf now?

628
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,340
If so, Miss Di, please go ahead.

629
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,660
I can't wait.

630
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,260
Your Highness,

631
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,060
Miss Di seems to be an excellent guqin player.

632
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,740
Why didn't you tell me about that before?

633
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,140
Ziyuan loved to play with swords since young.

634
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,580
She wasn't adept at playing the guqin.

635
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,300
But there was no sword on Dai Mountain.

636
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,340
Maybe she spent all of her time on the guqin.

637
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,900
Time does torment people indeed.

638
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,100
Ziyuan

639
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,340
was tempered into

640
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,900
the current Di Cheng'en.

641
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,500
Di Ziyuan.

642
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,460
Why did you play such a song on this day?

643
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,700
Anning,

644
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,820
I've already changed my name to Cheng'en.

645
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Don't address my name wrongly again.

646
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,700
The score

647
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,420
was sent to Dai Mountain by His Highness.

648
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,620
Is there anything wrong with it?

649
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,900
You're asking me that?

650
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,140
I don't want to see you suffer again!

651
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,580
You're treating humiliation as grace.

652
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,180
You're treating your enemies as your kin.

653
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,980
You're treating this death anniversary
as if it's a joyous occasion!

654
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,660
Anning!

655
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,900
What's wrong?

656
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,660
You're drunk.

657
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,940
I remember now.

658
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,420
Today's Marquis Jing'an's death anniversary.

659
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Marquis Jing'an?

660
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,900
Isn't that Miss Di's father?

661
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,180
She's wearing such lavish clothing

662
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,580
on her father's death anniversary?

663
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,900
And she even played a song for it.

664
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,260
Today's a palace banquet.

665
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,820
Miss Di is conforming to the customs here

666
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,620
by wearing lavish clothing.

667
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,700
Anning,

668
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,060
it's my fault

669
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,180
for not considering your feelings.

670
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,220
However, I'm wearing lavish clothing
and playing joyful music

671
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,780
so that my father can rest in peace
in the underworld.

672
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,060
I hope he knows that the Han family

673
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,020
didn't mistreat me.

674
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,660
So,

675
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,540
the feisty and unruly daughter

676
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,100
of the Di family

677
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,380
has ended up like this, huh?

678
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,620
Cheng'en.

679
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,660
I guess I gave her a great name.

680
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,180
No.

681
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,540
It's my fault.

682
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,020
I didn't consider your feelings.

683
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,060
I was the cause of your suffering.

684
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,140
I have no right to reprimand you.

685
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,740
Cheng'en,

686
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,060
on account of our ties,

687
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,980
can you please listen to me

688
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,580
and withdraw from the Crown Princess selection?

689
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,380
Anning,

690
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,860
stop your nonsense.

691
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,500
My days on Dai Mountain

692
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,580
were lonely and terrible.

693
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,340
Staying by His Highness's side

694
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,580
is the only reason I live.

695
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,300
I will not change my mind.

696
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
For the Crown Princess...

697
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,220
I will support Ren Anle.

698
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,220
General.

699
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,380
Leave me alone.

700
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,140
Looks like

701
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,980
she has submitted to the imperial family

702
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,980
completely.

703
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,940
Your Majesty,

704
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,420
you can rest at ease now.

705
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,700
If she does submit to us sincerely,

706
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,980
I will grant His Highness's wish.

707
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,940
I may appoint her

708
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,860
as the Crown Princess.

709
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,620
Dances and songs go hand in hand.

710
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,860
The sword dance of Northern Qin is amazing.

711
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,180
Your Highness,

712
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,620
why don't I perform it for you?

713
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,660
Okay.

714
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,420
Thank you, Princess Mo Shuang.

715
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,180
Princess, what's wrong?

716
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,940
I think my legs are cramping up

717
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,940
after sitting too long.

718
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,900
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

719
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,340
I'm afraid I can't perform my dance tonight.

720
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,820
That's fine.

721
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,660
You may rest.

722
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,900
Since Princess Mo Shuang
cannot perform tonight,

723
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,380
why don't I perform on her behalf?

724
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:28,940
Sure.

725
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,380
I never knew that you could dance.

726
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Naturally, a boorish person like me can't dance.

727
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,940
However, I could perform

728
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,100
some sword techniques for you, Your Highness.

729
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,900
Miss Di, I need you to play a song.

730
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,660
May I have this honor?

731
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,100
Official Ren, it's my honor

732
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,620
to play for you.

733
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,940
Your Highness, if you don't mind,

734
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,540
I shall play

735
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,620
"Withering Plum Blossom".

736
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,980
I barely learned the song

737
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,900
after Your Highness taught me day after day

738
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,460
when I first entered the palace.

739
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,660
Naturally, I do remember that.

740
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,540
Your Highness,

741
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,900
I'm the one who's performing here.

742
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,540
But you're just concerned
about the song Miss Di will be playing.

743
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,940
Don't you think you're going overboard here?

744
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,540
Ren Anle,

745
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,380
there's not much space here.

746
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:27,900
Your movements will be restricted

747
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,620
if you perform here.

748
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:30,860
You must be careful.

749
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,300
Don't hurt yourself.

750
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

751
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,980
Just get ready

752
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:41,900
