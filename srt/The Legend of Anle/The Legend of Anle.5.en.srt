00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,850
can rely on their family connections
to secure official positions.

189
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,370
He's right,

190
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,220
Your Highness.

191
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,940
He's the son of Marquis Zhongyi.

192
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,180
Without the examination,
he could still become an official.

193
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,370
Why would he need to cheat?

194
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,650
That's true.

195
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,820
Come back here.

196
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,820
Sorry, My Lord, I have to go.

197
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,370
Go.

198
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,060
Speaking of which,

199
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,850
your relationship with His Highness is close.

200
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,490
Even without the metropolitan examination,

201
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,650
you can still secure a decent position, right?

202
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,060
That's right.

203
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,300
I'm talented and capable enough.

204
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,490
I don't need to rely on flattery or connections.

205
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,420
Official Huang,

206
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,370
do you have any proof of your accusation?

207
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,820
Your Highness,

208
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,060
this is a testimony from Wu Yue,

209
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,610
Gu Qishan's close friend.

210
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,220
Wu Yue?

211
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,490
How's that possible?

212
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,850
Isn't he already dead?

213
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,610
Show it to me.

214
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,100
You are sure well-informed.

215
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,980
Wu Yue died in prison last night.

216
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,420
And his death was kept secret.

217
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,370
Yet, you knew about it immediately.

218
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,530
Wu Yue was my good friend.

219
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,060
When he was locked in prison,

220
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,370
I naturally cared about his well-being.

221
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,490
But look at you.

222
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,610
You presented a confession from a dead man.

223
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,690
Who knows if it's real?

224
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,410
It is real.

225
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,610
Your Highness, take a look.

226
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,740
It's indeed Wu Yue's testimony.

227
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,730
[Testimony]
Well, this is strange.

228
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,980
Since Wu Yue died,

229
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,340
how did Official Huang extract information

230
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,860
from a dead man?

231
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,180
If his confession is not convincing enough,

232
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,530
I request you, everyone here,

233
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,810
to listen to him personally.

234
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,220
What do you say?

235
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,100
Bring it on.

236
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,740
Your Highness,

237
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,050
please allow Wu Yue to testify in court.

238
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,980
Summon Wu Yue, the witness.

239
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,700
[Yuchen Hall]

240
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,930
My Lord,

241
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,930
why are you here now?

242
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,170
His Majesty is still angry.

243
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,650
Eunuch Zhao,

244
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,170
please pass a message to His Majesty.

245
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,740
The Crown Prince is interrogating my son.

246
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,340
Ask His Majesty to think in my shoes.

247
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,100
Would he not care for his son, too?

248
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,220
My Lord, I dare not

249
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,690
deliver this message for you.

250
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Then I shall kneel here until His Majesty sees me.

251
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,460
What's the point of this?

252
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,690
You...

253
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,050
Come on, My Lord.

254
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,500
Ghost! It's a ghost!

255
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,170
Ghost!

256
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm Wu Yue. Greetings, Your Highness.

257
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
My Lord,

258
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,100
you didn't kill him.

259
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,340
Why are you so scared?

260
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,930
So, it is you, Wu Yue.

261
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,980
You're supposed to be dead!

262
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,220
Please seek the truth, Your Highness.

263
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
I've been wrongfully accused.

264
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,980
My Lord,

265
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,570
I truly didn't expect

266
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,980
that you would try to kill me.

267
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,570
Fellow officials,

268
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,460
the real culprit who leaked the question

269
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,100
is the son of Marquis Zhongyi,

270
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,460
Gu Qishan!

271
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,170
It wasn't me!

272
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,100
Your Highness! Official Ren!

273
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,810
It wasn't me!

274
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,170
You're spouting nonsense!

275
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,980
I considered you my best friend

276
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,100
and gave you so many benefits!

277
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,690
How dare you frame me!

278
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,930
Gu Qishan hired someone

279
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,460
to kill me!

280
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,100
But you're not dead.

281
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,220
Official Ren, I didn't do that.

282
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,980
The testimonial evidence is confirmed.

283
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Let's see how Young Marquis Gu can get out of this.

284
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,570
A dead man came back to life.

285
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,570
Anle's arrangement

286
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,100
is indeed a spectacle.

287
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,290
Of course.

288
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,220
Your Highness,

289
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,980
Gu Qishan somehow obtained the answers

290
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,220
from the examiners.

291
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,930
But he was too ostentatious,

292
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,460
always boasting he'd be the first place.

293
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,620
Someone provoked him.

294
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,570
So, when he was drunk,

295
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,460
he gave the answers to those profligates.

296
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,980
Your Highness, I didn't do that.

297
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,930
He's trying to frame me!

298
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,570
Mere words are not evidence.

299
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,460
Who knows if you made it up?

300
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,810
He used to be worthless,

301
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,220
but that doesn't mean he can't strive and progress.

302
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,740
Can't he make
a remarkable accomplishment in the exam?

303
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,220
That's right.

304
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,930
Well, I used to be a pirate.

305
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,740
Do you believe it?

306
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,860
Ren Anle.

307
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,380
Gu Qishan,

308
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,690
you insist that you didn't cheat.

309
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,380
I'm sure you can state your answers in the exam.

310
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,980
Present the exam paper.

311
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,620
My Lord, here comes your chance.

312
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,930
His Highness

313
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,930
specifically found your exam paper

314
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,100
from the stack of exam papers.

315
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,100
All you need to do now is repeat

316
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,220
what you wrote in this exam paper.

317
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,980
His Highness will absolve you right here.

318
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,690
And,

319
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,930
he'll personally send you back home

320
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,570
and apologize to your father.

321
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,570
How about that?

322
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,980
Your Highness,

323
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,890
did I say that correctly?

324
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,380
Yes.

325
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,460
My Lord,

326
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,170
His Majesty requests your presence.

327
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

328
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,810
Yunnian,

329
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,620
look at the building I'm working on.

330
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,570
What do you think?

331
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,930
This beam is

332
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,340
way too long.

333
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,980
In this case,

334
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,690
there will be hidden dangers in the building.

335
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,340
With one slight mishap,

336
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,340
it'll end up like this.

337
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,340
For everything,

338
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,170
there's always a rule.

339
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,460
No one should go too far.

340
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,980
Yunnian,

341
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,980
am I right?

342
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,020
Thank you for your guidance, Your Majesty.

343
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,460
Yunnian,

344
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,650
get up.

345
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,650
Your Majesty.

346
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,460
Your son's case

347
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,890
has not yet been determined.

348
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,980
The Three Monitoring Offices are handling it.

349
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,220
I believe

350
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,220
the Crown Prince will handle it impartially.

351
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,340
He won't wrong your son.

352
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,100
And you know.

353
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,170
The Crown Prince is the most upright and fair.

354
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,100
Once there is an outcome,

355
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,940
I'll make the final decision.

356
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,700
Even if you don't trust the Crown Prince,

357
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,740
will you not trust me?

358
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,850
I'll leave it to Your Majesty to decide.

359
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,330
Your Highness, I was too nervous during the exam.

360
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,220
I don't remember what I wrote.

361
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,500
I wrote everything casually.

362
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,460
Uh...

363
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,980
It doesn't matter.

364
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,570
It's understandable.

365
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,220
It's normal for him not to remember what he wrote.

366
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,980
After all, the question is quite difficult.

367
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,460
That's right.

368
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,050
Something about "The Way of the Common People"?

369
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,700
I don't even know what that means.

370
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,570
That's right.

371
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,220
I pondered this question for a long time.

372
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,330
I didn't know what to write.

373
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,810
Gu Qishan!

374
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,260
Nothing in this exam

375
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,810
was about "The Way of the Common People"!

376
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,090
You can't remember what you wrote, fine.

377
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,850
But you don't even know the question itself!

378
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,050
How dare you claim you wrote it by yourself!

379
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,330
Ren Anle!

380
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,570
How dare you trick me!

381
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,330
Do I need you to teach me how to run a trial?

382
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,700
Gu Qishan,

383
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,700
do you admit cheating in the exam?

384
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,570
So what if I admit it?

385
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,460
And what if I don't?

386
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,770
I gave the paper to Wu Yue, so what?

387
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,940
I'm the legitimate son of Marquis Zhongyi

388
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,180
and this is a mere cheating case.

389
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,500
Punish me as you wish!

390
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,530
Gu Qishan,

391
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,130
did you just say

392
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,500
it was you

393
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,740
who gave Wu Yue the paper?

394
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,900
Yes, I leaked the exam question. So what?

395
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,020
Fine.

396
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,330
Since you've already confessed,

397
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,940
[Guilty Official Li Chong'en]
let's uncover more truth.

398
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,900
Explain the chief examiner's death.

399
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,900
It seems to contradict

400
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,330
his suicidal letter.

401
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,420
Young Lady patted the gavel

402
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,500
really aloud.

403
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,180
She must have been desperate to do that.

404
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,330
Pretending to flatter Gu Qishan

405
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,330
is quite a mental challenge.

406
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,850
I can't do that.

407
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,740
That's why His Highness always instructs me.

408
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,810
Who just said he was capable enough?

409
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,740
That depends on whom I'm compared to.

410
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,570
To His Highness and Anle,

411
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,740
I can't compare.

412
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,660
But to you,

413
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,090
I think I...

414
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,420
I didn't kill him.

415
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,570
Enough! The evidence is conclusive!

416
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,050
Hereby, I announce the offender, Gu Qishan,

417
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,940
cheated in the exam, leaked the question,

418
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,540
got his mentor killed and tried to murder Wu Yue.

419
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,370
-He...
-Official Luo,

420
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,130
what is the punishment for Gu Qishan

421
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,130
according to the Jing State Law Code?

422
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
Your Highness,

423
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,500
cheating in the exam

424
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,540
is a capital offense.

425
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,940
Take him away and behead him.

426
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,090
Your Highness, I only cheated in the exam.

427
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,610
For the sake

428
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,370
that my father contributed to our state,

429
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,460
please spare. Please spare my life.

430
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,700
Gu Qishan,

431
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,330
even if you are Marquis Zhongyi's son,

432
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,780
you have no right to destroy

433
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,940
everyone's trust in the exam.

434
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,460
No, I don't.

435
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,370
Our scholars have studied hard for years

436
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,220
and taken many exams
before the metropolitan examination.

437
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,330
Yet, it's nothing in your eyes.

438
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,610
What do you think our examination is?

439
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,370
What do you think it is?

440
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,130
Your Highness,

441
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,130
tell him what it is.

442
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,700
The metropolitan examination is

443
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,220
the fundamental basis
for selecting talents in our state.

444
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,540
When it's a mess, so will our state.

445
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,460
Without the metropolitan examination,

446
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,610
we couldn't get talents or soothe our people.

447
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,980
Then how could we have decades of peace?

448
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,940
Great point.

449
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,460
Understood?

450
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,370
Yes, yes.

451
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,610
Look at the officials right here.

452
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,060
Which one of them

453
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,370
didn't study hard for decades
before they could be an official?

454
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:21,850
If...

455
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,090
If they didn't experience it themselves,

456
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,780
why would they risk their future

457
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,170
for the truth of a mere case?

458
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,780
And look at our scholars out there.

459
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,780
Which one of them

460
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,700
doesn't harbor ambitions and aspirations?

461
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,130
Without hopes for the future,

462
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,130
why would they wait here

463
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,700
only to seek a fair judgment?

464
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,410
I...

465
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,610
Gu Qishan!

466
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,780
You cheated in the examination,

467
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,890
spread the paper,

468
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,410
got Li Chong'en killed,

469
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,980
and attempted to kill Wu Yue.

470
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,130
In addition,

471
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,130
your attitude was terrible
when you ranted in court

472
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,300
and disrespected the law.

473
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,540
I shall strip you of your status as a candidate

474
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,460
and sentence you

475
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,890
to be executed after autumn!

476
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,610
Somebody, take him away!

477
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,370
Your Highness!

478
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,540
No! Please, Your Highness!

479
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,130
No, Your Highness!

480
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,890
Please!

481
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,370
Let me go!

482
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,130
Please, Your Highness!

483
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,020
-Great!
-It's wise of you, Your Highness!

484
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,540
Your Highness, well-judged!

485
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,540
Your Highness!

486
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,650
Your Highness!

487
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,650
-A well-delivered sentence!
-Well done!

488
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,810
-Great!
-His Highness is wise!

489
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,410
-This is how it should be!
-Fair sentence!

490
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,570
-Excellent!
-Well done!

491
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,220
Thank you, Your Highness!-Thank you!

492
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,260
-Marvelous!
-His Highness made a great point!

493
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,130
Your Highness!

494
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,130
People may have different family circumstances.

495
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,700
But I believe

496
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,780
as long as you make effort,

497
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,220
you can change your current situation.

498
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,890
You are the pillars of our state.

499
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,890
I hope

500
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,980
you'll do your best in the upcoming examination.

501
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,700
The bright future of yours

502
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,460
will contribute to the prosperity of our state.

503
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,940
-Well said!
-Great!

504
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,610
-Thank you, Your Highness!
-Thank you!

505
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,300
-Thank you, Your Highness!
-Great!

506
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,220
Gentlemen, when you pass the examination,

507
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,700
I'll definitely treat you to a drink!

508
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,500
-Nice!
-Awesome!

509
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,170
Official Ren, wait for us!

510
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,260
-Your Highness!
-Great!

511
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,940
-Great!
-Nice!

512
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,330
The court session is concluded.

513
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,500
Adjourned.

514
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,540
-Your Highness is wise.
-Great point.

515
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,980
-All right.
-Let's go.

516
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,700
That's a great relief.

517
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,940
I heard from Anle

518
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,060
that this case was done in three steps.

519
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,460
She lured Gu Qishan, pretended to help him,

520
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,330
and then made him confess.

521
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,460
I understand the last two.

522
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,460
But what does the first step mean?

523
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,780
She managed to lure Gu Qishan,

524
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,540
based on creating something out of nothing.

525
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,130
The case is true, but the evidence is forged.

526
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,890
Did you also doubt

527
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,540
the timing and location of the cheat sheets

528
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
were really weird

529
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,300
as if they were fabricated, right?

530
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,370
Yes, I did.

531
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,460
The truth is...

532
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,060
What is it?

533
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,850
That's it, then.

534
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,410
Let's go.

535
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,940
-It's mine!
-Mine!

536
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,460
Oh, I see.

537
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,090
Wait.

538
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,570
Then when His Highness is with Anle,

539
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,740
wouldn't he be in danger?

540
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,350
[Court of Judicial Review]

541
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,330
Your Highness, are you satisfied
with my performance just now?

542
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,850
Yes.

543
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,570
Does that mean you approve of me?

544
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,130
Then can I get a higher position?

545
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,420
Ren Anle,

546
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,570
you made contributions
to solving the cheating case.

547
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,180
Pei Zhan will be dismissed.

548
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,180
You are about to take his place

549
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,330
and be promoted to the third rank.

550
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,180
Why bother about a mere position?

551
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,740
I must have been working with you for so long,

552
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,090
so you forget why I came to the capital.

553
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,570
I secured a position in the throne room

554
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,330
and I traveled a long way to see you.

555
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Just because I adore you, Your Highness.

556
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,570
Ren Anle,

557
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,090
I've seen you in naval battles

558
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,130
and witnessed your handling of public affairs.

559
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,500
I know you're not that kind of person.

560
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,420
Your Highness, you don't believe that I like you?

561
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,260
You don't have to use me as a cover.

562
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,740
You're heroic and intelligent.

563
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,090
Only shallow people

564
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,180
would think you're a true fool.

565
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,500
Official Luo,

566
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,810
His Highness played along with me.

567
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,940
Does it mean he considers me a close friend?

568
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,180
Official Ren,

569
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,220
I also played along with you.

570
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,570
Guess.

571
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,180
Am I considering you a close friend?

572
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,850
You have a rather cold temperament.

573
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,090
When you cooperated with me,

574
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,740
you naturally considered me close.

575
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
If I had encountered you in my abode first,

576
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,050
I would not ask to marry His Highness,

577
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,740
but you, the Minister of Justice.

578
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,740
Official Ren，

579
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,810
Official Luo doesn't tolerate such jokes.

580
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:22,810
Forgive her.

581
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,050
Why did you apologize on my behalf?

582
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,180
Official Luo.

583
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,090
Official Luo!

584
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,500
The esteemed Marquis Zhongyi

585
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,940
was just harshly slapped in the face.

586
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,420
By me, Ren Anle!

587
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,850
Are you leaving just like that?

588
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,090
No celebration feast?

589
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,370
How could you get along with someone like him?

590
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,850
You both behave improperly.

591
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,570
Official Luo was different from the start.

592
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,900
When Ziyuan came to the capital,

593
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,180
Luo Mingxi was her guard.

594
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,940
Unfortunately,

595
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,500
in this vast capital city,

596
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,020
only he and I

597
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,330
can still talk about her.

598
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,420
Her?

599
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,570
Now you even tell me about her.

600
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,090
Does it mean we're even closer?

601
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,090
In this case,

602
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,260
am I closer to your heart, too?

603
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,570
Ren Anle,

604
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,420
what exactly...

605
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,900
What?

606
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,420
Your Highness, the carriage is ready.

607
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,810
Official Huang sure can't read the room.

608
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,460
How annoying!

609
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,180
What were you saying, Your Highness?

610
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,940
Let's continue.

611
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,180
When did you team up with Official Huang?

612
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,420
Accompany me to Lingxiang Pleasure House

613
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,260
and I'll tell you.

614
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,810
This tea from the western mountain tastes great.

615
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,330
Only you, Official Lao,

616
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,330
have the luxury to enjoy tea here.

617
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,980
Now, Your Highness,

618
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,090
you have a capable helper.

619
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,570
I can naturally maintain unworried.

620
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,740
You seem quite familiar with her.

621
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,090
You're quite concerned.

622
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,740
About her or me?

623
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
I was just surprised.

624
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,330
Ren Anle met you for the first time,

625
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,740
but she gained your approval.

626
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,330
Why don't you just get to the point?

627
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,090
Please help me investigate Ren Anle.

628
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,700
Are you saying

629
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,020
you don't believe what she wants

630
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,980
is to be the Crown Princess?

631
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,090
Ren Anle is brave and resourceful.

632
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,740
The title of the Crown Princess

633
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,020
is not worth all the trouble she went through

634
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,330
in the cheating case.

635
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,020
All right then.

636
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,290
I'll help you figure it out.

637
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,260
"Official Ren, I thought you were ignorant before.

638
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,900
But after this case, I realized

639
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,370
that you had great wisdom. Impressive."

640
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,940
Ren Anle,

641
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
I have an important matter to ask you.

642
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,740
Are you referring to our marriage?

643
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,090
I know

644
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,330
you're hiding something from me.

645
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,570
Do you mean

646
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,460
you want me to be honest with you?

647
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,260
Since I've chosen to trust you,

648
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,570
I hope you can trust me too.

649
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,420
All I think about now

650
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,020
is how to be the Crown Princess.

651
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,330
By then, you will understand my heart.

652
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,970
[Marquis Zhongyi's Residence]

653
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,770
My Lord.

654
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,770
My Lord,

655
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,260
what did His Majesty say?

656
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,420
His Majesty said

657
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,740
it'd be handled fairly.

658
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,220
I begged and begged. But our son would be exiled.

659
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,290
So, he's just ruined, right?

660
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,330
My Lord,

661
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,290
will we just lose Qishan?

662
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,660
What about Ren Anle?

663
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,500
She...

664
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,090
She solved a major case.

665
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,180
Naturally, she gained His Majesty's favor.

666
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,130
She used my son as a stepping stone.

667
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,900
An esteemed marquis like me

668
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,460
was fooled by a female pirate!

669
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,180
My Lord...

670
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,610
Dear, rest assured.

671
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,180
I won't let Ren Anle off easily!

672
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,570
My Lord...

673
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,150
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

674
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,900
Come on.

675
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,850
Place your bets, place your bets!

676
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,660
I'll go!

677
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,260
And me. Me too!

678
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,290
All in!

679
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,260
Me too!

680
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,050
Me too!

681
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:42,850
Come on.

682
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
I'm betting on Ren Anle too!

683
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,090
[Ren Anle]

684
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,980
Excuse me.

685
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,220
Your Highness,

686
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,660
seems that everyone is betting on me to win.

687
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,570
How do you see it?

688
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,330
With my eyes.

689
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,770
Then what do you think about it?

690
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,330
It's not worth thinking about.

691
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,530
I didn't bet on Ren Anle previously.

692
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,940
So I'm betting on her now.

693
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,420
That's right.

694
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,570
It won't be wrong to bet on her.

695
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,850
Listen to me, bet everything you've got.

696
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,740
All right.

697
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,900
-Hurry, hurry.
-I'll listen to you, then.

698
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,850
Fellow companions,

699
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,330
sorry for taking a bit of your time.

700
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,090
I believe you all know

701
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,740
the reason and consequence of this bet.

702
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,660
Of course, we do.

703
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,460
At first,

704
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,850
everyone thought I, Ren Anle,

705
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,420
couldn't be the Crown Princess.

706
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,330
But today,

707
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,290
things have changed dramatically.

708
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,810
His Highness and I

709
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,260
made a great agreement.

710
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,500
For every mission I complete,

711
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,940
His Highness

712
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,090
will level up my position.

713
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,570
Your Highness,

714
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,090
in front of so many people,

715
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,740
do you or do you not acknowledge this deal?

716
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,050
I do not, of course.

717
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,090
Look.

719
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,290
Your Highness, you have to acknowledge it.

720
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,330
Or else it would be easy for you

721
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,570
to settle this bet.

722
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,740

723
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,940

724
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,420
a big cheating case.

725
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,090
[Nobody. Lady of Decorous Service]
So my position has risen from here to here.

726
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,090
It means

727
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,090
[Crown Princess]
I'm one step closer to being the Crown Princess.

728
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,570
-Impressive!
-Bravo!

Bet more.

747
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,370
Your Highness!

748
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,850
Your Highness.

749
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,900
Your Highness,

750
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,610
I'm so happy today.

751
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,900
Because you had a chance to escape,

752
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,740
but you stayed behind

753
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,090
and played along with me.

754
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,330
Ren Anle,

755
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,940
I didn't embarrass you

756
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,020
because you solved a major case

757
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,900
and earned a reputation,

758
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,420
and also because you offended Marquis Zhongyi

759
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,330
and made an enemy of him.

760
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,850
When I stay with you today,

761
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,870
people will respect and trust you.

762
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,390
And Marquis Zhongyi's men

763
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,580
wouldn't dare to take revenge rashly.

764
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,390
As for other matters,

765
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,990
don't overthink.

766
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,700
Your Highness!

767
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,140
The imperial decree arrived at your residence.

768
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,100
Please return as soon as possible.

769
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,140
Don't forget about my celebration feast!

770
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,750
[Yuchen Hall]

771
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,180
Your Majesty, your tea.

772
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,430
Your Highness, please.

773
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:49,910
Your Majesty,

774
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,390
I heard

775
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,140
you sentenced Gu Qishan to exile.

776
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,100
But according to the law,

777
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,620
he deserves to be executed.

778
00:34:59,620 --> 00:34:59,990
Sit.

779
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,220
Have some tea first.

780
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,350
Son,

781
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,390
can you drink the tea now?

782
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,910
If you drink it hastily,

783
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,390
you'll scald yourself.

784
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,140
Let it cool down first.

785
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,550
No rush.

786
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,390
Your Majesty, do you mean

787
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,620
Marquis Zhongyi?

788
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,300
He holds strong military power

789
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,390
and has occupied Jiangnan for many years.

790
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,660
You and Ren Anle

791
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,620
just took over
his Court of Judicial Review.

792
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,620
And now you want to kill his son.

793
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:43,950
You should know

794
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,220
when a dog gets desperate,

795
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,660
it'll bite its master.

796
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,260
Come on, son.

797
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,030
You're just too hasty.

798
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,870
But Ren Anle assistance for you

799
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,830
has unexpected effects.

800
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,390
I think

801
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,070
having her by your side is a good thing.

802
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,910
One should patiently wait for the right time

803
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,300
to take action.

804
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,550
Thank you for your guidance, Your Majesty.

805
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,700
You have achieved a great victory.

806
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,510
I should congratulate you.

807
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,910
But what defines true victory?

808
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,100
Gu Qishan will be exiled instead.

809
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,550
Several lives were lost,
officials protested with their lives,

810
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,350
and thousands of exam candidates had hot tears.

811
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,100
But nothing outweighed

812
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,260
the sentimental emperor.

813
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,550
You should know Han Zhongyuan is suspicious.

814
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,910
In his eyes,

815
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,580
a compliant treacherous minister

816
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,300
matters more than a loyal minister.

817
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,470
By the way,

818
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,550
your old friend,

819
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,870
Princess Anning, who guards the northwest,

820
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,260
will be arriving in the capital in a few days.

821
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,510
The hatred between the Han family and my family
has nothing to do with her.

822
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,740
But anyway,

823
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,550
she's one of the Han family.

824
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,620
Eventually, she'll be aware of your plans.

825
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,070
I understand.

826
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,180
The cheating case

827
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,100
was solved too smoothly.

828
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,580
Han Ye began to suspect you.

829
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,140
That's why he assigned me to investigate you.

830
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,390
I asked to marry him with my 30,000 naval forces.

831
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,260
If Han Ye, the Crown Prince,

832
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,660
believed it so easily,

833
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,350
he would be no different
from the onlookers in this tea house.

834
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,780
But you blew up your cover
in front of Marquis Zhongyi.

835
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,390
It'll make the situation somewhat tricky.

836
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,470
Don't worry, I've prepared in advance.

837
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,350
[Marquis Zhongyi's Residence]

838
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,600
[Marquis Zhongyi]

839
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,580
Yuanqin,

840
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,100
you should focus when playing chess.

841
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,300
Too bad.

842
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,780
I was about to win.

843
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,100
Young Lady.

844
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,580
Don't worry. They'll be taken care of.

845
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,660
How dare you assassinate us

846
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,740
with such poor martial arts?

847
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,350
Yuanshu, end it quickly.

848
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,070
All right.

849
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,620
Watch your left.

850
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,830
Are you all right?

851
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,740
Are you hurt?

852
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,220
I...

853
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,740
I'm fine.

854
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,470
Anle,

855
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,550
are you hurt?

856
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,910
They're clearly trying to kill me.

857
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,700
But no one cares about me.

858
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,260
That's not true.

859
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,070
His Highness cares about you.

860
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,580
See?

861
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,660
He even sent his guards to protect you.

862
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,830
Yuanshu, stop.

863
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,950
He's the Crown Prince's guard.

864
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,990
He's on our side.

865
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,580
That's great!

866
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,740
What's wrong with Yuanshu?

867
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,070
Why is she fighting with our own men?

868
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,780
She gets excited when she fights someone strong.

869
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,350
Again.

870
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,510
If I hadn't spoken just now,

871
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,550
I could have subdued you in one move!

872
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,350
Don't leave!

873
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,180
"One should patiently wait for the right time
to take action."

874
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,510
His Majesty is right.

875
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,510
If we cannot nip problems in the bud,

876
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,350
we shouldn't act recklessly.

877
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,390
Even so,

878
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,660
I'm afraid we'll have to wait for too long.

879
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,660
His Majesty's decision

880
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,740
has disappointed me to some extent.

881
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,350
By the way,

882
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,780
how's your investigation on Ren Anle?

883
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,550
She appears to be carefree,
but she's profound inside.

884
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,470
She commands 30,000 naval forces,
maintaining peace in one region.

885
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,300
She has too much time on her hands.

886
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,180
Or she probably has some ideas

887
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,580
on her mind.

888
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,990
She aspires to serve our state.

889
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,030
So,

890
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,990
to seek a foothold in the capital,

891
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,580
she wants to...

892
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,300
Now that you understand, Your Highness,

893
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,910
why not rise with the occasion?

894
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,470
Your Highness,

895
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,660
Yuanshu and Yuanqin are here.

896
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,780
Let them in.

897
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,070
Come in.

898
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,390
Greetings, Your Highness, Official Luo.

899
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,780
Our lady sent us to express her gratitude.

900
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,390
Last night, some men assassinated her.

901
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,100
Thank you for sending your guards to protect her

902
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,950
so that she was not harmed.

903
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,990
What do you mean by protection?

904
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,550
He was clearly spying on us.

905
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,950
What do you mean by spying?

906
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,550
His Highness clearly...

907
00:41:59,550 --> 00:41:59,990
Wen Shuo.

908
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,300
Since Official Ren has a strong guard,

909
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,660
go get Jian Song back.

910
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:07,830
Yes, Your Highness.

911
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,700
Your Highness,

912
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,470
my lady is waiting at Lingxiang Pleasure House

913
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,910
to have a talk with you.

914
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,510
Let's leave this game for now.

915
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,660
We'll continue another day.

916
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,200
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

917
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,390
Your Highness, there you are.

918
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,180
Come.

919
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,580
Studying the case files
of the Court of Judicial Review?

920
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,580
Yes.

921
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,350
I want to uncover all these unjust cases

922
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,470
as soon as possible.

923
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Then I can become the Crown Princess soon.

924
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,870
Gu Qishan

925
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:55,780
will be exiled instead.

926
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,220
It's all right. There's still plenty of time.

927
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,660
But Your Highness,

928
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,070
you feel guilty about it

929
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,180
and I have nothing to lose, anyway.

930
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,830
Well, I assume this meal

931
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,300
will be on you today.

932
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,370
