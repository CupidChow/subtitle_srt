Your Highness.

82
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,120
What did you just call me?

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,430

84

You were young back then,

89

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,100
(to protect and defend)

191
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
(the justice)

192
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,140
(of the Jing State.)

193
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,380
I make it my lifelong duty

194
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,980
to bring peace

195
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,260
and prosperity

196
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,260
to my subjects.

197
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,980
It's nearly impossible to reconcile

198
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,140
the differences between the Dis and the Hans.

199
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,860
But time has changed.

200
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,380
Whether I'm Wen Shuo or Di Jinyan,

201
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,260
I should stay by His Highness.

202
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,020
For he had raised me.

203
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,380
I would share

204
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
your duty with you.

205
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,740
I would use my life to serve you,

206
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,620
to help you fulfill your duty.

207
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,620
My ancestors from high above,

208
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,740
bear witness to the oath I'm taking today.

209
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,980
Grant upon my nation longevity.

210
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,140
Long live

211
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,770
the Jing State!

212
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,020
Your Highness.

213
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,170
Why are you here?

214
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm staying.

215
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,770
I aspire to be like you.

216
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,980
I want to fight fearlessly

217
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,290
on the battlefield.

218
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,620
I will not back down.

219
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,020
Do you know what's at stake?

220
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,570
Are you trying to throw your life away?

221
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,740
Leave now!

222
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,380
Sorry, I cannot comply.

223
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,220
Leave!

224
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,100
No!

225
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,620
Leave!

226
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,380
No!

227
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:04,740
Guards!

228
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,620
I don't want to go to Junxian City.

229
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,860
Take him to Junxian City.

230
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,140
No, Your Highness.

231
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,260
Let go of me!

232
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,140
Your Highness.

233
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,340
Ziyuan is in good company.

234
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,980
But you only have me.

235
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,500
Just like my bloodline, it is irrefutable.

236
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,500
I was raised by you alone.

237
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,620
No one can change that.

238
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,020
Your Highness.

239
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,260
Please let me stay with you.

240
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,380
Okay.

241
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,020
We're in this together.

242
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,340
Yes.

243
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,380
And we will defeat those Northern Qin men.

244
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,500
Everyone from Jing will know

245
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,140
that you

246
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
have a formidable

247
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,500
and loyal subordinate.

248
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,860
Let's go.

249
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,260
Let's go to Qingnan City.

250
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,980
Okay.

251
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,120
[Northern Qin Outpost]

252
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,620
I have news!

253
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,260
Yes?

254
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,860
Your Highness,

255
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,740
our scouts reported

256
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,500
that the Di Troops
are patrolling Qingnan Mountain.

257
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,140
Our spies also added

258
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
that Di Ziyuan stationed the command center

259
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,620
in that location.

260
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,500
Qingnan Mountain?

261
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
[Qingnan Mountain, Qingnan City]

262
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,930
That's a good place for a grave.

263
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,170
Since Di Ziyuan is eager to stay there,

264
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,980
I will grant

265
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,860
her death wish.

266
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:59,070
[Northern Qin Outpost]

267
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,140
I heard from other soldiers

268
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,260
that the Northern Qin

269
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,140
is less active now in the vicinity.

270
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,500
But my intel told me

271
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,260
that

272
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
they are coming to us.

273
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,740
Things can change in an instant on a battlefield.

274
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,140
And it's difficult to determine
the veracity of the information.

275
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,100
Wait.

276
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,260
What is happening?

277
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,020
The Northern Qin Army at Qingnan Pass

278
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,020
is on the move.

279
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,980
They are divided into two groups.

280
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,500
One went to Qingnan City.

281
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,140
The other went to Qingnan Mountain.

282
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,500
Qingnan Mountain?

283
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,500
What for?

284
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,620
The location is the stronghold of His Highness'

285
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,620
forces.

286
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,620
What?

287
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,380
What?

288
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,890
Let's go.

289
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,460
Beware of falling rocks!

290
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,100
Your Highness, your plan is working.

291
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,740
Stay calm, my comrades.

292
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,980
Climb up!

293
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,500
We have thousands of men.

294
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
We are not afraid of them!

295
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,740
Charge!

296
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,650
Your Highness,

297
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,740
nearly all of Lengbei's men

298
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,380
are deterred by the falling rocks.

299
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Don't celebrate too early.

300
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,810
Lengbei mobilizes all the troops of his nation.

301
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,140
We are severely outnumbered.

302
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,860
It's just that we have
the geographical advantage

303
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,980
and Lengbei was caught off guard.

304
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,860
That's why we have the upper hand now.

305
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,260
However, their losses here

306
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,740
will only make them more desperate.

307
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
Brace yourself.

308
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,530
Yes, sir.

309
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:27,890
Your Highness?

310
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,380
I have been waiting for you.

311
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,860
Even if you want to kill Ziyuan today,

312
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,860
you'll have to protect me first.

313
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,380
We are not far from Junxian City.

314
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,140
Powerful as you may be,

315
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,380
you are unable to protect her.

316
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,500
We're in a dire situation.

317
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,740
If I fall in Qingnan Mountain,

318
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,260
what will killing Ziyuan achieve

319
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,740
for His Majesty?

320
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,860
You're using your life

321
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,500
to trap us with you.

322
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,020
Why are you taking this unnecessary risk?

323
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,860
Is Di Ziyuan

324
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,380
worth the sacrifice?

325
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,500
I am the heir of the Han family.

326
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,260
I will own up mistakes my family made

327
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,740
and atone

328
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,020
for their sins.

329
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,850
Whether Ziyuan is worth my sacrifice or not,

330
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,370
that will be decided
by our subjects in the future.

331
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,370
Why are you doing this, Your Highness?

332
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,090
Our nation is in peril.

333
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,020
Our enemy is at our doorstep.

334
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,850
I am a man of Jing.

335
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,850
I fight.

336
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,020
Even if Ziyuan was out of the picture,

337
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,090
I would still be here to fight my enemy

338
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
to my death.

339
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:37,980
Oh, no.

340
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,900
The Northern Qin men
walked over their fallen brothers

341
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,660
and charged in.

342
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,900
Those madmen.

343
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,980
All right then.

344
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,370
At your command, Your Highness.

345
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,770
Charge!

346
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
Prince of Northern Qin, Mo Bei.

347
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,130
I have been waiting for you.

348
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,500
Han Ye.

349
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,130
Why are you here?

350
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,980
Di Ziyuan isn't in Qingnan City?

351
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,740
You lied to me.

352
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,090
It's the oldest trick in the book.

353
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,260
To scale this mountain,

354
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,500
I lost 30% of my men.

355
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,130
If I can't kill Di Ziyuan,

356
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,130
I'll just make do with your life.

357
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,370
Take it if you can.

358
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,850
The Plum Blossom Agents?

359
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,500
The Jing State even deployed

360
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,500
its own secret forces

361
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,460
to ambush me.

362
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,370
It seems like both our nations

363
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,770
have played the trump card.

364
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,460
You're mistaken.

365
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,130
The much stronger Di Troops are not here yet.

366
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,460
There are only my men

367
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,130
on this mountain today.

368
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,460
And we are enough

369
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,460
to avenge Anning.

370
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,900
Arrogant fools.

371
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,500
Wipe them out!

372
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,370
Charge!

373
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,770
He planned

374
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,130
around your safety.

375
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,530
It was his plan to use the letter

376
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,290
to lure me here too?

377
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,530
Han Ye is...

378
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,130
-Young Lady.
-Young Lady.

379
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,090
Han Ye.

380
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,020
Eat this.

381
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,660
Using poison?

382
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,530
You're shameless.

383
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,460
You are a skilled fighter,

384
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,900
but you're nothing without your vision.

385
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:50,900
Your Highness!

386
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,050
Your Highness!

387
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,900
You think the Plum Blossom Agents

388
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,130
can trap me here?

389
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,220
Whoever kills the Crown Prince of Jing

390
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,610
will be promoted three ranks above
and awarded a thousand gold taels.

391
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,290
Shoot!

392
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,330
Don't just stand there.

393
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,530
Attack!

394
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,940
Your Highness.

395
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:39,940
Your Highness!

396
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,850
Han Ye.

397
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,940
This ambush was meant for Di Ziyuan.

398
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,770
(I'm glad Ziyuan doesn't have to)

399
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,980
(suffer this.)

400
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,610
Your Highness.

401
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:15,850
Your Highness.

402
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,900
Wen Shuo.

403
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,460
How many people do we have left?

404
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:21,660
Your Highness,

405
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,740
not many.

406
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,180
But your plan worked.

407
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,610
The Northern Qin Army was defeated.

408
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,610
Only Lengbei and his hundred-odd men remain.

409
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,610
Your Highness,

410
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,740
we turned the tide

411
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,500
thanks to your strategy.

412
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,570
Hang in there.

413
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,530
Capture Han Ye alive.

414
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,740
I'll use him to negotiate

415
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,530
with the Jing State for some land.

416
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,050
Advance if you dare.

417
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,700
Come!

418
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,900
Let's see how long

419
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,500
you can last.

420
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,810
Wen Shuo, go.

421
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,090
We have achieved our goal.

422
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,570
The threat of Northern Qin is no more.

423
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,180
We're now stuck

424
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,330
in a stalemate with Lengbei and his men.

425
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,900
And the only thing they can have now

426
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,530
is my life.

427
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,180
No, I won't leave you.

428
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,330
I won't let them hurt you.

429
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,810
I

430
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,700
have been

431
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,090
waiting for this moment for a long time.

432
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,660
The fate of Anning and me

433
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,290
was predestined

434
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,370
the moment the Di Troops

435
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,530
died in Qingnan Mountain.

436
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,130
Even our death

437
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,370
cannot redeem it.

438
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,460
No.

439
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,370
Your Highness.

440
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,770
Your Highness, you're not going to die.

441
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,980
Fetch a message to Ziyuan for me, please.

442
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,700
Tell her

443
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,530
that my dream

444
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,050
is to see

445
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,050
a peaceful and harmonious

446
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,900
Jing State.

447
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,290
Ask her to witness it on my behalf.

448
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,770
No, you'll tell Ziyuan all that yourself.

449
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,220
You'll do it yourself.

450
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,900
(Han Ye.)

451
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,980
(Why did you have to do this?)

452
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,290
Lengbei.

453
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,610
To kill Ziyuan, you exhausted all your men.

454
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,980
You are hardly a threat now.

455
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,660
It's a shame
that I couldn't kill you to avenge Anning.

456
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,770
But I'm the Crown Prince of Jing.
You will not capture me.

457
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,700
Because I would rather die

458
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,460
than surrender

459
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,700
to my enemy!

460
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,610
Your Highness!

461
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,570
No!

462
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,050
Your Highness!

463
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:06,900
Your Highness!

464
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,090
Your Highness!

465
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,570
Your Highness...

466
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,180
Your Highness!

467
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,460
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

468
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,570
Your Highness.

469
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,370
Your Highness.

470
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,660
Your Highness, this is bad.

471
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,290
Di Ziyuan and her army are here.

472
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,330
Retreat!

473
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,570
Retreat!

474
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,370
Wen Shuo.

475
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,500
Where is Han Ye?

476
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,850
He...

477
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,090
He jumped off the cliff.

478
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,850
What?

479
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,330
His Highness was shot before he made the leap.

480
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,020
One arrow hit his vital.

481
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,810
He knew he wasn't long for this world,

482
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,370
so he jumped to his death

483
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,500
instead of letting

484
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,810
the Northern Qin

485
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,090
defile his body.

486
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,610
His Highness

487
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,050
is dead.

488
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,370
He was shot?

489
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,610
An arrow hit his vital?

490
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,330
Han Ye is dead?

491
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,980
No way.

492
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,460
He promised to clear my family's name.

493
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,460
I protected the world.

494
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,050
I protected the people.

495
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,940
If he's dead,
who's going to share the joy with me?

496
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,290
This can't be it.

497
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,290
Ziyuan.

498
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,220
Official Di,

499
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,810
His Highness used his life

500
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,570
to save yours.

501
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,530
He did

502
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,530
everything he could.

503
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,180
He wanted you to live.

504
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,530
I don't need anyone's protection!

505
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,570
He owes me an explanation.

506
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,180
So many people from my family died in vain.

507
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,050
Does he think his life

508
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,810
is enough to make amends?

509
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,980
-Official Di.
-Ziyuan.

510
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:47,730
Official Di.

511
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,220
Ziyuan.

512
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,290
Let go of me!

513
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:49,940
Ziyuan.

514
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,980
-Let go!
-Official Di.

515
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,290
Let go of me.

516
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,700
Ziyuan, I'm Di Jinyan.

517
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,770
Ziyuan.

518
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,420
I'm Di Jinyan.

519
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,660
I'm your younger brother.

520
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,490
I'm Di Jinyan.

521
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:13,970
(Ziyuan.)

522
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,250
You're not alone.

523
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,940
You get along with Wen Shuo, don't you?

524
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,690
He is fond of you too.

525
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,250
You can view him as your little brother.

526
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,180
Ziyuan.

527
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,340
Don't leave me.

528
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,340
You are

529
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:33,940
Jinyan?

530
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,250
His Highness asked me to tell you

531
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,900
that his dream

532
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,100
was to see a peaceful and harmonious

533
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:48,970
Jing State.

534
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,900
He entrusted this world to you

535
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,940
and hoped

536
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,770
that you would witness
the prosperity of this realm

537
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,620
on his behalf.

538
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,860
Han Ye...

539
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,820
Han Ye.

540
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,300
Han Ye!

541
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,500
Han Ye...

542
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,980
Han Ye...

543
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,180
Yuanqin.

544
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,860
What brought you here?

545
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,140
How is Ziyuan doing?

546
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,660
Young Lady kept to herself inside the tent.

547
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,140
She refuses to see anyone.

548
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,380
She is grieving.

549
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,860
She won't dwell on it, I'm sure.

550
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,740
She just needs some time.

551
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,140
I know you're sad too.

552
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,500
But you need to eat something.

553
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
Take a few bites.

554
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,860
Okay?

555
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,500
Thank you, Yuanqin.

556
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,220
Leave it there.

557
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
I'll eat it later.

558
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,700
Yuanqin,

559
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,620
I keep wondering

560
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,620
if things would be better

561
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,740
if I were the one

562
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,540
who jumped off the cliff.

563
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,940
His Highness and Ziyuan worked so hard
throughout their lives.

564
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,980
It shouldn't have ended like this.

565
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,220
Wen Shuo...

566
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,020
It's okay.

567
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,140
I know what you're about to say.

568
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I'm fine.

569
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,660
Don't worry about me.

570
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,900
