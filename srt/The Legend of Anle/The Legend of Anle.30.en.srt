[Episode 30]

25
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,300
You're here.

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,390
Are you injured?

27
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,780
It's not serious.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,340
Come on.

29
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,300
Have a seat.

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,340
The prison is shabby.

31
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,470
You'll have to endure it for several days.

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,070
I will get you out as soon as possible.

33
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,510
Even as a princess,

34
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,300
you have endured hardships on the border.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,990
So why can't I, as your brother,

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,700
bear simple meals?

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,580
Why did you publicly kill
the Grand Chancellor of the Left?

38
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,950
Can't you even tell me the reason?

39
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,180
Anning,

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,180
you've done enough for Jing.

41
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,270
Don't get into the troubled waters again.

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,510
Listen to me.

43
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,790
Leave the capital as soon as possible.

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,900
Go somewhere that makes you happy.

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,700
How can I not be concerned about you?

46
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,790
You protected me when we were young.

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,990
Now, it's my turn to protect you.

48
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,420
I'm glad to see that you're all grown up.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,700
But being born into the imperial family
comes with many constraints.

50
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,460
Not everything can be achieved by effort alone.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,620
I understand you.

52
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,350
But carrying such a heavy secret alone,

53
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,510
I understand even more.

54
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,180
Ye,

55
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,700
we are siblings.

56
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,270
If you wish to confide in someone one day,

57
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,420
I'll always be there for you.

58
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,020
All right.

59
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,390
Go now.

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,990
Go.

61
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,510
Anning,

62
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,390
don't do anything against His Majesty.

63
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,550
As the ruler of a nation,

64
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,140
his helplessness is even greater than ours.

65
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,710
Don't worry.

66
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,550
I know what to do.

67
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,820
Ziyuan also hopes that you'll be safe.

68
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,420
So don't let her down.

(every time I have made up my mind)

72
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,260
(that I'd move on without hesitation?)

[Crown Prince's Residence]

74
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,670
So Wen Shuo has been missing for a day and a night?

75
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,380
Yes,

76
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,670
he hasn't returned since last night.

77
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,230
If you want to save me,

78
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,860
Wen Shuo has something

79
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,110
that might be of use.

80
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,550
(First, it's the Grand Chancellor of the Left.)

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,110
(Then, it's Wen Shuo.)

82
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,110
Official Luo, you...

83
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,150
Han Ye has always been composed

84
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,990
and adhered to proper conduct since childhood.

85
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,030
What could have been the reason

86
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,940
for him to kill Jiang Yu

87
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,790
in front of the public in the capital?

88
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,230
And he did it without a moment's hesitation.

89
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,910
Not to mention, Wen Shuo,

90
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,990
who was always by his side, suddenly disappeared.

91
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,670
There must be a connection
between the two incidents.

92
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,910
After Mr. Wen's disappearance,

93
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,110
Qianyue Pavilion led to a thorough search

94
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,910
of Ren's Residence and its surroundings.

95
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,420
But he's nowhere to be found.

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,350
Han Ye,

97
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,990
the Grand Chancellor of the Left,

98
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,910
and Wen Shuo.

99
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,230
Why do I feel

100
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,110
this has something to do with Ziyuan?

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,150
[Ren's Residence]

102
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,860
Young Lady.

103
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,860
How did it go?

104
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,150
It's as you expected.

105
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,550
I did what you said

106
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,670
and infiltrated the Residence
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left.

107
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,670
I noticed the Grand Chancellor of the Left
is really fishy.

108
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,740
To my surprise,

109
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,150
I discovered a fake Plum Blossom Agent token.

110
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,900
[Plum]

111
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,860
So it was the Grand Chancellor of the Left.

112
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,110
I thought Gu Yunnian alone was evil.

113
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,590
But I didn't expect an old sly fox

114
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,790
like the Grand Chancellor of the Left
to be lurking in the dark.

115
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,790
He was not only sly.

116
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,670
While Gu Yunnian and we were plotting
against each other,

117
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,990
he was plotting against us.

118
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,550
Official Luo,

119
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,940
it's me, Yuanqin.

120
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,150
What brings you here at this late hour?

121
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,910
I might know some clues

122
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,910
about the incident involving
the Crown Prince and Mr. Wen.

123
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,420
Regarding the Wuliu Street incident back then,

124
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,790
people believed it was Wen Shuo
who saved the Crown Prince.

125
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,590
But in reality, it was the Crown Prince
who saved Wen Shuo.

126
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,910
But those people went crazy

127
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,820
and attacked me with their swords and knives.

128
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,740
To protect me,

129
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,790
His Highness took the blow for me.

130
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,300
Since you've come looking for me,

131
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,790
I assume you haven't informed Ziyuan
about this matter.

132
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,030
Yes.

133
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,350
Then, why did you tell me

134
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,790
and hide it from her?

135
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,670
Young Lady has suffered too much these years.

136
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,060
And now, she has finally

137
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,620
made up her mind to return to Jingnan.

138
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,150
I don't want to see her getting entangled
in the turmoil of the capital.

139
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,670
I believe

140
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,150
this is also what you wish.

141
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,230
Don't worry.

142
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,670
I will ensure she returns to Jingnan.

143
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,110
But with you and Yuanshu
accompanying her in the future,

144
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,710
it puts my mind at ease.

145
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,740
It's already late.

146
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,900
You should return before she gets worried.

147
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,110
Yes, sir.

148
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,430
Official Luo,

149
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,260
Mr. Wen Shuo's whereabouts are still unknown.

150
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,540
I'll leave his safety

151
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,230
to you, Official Luo.

152
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,990
Don't worry.

153
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,230
Linlang,

154
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,230
go and investigate what happened to Wen Shuo

155
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,950
at Wuliu Street back then.

156
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,780
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,780
(Are you really giving up?)

158
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,590
Your Highness,

159
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,900
every time I reach this point,
I can't make the next move anymore.

160
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,900
You are clearly making it difficult for me.

161
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,540
If you don't want to lose,

162
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,260
fight for it.

163
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,110
If you give up like this,

164
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,110
will you be truly content?

165
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,780
Your Highness,

166
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,110
I'll move the weiqi piece there.

167
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,990
I lost.

168
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,620
Your move

169
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,470
appears reckless, breaking into my setup.

170
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,660
But it's a grand and decisive move.

171
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,470
Not bad.

172
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,830
Your Highness,

173
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,430
you taught me before.

174
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,830
In battle, when we're on the brink of defeat,

175
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,990
we must increase our men's morale
to fight to the death.

176
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,950
We must not fear death or failure,
and only then can we achieve victory.

177
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,350
(I must find a way to escape.)

178
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,710
Sir.

179
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,500
How did the investigation go?

180
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,310
We still haven't found Mr. Wen.

181
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,710
But we found out about something else.

182
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,590
About the incident at Wuliu Street that year,

183
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,710
it was the Crown Prince who masterminded it.

184
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,950
It was not a coincidental encounter
as Yuanqin mentioned.

185
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,470
Actually,

186
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,660
there has always been one thing that puzzled me.

187
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,020
The Crown Prince is somewhat distant
from everyone else.

188
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,740
But he treats Wen Shuo

189
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,460
really differently.

190
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,260
He plays the role of an older brother and a father

191
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,500
and holds him dearly.

192
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,020
You're right.

193
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,770
Even so,

194
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,260
what does this have to do
with the Grand Chancellor of the Left?

195
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Why did Han Ye have to kill him?

196
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,170
[Yuchen Hall]

197
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,820
Greetings, Your Majesty.

198
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,340
Please take care of your health, Your Majesty.

199
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,580
Both of you and your brother

200
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,580
behave more reckless than the other.

201
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,220
How am I supposed to take care of my health?

202
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,700
I know why you're here.

203
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,220
But it's no use pleading with me

204
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,940
when it comes to this matter.

205
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,580
He killed someone in public.

206
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,980
And a high-ranking official of the court at that.

207
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,940
Even I cannot disregard
the laws of the country for this.

208
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,060
Your Majesty,

209
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,580
you know Ye's character the best.

210
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,700
Everything he does is for Jing

211
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,580
and the people.

212
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,100
He would never wantonly take an innocent life

213
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,580
or spare a treacherous person.

214
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,460
The Grand Chancellor of the Left
must have committed something grievous

215
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,860
for him to take such an action.

216
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,460
How can I not know what he's like?

217
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,340
He's my only Crown Prince.

218
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,340
I have invested

219
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,820
so much effort and care in him.

220
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,460
Come and have a seat.

221
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,220
Anning,

222
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,460
look at that.

223
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,580
All those petitions are from the ministers,

224
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,460
demanding severe punishment
for the Crown Prince.

225
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,220
If I were to let him off lightly,

226
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,980
it would be hard to quell
the discontentment of the people.

227
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,100
Unless he truthfully explains what happened

228
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,460
and gives a reasonable explanation,

229
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,940
even if I do protect him,

230
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,340
it will be difficult for him
to win the trust of the people

231
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,100
or make them submit

232
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,540
when he succeeds the throne.

233
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
Anning.

234
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,100
Even as the ruler,

235
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,060
there are things that I can't do.

236
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,580
Do you understand?

237
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,580
I understand.

238
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,460
It was my willfulness

239
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,460
that forced Grandmother to her death,

240
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,820
put you in a difficult position,

241
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,700
and led to Ye's imprisonment.

242
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,100
I am an unfilial child.

243
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,220
Anning,

244
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,860
you're not unfilial.

245
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,340
It's not your fault either.

246
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,740
You were born into this imperial family.

247
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,060
So there are too many things beyond your control.

248
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,940
For so many years,

249
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,940
I may scold you

250
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,740
for whatever you've done.

251
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,580
But I never stopped you.

252
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
That's because I wanted you

253
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,700
to be the happiest one

254
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,700
in this imperial family.

255
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,100
But I never expected

256
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,700
that in the end,

257
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,100
you have carried the most burden.

258
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,980
Anning,

259
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,940
remember.

260
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,460
Regardless of what's happening in the capital,

261
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,940
you've been guarding the border for so many years

262
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,860
to protect the country and the people.

263
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,900
You,

264
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,580
Anning,

265
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,980
are the pride of Jing and me.

266
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,500
[Ren's Residence]

267
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,700
[Plum]

268
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,580
It seems your previous concern
about the Grand Chancellor of the Left

269
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,220
was right.

270
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,820
He was the one who attempted
to assassinate Han Zhongyuan

271
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,860
at the palace's banquet.

272
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,460
Yes,

273
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,500
and he was also the one
who orchestrated the assassination attempt

274
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,820
on you and Han Ye at Huayuan Mountain.

275
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,700
It's a pity that Gu Yunnian,
who had been clever his entire life,

276
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,700
probably never knew

277
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,100
he had been a pawn in someone else's plot.

278
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,980
Speaking of this, assassinating the Emperor
is already a capital offense.

279
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,220
If he reveals the truth to the world,

280
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,580
Han Ye killing him will be justified,

281
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,220
and there's no need to go through all this trouble.

282
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,380
You always say Han Ye's matters don't concern you.

283
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,340
But deep down, you still care about him.

284
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,820
I simply don't want these treacherous people

285
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,980
to have control of the court.

286
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,100
As long as these corrupt officials remain,

287
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,340
the people will never have peace.

288
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,340
You're starting to sound more and more like him.

289
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,340
According to Qianyue Pavilion's investigation,

290
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,180
most of the crimes that Gu Yunnian committed

291
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,500
were orchestrated
by the Grand Chancellor of the Left,

292
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,380
who was using Gu Yunnian as a tool to kill.

293
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
No wonder.

294
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,940
That explains

295
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,460
why we couldn't find clear evidence before.

296
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,700
The problems all led
to the Grand Chancellor of the Left.

297
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,580
If this is the case,

298
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,980
Han Ye could have presented
the evidence directly

299
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,580
to Han Zhongyuan.

300
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,980
Why did he have to kill people in public?

301
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,460
Ziyuan,

302
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,700
let the Ministry of Justice handle this.

303
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
So don't concern yourself with this.

304
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
I've heard

305
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
many officials in the court

306
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,580
want to impeach the Crown Prince.

307
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Don't worry.

308
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,340
Han Ye won't be alone in the court.

309
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,820
Ziyuan,

310
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,220
I don't want you

311
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,220
to get involved in this matter.

312
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,100
Of course, this is Han Ye's wish too.

313
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,460
Your master was killed on the street.

314
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,460
You can't even watch a kid?

315
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,020
Are you all that useless?

316
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,980
Your Highness,

317
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,740
we have no one to lead us now.

318
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,420
The only person we can trust
in this capital is you.

319
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,820
After the death
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left,

320
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,900
many of our plans will be disrupted.

321
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,020
It seems that Luo Mingxi and Ren Anle
have discovered something.

322
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
Our identities will be exposed soon.

323
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,660
The Crown Prince's public killing

324
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
is an unheard-of event.

325
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,860
Han Zhongyuan

326
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,500
is probably having a headache

327
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,940
in trying to suppress it.

328
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,860
Your Highness, rest assured.

329
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,460
Our people will continue to submit memorials,

330
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,900
urging severe punishment for the Crown Prince.

331
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,180
Spread the news

332
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,820
that the Crown Prince killed
for the sake of the Di family.

333
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,340
We must drive Han Zhongyuan into a corner.

334
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,380
This way,

335
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,820
the court of Jing will be even more chaotic.

336
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,900
Yes, Your Highness.

337
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,740
[Yuchen Hall]

338
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,900
Everyone is pushing me.

339
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,860
I've had it with these memorials!

340
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,660
Your Majesty, please calm down.

341
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,500
Don't let this hurt your health.

342
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,340
The Crown Prince was too impulsive.

343
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,420
Look what happened now.

344
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,100
The court is in chaos.

345
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,340
Some want me to punish him,

346
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
while some want me to protect him.

347
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,260
It's tiring

348
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,420
to see them argue all day long!

349
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,340
Your Majesty,

350
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,580
have some tea.

351
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,940
I don't care

352
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,100
what motive the Crown Prince has.

353
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,660
He shouldn't have killed Jiang Yu
in front of everyone like that.

354
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,020
Now look at what happened.

355
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,660
Even if I want to protect him,

356
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,940
I can't do anything now!

357
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,020
Your Majesty,

358
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,180
all the officials are requesting
your fair judgment.

359
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
Fair judgment, you say?

360
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,860
These officials

361
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,500
can only see the law before them

362
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,940
but fail to see the bigger picture.

363
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,580
I have only one Crown Prince,

364
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,340
and Jing has only this one heir to the throne.

365
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,340
How can the case be handled
like it's an ordinary case?

366
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,540
Your Majesty,

367
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,340
Official Luo Mingxi
is actively investigating this case.

on New Year's Eve and at Huayuan Mountain

were plotted by the Grand Chancellor of the Left.

370
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,860
[Luo Mingxi, Minister of Justice]
It turns out the rumors

371
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,420
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left's
treason are true.

372
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,900
In this case,

373
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,660
the Crown Prince killing Jiang Yu in public

374
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,100
is reasonable.

375
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

376
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,580
What did the officials say?

377
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,020
Some of the officials

378
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,300
expressed their agreement,

379
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,260
while some think

380
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,180
that if we handle this matter lightly,

381
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,340
it'll set a precedent.

382
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,100
Then, if someone kills anyone

383
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,020
and regards it as a punishment for treason,

384
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,420
Jing will be in chaos.

385
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,340
They have a point.

386
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,180
Even if Jiang Yu is guilty,

387
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,500
he should be judged
by the Three Monitoring Offices.

388
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Moreover, the Crown Prince is in charge
of the Three Judicial Offices.

389
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,940
He should not break the law
or act beyond the limits.

390
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,300
Relying solely on Luo Mingxi's testimony

391
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,940
won't be enough to quell the public's doubts.

392
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,860
Your Majesty,

393
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,340
it's also rumored

394
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,900
that the Crown Prince
killed the Grand Chancellor of the Left himself

395
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,740
because of the Di family.

396
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,860

This incident has caused quite a stir in the city.

People can't help but talk about it.

398
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,740
Convey my order

399
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,340
and tell Luo Mingxi
to continue his investigation.

400
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,580
Once he finds solid evidence,

401
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,580
report it back to me.

402
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,580

it's time for your acupuncture.

406
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,740
I'll do it after I return. I'm going out.

407

Where are you going?

408
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,940
The ministers are pressuring Han Zhongyuan

to find all the evidence
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left's treason

410
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,740
and the Crown Prince's motive for killing him
within three days.

411
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,900
There is concrete evidence
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left's treason.

412
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,340
The Crown Prince has earned
the trust of His Majesty

413
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,100
and has gained the favor of the officials.

414
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,500
Why would there be officials
remonstrating at this time?

415
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,100
Those were once influenced
by the Grand Chancellor of the Left.

416

But for them to speak up now,

417
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,860
there must be someone instigating them.

418
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Perhaps this person

419
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,500
is the one hiding in the shadows

420

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
do you still remember the candidate
the Grand Chancellor of the Left recommended

453
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,900
for the Crown Princess selection?

454
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
It was the Princess of Northern Qin.

00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,060
Young Lady,

456
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,780
are you saying
the Grand Chancellor of the Left is...

457
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,820
The Grand Chancellor of the Left, Jiang Yu,
is somehow related to the Northern Qin.

458
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,060
(Now, there's evidence
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left's treason.)

459
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,300
(But how is he related to Wen Shuo?)

460
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,860
(What secrets does Wen Shuo hold?)

461
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,620
Regarding the Wuliu Street incident back then,

462
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,900
people believed it was Wen Shuo
who saved the Crown Prince.

463
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,580
But in reality, it was the Crown Prince
who saved Wen Shuo.

00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,420
About the incident at Wuliu Street that year,

465
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,420
it was the Crown Prince who masterminded it.

466
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,580
The Crown Prince is somewhat distant
from everyone else.

467
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,420
But he treats Wen Shuo differently.

468
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,100
He plays the role of an older brother and a father

469
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,260
and holds him dearly.

470
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,700
(Why did the Crown Prince purposely arrange)

471

(to bring Wen Shuo into his residence?)

472
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,580
The Grand Chancellor of the Left wanted
to use my identity as the Di family's descendant

to get in touch with the old servants
of the Di family.

is those people

It took him 20 years to climb the ranks

recruited talents widely.

His mother was actually from Northern Qin.

549
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,860
I'll search the Residence
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left.

550
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,020
I'm sure we'll find

551
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,620
some information on his conspiracy
with the Northern Qin.

552
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
Take good care of Wen Shuo.

553
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,020
(Han Ye,)

554
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,740
(we'll definitely get you out of prison.)

555
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,860
What happened?

556
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,940
Luo Mingxi raided the Residence
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left

557
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,340
and found a lot of things during the search.

558
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,380
That includes...

559
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,780
That includes the intelligence
we obtained from the Northwest.

560
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,860
So, if that's the case, it means

561
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,020
Luo Mingxi can claim to everyone

562
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
that the Grand Chancellor of the Left
was leaking information at that time.

563
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,180
And the reason the Crown Prince
killed him on the street

564
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,780
was to prevent the information from leaking out.

565
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,100
They have managed to turn things in their favor.

566
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,860
Since his identity is already exposed,

567
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,420
we have to abort the plan

568
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,860
to use the former Di's servants.

569
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,900
Go and handle the aftermath.

570
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,260
Tell our men not to act rashly.

571
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,860
Yes, Your Highness.

572
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,500
Also,

573
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,940
gather all the pieces
of intelligence we've obtained

574
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,100
and deliver them back to Northern Qin.

575
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,420
We'll launch the uprising in the Northwest
ahead of time.

576
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,500
Yes, Your Highness.

577
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,900
[By Luo Mingxi, Minister of Justice]
Official Luo has already confirmed

578
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,660
that Jiang Yu's mother is from the Northern Qin

579
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,580
and Jiang Yu is a spy from Northern Qin.

580
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,100
Over the years,

581
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,900
he had been conspiring with the Northern Qin

582
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,020
and leaking Jing's confidential information
multiple times.

583
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,580
The Crown Prince knew about this.

584
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,260
That's why he publicly killed Jiang Yu.

585
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,860
Jiang Yu's actions

586
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,420
had caused great harm to Jing over the years.

587
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,180
His crime is truly heinous and grave.

588
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,500
Even his death is not enough
to atone for his crime!

589
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,260
Your Majesty, please calm down.

590
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,580
Jiang Yu deserved to die for his crimes.

591
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,900
And the Crown Prince did a righteous act

592
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,500
by killing a traitor

593
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,740
and safeguarding the country's interests.

594
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,100
The Crown Prince is innocent
and has rendered meritorious deeds.

595
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,780
Zhao Fu.

596
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:44,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

597
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,100
Convey my order

598
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,740
to release the Crown Prince

599
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,340
and submit the evidence of Jiang Yu's crimes

600
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,100
to the Court of Judicial Review.

601
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,860
Issue the imperial decree as soon as possible

602
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,180
and inform the people.

603
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

604
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,260
Wait.

605
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,020
Convey my oral decree to Anning

606
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,260
to investigate

607
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,340
the military situation in the Northwest border.

608
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,740
[Prison]

610
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,860
Your Highness!

611
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,500
Ye.

612
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,740
Your Highness,

613
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
you must have suffered.

614
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,660
Do you crave anything?

615
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,860
I'll make them for you at the residence.

616
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,740
I'm all right.

617
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,500
How can you say that
when you've lost so much weight?

618
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,940
I'm really fine.

619
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,500
But you,

620
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,860
I heard

621
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,100
you escaped on your own.

622
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,180
Little brat,

623
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,020
my teachings didn't go in vain.

624
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,860
Of course,

625
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,580
I grew up beside you.

626
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,940
What's wrong?

627
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,740
Nothing.

628
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,740
Let's go.

629
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,180
These days,

630
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,500
you've been exhausting yourself

631
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,580
over the Crown Prince's matters.

632
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,900
The things I've done

633
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,740
are nothing

634
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,500
compared to what Han Ye did

635
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,820
for Ziyuan back then.

636
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,740
Why belittle yourself like this?

637
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,820
Back then, it was you

638
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,500
who saved Miss Di from imprisonment
in Dai Mountain.

639
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,820
It was also you

640
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,620
who paved the way for her to the capital
for the past ten years.

641
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,580
But ten years ago,

642
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,460
when the imperial decree
was issued to execute the Di family,

643
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,700
everyone's eyes
were on the Crown Prince's Residence.

644
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,980
Because with just one imperial decree,

645
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,460
the Crown Prince
saved the orphaned girl of the Di family.

646
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,100
It was a high-profile incident,

647
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,380
and anything he did would attract attention.

648
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,940
But even so,

649
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,220
he still did it.

650
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,780
I remember the rumors at the time saying

651
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,700
that Di Jinyan died from illness
in the Crown Prince's Residence.

652
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,060
That's right.

653
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,860
But one year later,

654
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,380
Han Ye made a dead person come back to life.

655
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,300
And he even kept him by his side

656
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,500
in front of the whole world.

657
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,700
I can't be compared

658
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,620
to his strategies and courage.

659
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,540
But you also turned Di Cheng'en

660
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
into Di Ziyuan back then.

661
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,460
That's different.

662
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,020
I couldn't do what he did,

663
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,620
bringing back a dead person to life.

664
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,300
Thinking about it,

665
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,660
when the Crown Prince saved Wen Shuo back then,

666
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,900
he was only in his teens.

667
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,540
Yes,

668
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,060
and at that young age,

669
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
he had already done so much for Ziyuan.

670
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,340
Your Highness.

671
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,300
Your Highness,

672
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,260
eat this quickly.

673
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I'm sure you didn't eat well

674
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,460
while you were in prison.

675
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,420
You must eat more.

676
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,100
It looks like
although you were kidnapped by bad guys,

677
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,900
you were still concerned
about improving your cooking skills.

678
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,820
No, I wasn't.

679
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,660
I was clearly concerned about you.

680
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,100
Your Highness,

681
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,340
have some hot tea.

682
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,860
I've spent hours simmering this chicken soup.

683
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,340
Try it.

684
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,260
I was only locked up for several days.

685
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,980
You're overly caring.

686
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,180
Your Highness.

687
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,540
You may be locked up for several days.

688
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,300
But to me,

689
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,380
it felt like years.

690
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,060
If it weren't for me...

691
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,100
If Jiang Yu hadn't kidnapped me,

692
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,820
you wouldn't have killed him on the street.

693
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,340
This matter has nothing to do with you.

694
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,140
Before you were kidnapped,

695
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,740
I obtained evidence

696
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,340
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left's crimes
from Luo Mingxi.

697
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,180
He captured you to control me.

698
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,300
But since he had involved himself
with the Northwestern Army,

699
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,980
I must eliminate him.

700
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,340
That day,

701
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,380
I was captured

702
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,540
and confined in a small room.

703
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,180
I could hear,

704
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,420
but I was gagged.

705
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,180
I could move,

706
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,980
but I couldn't leave.

707
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,580
At that time, I really thought

708
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,220
I was going to die there.

709
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,860
When my thoughts started getting blurry,

710
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,820
I thought of you.

711
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,180
I may be an orphan.

712
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,340
But I never thought

713
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,100
I was alone in this world.

714
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,020
You taught me and raised me.

715
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,380
You protected and nurtured me.

716
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,980
I will remember everything you've done for me.

717
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,860
I am deeply grateful to you
from the bottom of my heart.

718
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,500
Silly kid,

719
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,300
why are you saying all this?

720
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,380
Your Highness,

721
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,180
I just wanted to say,

722
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,780
please don't let anything happen to you,

723
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,580
especially because of me.

724
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,500
Or else I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life.

725
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,460
Enough said.

726
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,180
Your Highness, please eat.

727
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,220
I'll serve them for you.

728
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,300
The dishes are still hot and fresh.

729
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,540
This one too.

730
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,340
And this.

731
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,380
Try them out.

732
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,540
(Ziyuan,)

733
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,260
(Jinyan has grown up)

734
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
(and is doing well.)

735
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,580
(Please rest assured.)

736
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,100
(Once I find a suitable opportunity,)

737
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,580
(I will hand him over to you.)

738
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,220
Linlang,

739
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,540
I still haven't told Ziyuan

740
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,940
that Wen Shuo

741
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,780
is Di Jinyan.

742
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,740
I'm sure you did it

743
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,580
for a reason.

744
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,540
It was nothing but my selfishness

745
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,940
because I was afraid.

746
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,820
I was afraid that once...

747
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,460
she knew what Han Ye

748
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,580
has done for her over the years,

749
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,140
she would find it even harder to let go.

750
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,860
[Residence of the Princess]

751
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,540
General.

752
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,820
Lengbei,

753
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,460
why do you look distracted?

754
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,740
I was just thinking

755
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,060
now that the matter with the Crown Prince

756
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,380
has been resolved successfully,

757
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,300
you can finally be at ease.

758
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,500
Yes,

759
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,700
Ye is now safe.

760
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,540
I can also return to the Northwest
with peace of mind.

761
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,940
But when I think of Jiang Yu,

762
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,500
who caused so much trouble in Jing over the years,

763
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,060
it feels like a thorn in my side.

764
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,180
The Northern Qin dared to infiltrate our court,

765
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,460
and who knows,

766
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,100
they might have even planted spies
right under my nose.

767
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,460
I will immediately investigate the remnants
of the Grand Chancellor of the Left in the capital.

768
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,540
We must not let people from Northern Qin
have any opportunities to strike again.

769
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,300
With Ye and Official Luo in the capital,

770
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,300
I don't have to worry about that.

771
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,180
But I can't delay my return

772
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,940
to the Northwest anymore.

773
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,580
Once we've returned,

774
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,020
you must thoroughly investigate
the military camps.

775
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,180
Don't spare any one of them.

776
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,980
Yes.

777
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,820
I'm returning to the Northwest.

778
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,020
Ziyuan is also going back to Jingnan.

779
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,300
We'll be separated from now on again.

780
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,540
Lengbei,

781
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,260
so much has happened these days.

782
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,460
You didn't even come to see me.

783
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,780
I've been worried sick.

784
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,580
Lengbei,

785
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,980
is the Crown Prince safe now?

786
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,020
He's fine.

787
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,980
I'm glad to hear that.

788
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,980
By the way,

789
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,740
was the Grand Chancellor of the Left
really from Northern Qin?

790
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,420
Since he was killed by the Crown Prince in public,

791
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,340
would I...

792
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,220
