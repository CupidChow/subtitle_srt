My imperial court

And yet, you are here congratulating me.

27

Eighty thousand generals and soldiers
died tragically,

28
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,180
and the loyal Di family
endured ten years of unfair suffering.

29
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,180
These tragedies indeed happened

30
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,540
because of the Han family's selfish desires.

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,020
Since the scholars are willing
to ask us to uphold justice,

their trust in Jing,

and they believe that Your Majesty

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,860
will clear the Di family's name

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,180
and bring justice to the whole country.

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm just telling the truth.

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,420
Your Majesty, you are wise

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,900
and always open to advice.

42
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,500
You also taught me
that people's hearts are important.

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,860
Like these scholars,

44
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,820

will stop the endless rumors

have already paid for their actions
with their lives.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,820
The Di family's case should also come to an end.

59

are still wandering
at Qingnan Mountain in the Northwest.

62

I beg Your Majesty to personally go

63

and bring back the 80,000 heroic souls
to the capital

64

that His Majesty go to the Northwest border

68
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,060
I find it highly inappropriate.

69

The Emperor's well-being is of utmost importance.

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,220
His Majesty shouldn't travel strenuously.

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,620
You're the only one he listens to now.

187

Don't worry.

188
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,740
Thank you, Miss Di.

189
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,620
I know you have a perceptive heart.

190
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
But you can check these ledgers at any time.

191

Ziyuan,

192
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,980
you have something to tell me, right?

193
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,220
Are you planning something?

194
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,740
Are you

195
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,860
not content?

196
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,780
I'm just worried

197
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,860
because I was imprisoned
as soon as the Di family case was exonerated.

198
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,380
It looks like the Han family
will eventually make a move against you.

199
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,460
I was once reluctant to leave the court.

200
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,580
But you personally stopped me.

201
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,580
Now, Han Zhongyuan

202
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,420
issued a repentance decree before the people.

203

The 80,000 loyal souls

204
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,460
will be brought back from Qingnan Mountain soon.

205
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,140
You were right at the time.

206
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,220
I shouldn't continue this fight here.

207
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,180
I said that back then

208
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,460
because I wanted you to be free
from the Han family's court responsibilities.

209
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,580
You, the Di family's bloodline,
are destined to be feared

210
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,380
by the Han family.

211
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,060
If you don't take a step forward

212
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,340
to counterbalance the Han family,

213
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,100
I think

214
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,100
the tragedy of the Di family

215
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,620
won't end here.

216
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,620
You were injured severely in prison.

217
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,940
You should rest properly for these few days.

218
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,860
I'll come and visit you again

219
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,260
after I return from the Northwest.

Ye,

223
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,380
why are you here?

224
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,260
I know you've been troubled lately,

225
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,220
so I brought

226

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,260
Only you know me.

You know my taste like the back of your hand.

230

When I saw you lacking in energy these days,

231
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,500
I thought

232
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,220
my dear sister was going

233
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,220
to need some treats from me to comfort her

234
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,100
like when we were young.

235
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,980
Anning,

236
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,860
you're a stubborn person.

237
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,380
I was worried
that you would get hurt in the capital.

238
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,220
But seeing you

239
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,740
not dwelling in self-pity,

240
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
I'm relieved.

241
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,860
Since we were young,

242
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,740
you've always cared for me the most.

243
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,740
In this world,

what older brother wouldn't worry
about their younger sister?

245
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,260
Moreover, as members of the imperial family,

246
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,220
we face countless helplessness

247
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,500

I'll bear it for you.

252
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,740
However, from now on,

253
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,980
you mustn't keep anything

254

from me.

of the 80,000 souls.

No matter how well I do,

by this matter

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,340
Thanks to your acupuncture these days

369
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,820
that my complexion looks normal.

370
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
Thank you for your help.

371
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,020
The time has arrived!

372
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,540
The Crown Prince

373
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,540
and Official Di, please set out to receive

374
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,020
the 80,000 heroic souls of the Di family
and escort them back to the capital!

375
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,780
-I shall obey the decree.
-I shall obey the decree.

376
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,420
[Jiaxian Gate]

377
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,500
Your Highness,

378
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
the carriage is ready.

379
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,500
Please set out with Official Di.

380
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,860
Yuanshu,

381
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,100
prepare another carriage for me.

382
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
I will join you later.

383
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,260
All right.

384
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,860
Wait.

385
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,100
Official Di, if you don't mind,

386
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,020
you can take my carriage.

387
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,580
I'll prepare another carriage
and catch up with the envoy.

388
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,500
Your Highness,

389
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,820
it's an important occasion.

390
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
As the Crown Prince...

391
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,700
No problem.

392
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,580
We can't have the Crown Prince

393
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,020
give up his carriage for other people.

394
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,260
Official Di, please ride with me.

395
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,780
Luo Mingxi and Di Ziyuan
are traveling in the same carriage.

396
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,540
They will cross
through dense forests along the way.

397
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,020
This is the perfect opportunity to take action.

398
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,820
The Chancellor
requests Your Highness to lend us a hand.

399
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,260
Do you have any news on winning the trust

400
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,500
of the former servants of the Di family?

401
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,460
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

402
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,300
We have already obtained some clues.

403
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,260
Why did you come?

404
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,340
Didn't you promise to recuperate at home?

405
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,780
As a former member of the Di family,

406
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,580
those buried at Qingnan Mountain
were my seniors.

407
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,100
Of course, I must see them off.

408
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,980
But it's a long journey.

409
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,700
What if your body can't take it?

410
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,780
I'll be fine.

411
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,820
Linlang has been taking care of me
for the past few days.

412
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,020
Look,

413
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,780
don't I look much better now
than when I was released from prison?

414
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
I still have to rely on your keen intuition

415
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,060
for this arduous journey.

416
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,780
You know the road ahead is tough.

417
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,860
You even prepared this spacious carriage for me.

418
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,500
Because I know

419
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
you don't want to face him.

420
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,180
This carriage has a cozy setup.

421
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,100
It comes with a warmer and soft blankets.

422
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,860
Your Highness,

423
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,260
you didn't prepare these for me, right?

424
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,060
You have done well in your studies recently.

425
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,780
So you deserve this reward.

426
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,260
Your Highness and I don't like drinking.

427
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,700
Then,

428
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,020
[Alcohol]
who did you prepare these for?

429
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,260
When we take a break midway,

430
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,580
you can take these two jars of wine

431
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,260
and deliver them to Official Luo's carriage.

432
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,740
The weather is changing,

433
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,580
and they might need it.

434
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,300
Your Highness asked me to do it

435
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,020
because you wanted to give something to Anle?

436
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,060
Never mind.

437
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,740
Official Luo is meticulous.

438
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,580
I suppose he's more thorough
in such preparation.

439
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,500
I don't hate him.

440
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,300
I just don't want to see him.

441
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
But I'm sure

442
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,500
he'll be a good Crown Prince

443
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,500
and treat the descendants
of the Di family with kindness.

444
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,060
Treat with kindness?

445
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,100
Do those wives and mothers,

446
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,860
who have experienced
the loss of husbands and sons,

447
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,500
deserve only a decree

448
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,780
and a small sum of money?

449
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,260
Is this what you call
treating them with kindness?

450
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,740
It seems like the sky is getting cloudy.

451
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,220
It might rain.

452
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,780
Ziyuan,

453
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,020
as a descendant of the Di family,

454
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,060
you should have the same determination
as the former family head

455
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,540
who wielded great power.

456
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,060
Your Highness, do you remember

457
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,860
when we traveled to Jiangnan,

458
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Anle insisted that we all
ride in the same carriage?

459
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,060
Actually,

460
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
she did that so you could rest peacefully.

461
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,500
She really cares for you.

462
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,740
Your Highness and Anle make a formidable team,

463
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,820
solving cases and getting rid of evildoers.

464
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,460
What a remarkable understanding.

465
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,060
When you held Anle's hand

466
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,740
amid the cheers of the people,

467
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,180
I couldn't help but envy.

468
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,500
You went through thick and thin together

469
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
and have a deep affection for each other.

470
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
Your bond is as strong as the one

471
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,460
the Founding Emperor had

472
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,300
with the head of the Di family.

473
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,780
Your Highness,

474
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,460
you clearly care deeply for Anle.

475
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,540
Since His Majesty
has issued the repentance decree

476
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,300
and agreed to welcome back
the generals and soldiers of the Di family,

477
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,260
why can't you two reconcile?

478
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,460
Because she has always been Di Ziyuan,

479
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,540
not Ren Anle.

480
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,780
I'd rather she be a female pirate from Jingnan,

481
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,780
even if she is rough, uncultured,
and bad in literature.

482
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,980
I'd rather the girl I once had in my heart

483
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,060
and cherished, Ren Anle,

484
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,300
can live as she wants.

485
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,780
Sometimes, I wish

486
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,980
Di Ziyuan never existed in this world.

487
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,820
But the funny part

488
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,540
was Di Ziyuan has always been here.

489
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,300
What doesn't exist

490
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,300
is Ren Anle I have in my heart.

491
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,740
Young Lady.

492
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,460
Official Luo.

493
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,940
The carriage's wheels are stuck in the mud.

494
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,140
It seems we can't continue forward for now.

495
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,220
It's raining heavily.

496
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,540
So the envoy needs to rest and regroup.

497
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,260
His Highness requests
that Miss Di and Official Luo

498
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,980
get off the carriage to take shelter
from the rain.

499
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,540
Find some strong guards to push the carriage.

500
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,740
I won't get off.

501
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,980
Young Lady,

502
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,020
the road is muddy.

503
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,980
The guards need to change
the rain covers of the carriage.

504
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,980
It's inconvenient to stay inside.

505
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
It's better to get off the carriage
and find shelter from the rain.

506
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,820
Let's get off.

507
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,220
You're soaking wet.

508
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,460
Official Luo,

509
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,740
the spring rain is chilly.

510
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,220
It's easy to catch a cold being splashed by it.

511
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,220
Ask Official Di to change her position slightly.

512
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,740
It's fine.

513
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,700
I think this rain will stop soon.

514
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,660
Since she's not willing to come,

515
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,380
why force her?

516
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,700
Your Highness,

517
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,380
the weather is too cold.

518
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,420
I'll go and get some clothes for you.

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,380
reminds me of when we were in Jingnan.

529
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,420
Yes,

530
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,420
it always rained when we were kids.

531
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
You used to take me running in the rain,

532
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,220
and we ended up covered with mud.

533
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,020
It's precisely the heavy rain

534
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,500

can we go back to Jingnan?

539
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,220
Ziyuan,

540
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,460
do you know what I was thinking

541
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,780
every time I heard cheerful sounds

542
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,980
outside the Lingxiang Pleasure House?

543
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,420
I was thinking
that the capital sure was a great place.

544
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
Talents gather here,

545
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940

you have guarded the border for many years

594
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,900

they once fought to defend.

00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,100
This is the greatest comfort and tribute
to all the heroic souls.

598
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,220
I want to request His Majesty to issue a decree

599
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,100
to treat the surviving former servants
of the Di family kindly.

600
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,300

heavy casualties ten years ago.

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Over these years,
I've been investigating in secret

606
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,700

607
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,580
Deliver this memorial to His Majesty

608
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,260

610
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,540
Your Highness,

611
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,740

613

614
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,260
ten years is really a long time.

615
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,620
Perhaps,

616
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,620
they have already started new lives.

617
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,100
Perhaps...

618
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,180
Luo Mingxi is right.

619
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,260

620
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,620
But as long as these people are still alive,

621
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,820
they won't find peace.

622
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,620
They don't even know

623
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,740
that their loved ones died thousands of li away

624
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,020
because of the imperial family's
desire for power and selfish gain.

625
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,780

630
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,500
the more I realize

631
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,300
that no matter how hard I try,

632
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,780

00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,140
as well as what I had experienced with her,

637
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,100
are too insignificant

638

640
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,180

643
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,620

644
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,220
tell him all that.

645
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,340
But there are some words

646
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,820
he should hear

647
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,700
even if it's ten or twenty years late.

648
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,780
You didn't just say them to him

649
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,700
but also to me.

650
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,180

Other than seeking justice and innocence,

653
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,580
you want them to return

656
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,500
Even if we return to Jingnan now

657
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,260

658
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,460
will the people of Jingnan

659
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,060
truly live in peace?

660
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,340
You bear the surname "Di",

661
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,060
and you should be the protector
of that land and its people.

662
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,580
But achieving greatness
often comes at the cost of countless lives.

663

665
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,100
there will be no other options.

666
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,740
Chaos will spread throughout the land,

667
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,300
and so will Jingnan.

668
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,700

innocent people to survive this?

670
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,180

671
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,660
the plight of those ordinary folks?

672
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,100
During the Han family's rule
for the past ten years,

673
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,700
corrupt officials
and oppressive officers reigned.

674

is not worthy of being the Emperor.

(While one's birth
may determine their family background,)

679
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,780

with enough effort,

681
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,260
one can definitely change their fate.

682
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,540
