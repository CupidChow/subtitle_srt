I'm glad that you're back.

192
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,840
Come.

193
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,720
Come. Slowly.

194
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,960
Come.

195
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,150
Be careful.

196
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,080
Here.

197
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,870
Sit down.

198
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't worry.

199
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,000
We'll surely find a way.

200
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,840
I'll definitely make sure your eyes are cured

201
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,240
even if I have to visit
all the famous physicians myself.

202
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

203
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,720
By the way,

204
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
have you visited Ziyuan?

205
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,080
There's no longer any need for us to meet again.

206
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,480
From now on,

207
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,120
if she stays in the capital,

208
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,870
she will be one of my subjects.

209
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,870
If not,

210
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
she will be one of my citizens.

211
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Crown Prince.

212
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,630
No matter what decisions you make,

213
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
I just hope

214
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,200
that you won't

215
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,120
regret them.

216
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,510
Your Highness,

217
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,750
are we heading to Crown Prince's Residence?

218
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,720
Bring me to Lingxiang Pleasure House.

219
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,870
I wish to see Luo Mingxi.

220
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes, Your Highness.

221
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,780
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

222
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,960
Miss, take a look.

223
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,000
The beginning of spring is still cold.

224
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,390
You must rest and recuperate.

225
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,840
Don't exhaust your mental energy too much.

226
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,910
You wouldn't have been this ill

227
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,840
if it weren't for me all these years.

228
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,480
Don't worry.

229
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,480
I'm fine.

230
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,720
The Di family and Jingnan

231
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,240
still have a long way to go.

232
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,240
You have to maintain your health.

233
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,870
I stayed undercover in the capital for ten years.

234
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,480
Now, my master is finally making a comeback.

235
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,720
I have to sponge off you.

236
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,600
You're a ready groom, you know?

237
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,870
Why are you trying to sponge off me?

238
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,510
I come from Jingnan.

239
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,120
Why should I choose ladies from the capital

240
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,600
when Jingnan has better ones?

241
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,910
Do you despise the ladies
in the capital that much?

242
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,510
That's right.

243
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,750
-I like ladies from Jingnan...
-Make way!

244
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,360
Be careful.

245
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
Okay. Thank you.

246
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What did you say just now?

247
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,390
Nothing.

248
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,240
I said

249
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,480
you should look after yourself.

250
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,870
Stop prioritizing other people.

251
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,750
Paper kites for sale!

252
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,870
It's sturdy, and it flies high!

253
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,960
Take a look!

254
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,390
Your Highness,

255
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,320
they're getting further away.

256
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,480
Should we catch up to them?

257
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,120
No need for that.

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,630
Let's head back.

259
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,120
Yes, Your Highness.

260
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,630
Ziyuan,

261
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
have you truly decided to stay here

262
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,360
and not return to Jingnan?

263
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,120
Yes.

264
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,480
All right, then.

265
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,070
I'll stay here too.

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,350
After all, I've been living here for some time.

267
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,110
I'm afraid I can't get used
to the environment back there.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,070
You don't need to see me off.

269
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll head back by myself.

270
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,310
Okay.

271
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,830
Your Highness.

272
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,480
What's the matter?

273
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,000
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Jian Song.

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,720
Jian Song?

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,310
Knowing Your Highness

276
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,200
makes everything worth it!

277
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,830
You're still alive?

278
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,400
Yes, Your Highness.

279
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,590
Back then, I fell off the cliff.

280
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,310
Luckily someone saved me.

281
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,350
That's how I managed to survive.

282
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,550
Your Highness.

283
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,070
Great.

284
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm glad that you're alive.

285
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,000
Your Highness, I came here today

286
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
to bring you to see someone.

287
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,400
Who is it?

288
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,310
It's my benefactor.

289
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,200
She's also the person who can treat your eyes.

290
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,200
Your Highness.

291
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,720
Mind the steps.

292
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,790
Greetings, Madam Di.

293
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,270
Have a seat.

294
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,270
Here.

295
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,960
Have some tea.

296
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,270
Thank you, Madam.

297
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,550
I might be able to do something

298
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,350
about your eyes.

299
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,790
Madam, you don't have to console me.

300
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,790
There's no need to be burdened by your thoughts.

301
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,790
We can talk about it after I treat your eyes.

302
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,750
Ziyuan has been looking for you.

303
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,270
Should I tell her that you're back?

304
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,590
Why?

305
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,880
I know what she'll do

306
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,350
if she knows that I'm back.

307
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,790
But Madam,

308
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I can no longer be the Crown Prince.

309
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,590
Not with this pair of eyes.

310
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,830
Han Ye,

311
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,350
do you plan to draw the line with Ziyuan

312
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,270
and remain hidden forever?

313
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,510
Yes.

314
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,350
Han Ye.

315
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,590
You and Ziyuan

316
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,200
shouldn't repeat our mistakes.

317
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,830
The empire of Jing needs her.

318
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,240
Besides, the Han family and Di family
still have grudges against each other.

319
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,880
My disappearance

320
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
will bring her the most benefit.

321
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,350
Just let

322
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,750
bygones be bygones.

323
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,880
Do you truly think so?

324
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,880
Yes.

325
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,590
However,

326
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,350
for Ziyuan's sake,

327
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,350
you jumped off the Qingnan Mountain.

328
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,160
Madam,

329
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,680
I didn't do that solely for her sake.

330
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,270
I also did so for Jing's sake.

331
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,200
You and Ziyuan have an unforgettable relationship.

332
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,350
Can you truly let it go?

333
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
She and I

334
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,270
have our own duties to uphold.

335
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,880
Both of us should start anew.

336
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,310
People

337
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,070
have to move on.

338
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,350
Fine.

339
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,350
You can live here for now.

340
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
I'll treat your eyes.

341
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,440
However,

342
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,310
it cannot be rushed.

343
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,790
Thank you, madam.

344
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,100
[Ren's Residence]

345
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,310
Young Lady,

346
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,200
everyone is saying

347
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,310
that His Highness is gone.

348
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,830
And they say that you're ruling over
the imperial court

349
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,680
due to your military strength.

350
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,400
They even said that you still hate the Han family

351
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,030
and that Jing will experience a revolution soon.

352
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,750
They only spout nonsense.

353
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,400
Young Lady!

354
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,550
Young Lady.

355
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,880
What's the matter?

356
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,790
His Highness has returned.

357
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,680
Where is he?

358
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,640
Hurry and bring me to him!

359
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,880
He's on Fuling Mountain.

360
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,880
But Young Lady,

361
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,790
I heard from the head of the Di family

362
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,750
that His Highness doesn't wish to see you.

363
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,160
He doesn't get to decide

364
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,310
if I get to see him or not.

365
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,590
Young Lady,

366
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
is that okay?

367
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,880
Yuanqin,

368
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,160
do I look pale?

369
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,200
Do I look frail?

370
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,880
What about my hair?

371
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,880
Not at all.

372
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,030
Young Lady, you are always beautiful.

373
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,110
All of you

374
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,110
have no respect for your elders.

375
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,880
You've been back for some time.

376
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,880
Are you sure you don't want to see her?

377
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,680
12 out of 13.

378
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,550
Madam,

379
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,310
you lost.

380
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,640
I lost?

381
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,310
This won't do.

382
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,110
I have to undo my move.

383
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,310
Madam,

384
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,880
you're undoing your move in front of a blind guy.

385
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,960
Don't you think you're being too sketchy?

386
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,960
It's your win, then.

387
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,070
Are you happy now?

388
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,920
Are you not willing to see her

389
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,790
because you're blind?

390
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,880
Han Ye,

391
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,960
she doesn't judge a book by its cover.

392
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,880
Why do you mind such details

393
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,550
like those laymen?

394
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,110
Madam, you have no idea.

395
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,350
Back then, she came to the capital

396
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,790
because of my handsome looks.

397
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,550
There are too many things

398
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,110
separating us right now.

399
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,790
Moreover, this isn't the right time
for us to meet.

400
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,550
If I see her now,

401
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,920
I'll only drag her into more troublesome affairs.

402
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,110
Who's there?

403
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,070
Who are you?

404
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,590
Your Highness,

405
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,750
the head of the Di family assigned
another servant to you

406
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,640
as I couldn't be here all the time.

407
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,160
Madam,

408
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,830
is she one of your servants?

409
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,590
Yes.

410
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
I did bring the lass here.

411
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,790
Hurry.

412
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,750
Make us another pot of tea.

413
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,510
Official Ren,

414
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,590
the water is boiling.

415
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,550
Has he been living on Fuling Mountain

416
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,960
ever since he came back?

417
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,550
That's right.

418
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,350
His Highness didn't allow me
to tell you about his return.

419
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,510
So he wants me to think that he's dead

420
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,270
even though he's alive?

421
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,350
I dare not make assumptions

422
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,550
regarding His Highness' thoughts.

423
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,640
Official Ren?

424
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,480
Well...

425
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,750
Official Ren,

426
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,880
what do you plan to do next?

427
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,640
Since you already said

428
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,790
that I was a servant assigned to him
by Di Shengtian,

429
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,680
naturally, I'll stay here.

430
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,350
But...

431
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
If His Highness finds out,

432
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,110
I will be...

433
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,880
Don't worry.

434
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,590
I won't let him find out.

435
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,790
But...

436
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,270
Anyone could tell that it's you

437
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
when you brew tea like that.

438
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,790
Madam,

439
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,880
I'm already used to living alone.

440
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,920
I don't need anyone else to serve me.

441
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,350
You need Jili to stand beside you

442
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,110
even when you play weiqi with me.

443
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,350
And you crack my tea cups

444
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,590
whenever you have tea.

445
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,960
Han Ye,

446
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,200
I don't have that many tea cups

447
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,070
for you to crack.

448
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,880
It's either

449
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,640
you let the lass serve you

450
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,790
or you leave.

451
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,310
However, let me make this clear.

452
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,920
If you leave,

453
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,590
I won't be able

454
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,550
to treat your eyes.

455
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,960
What's your name?

456
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,640
Your Highness,

457
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,110
she's a mute.

458
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,590
Zi.

459
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,960
Gui.

460
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,400
Leave.

461
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,350
Jili, you should leave too.

462
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,680
Your Highness,

463
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,750
the girl is crying.

464
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,510
She's trying to sign something.

465
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,830
If you

466
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,030
don't let her stay,

467
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,350
the head of the Di family will punish her.

468
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,550
All right. I understand.

469
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,030
Stop crying.

470
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,640
Both of you should leave.

471
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,270
I need some time alone.

472
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
Zigui?

473
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,200
Ziyuan, oh, Ziyuan.

474
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,510
The tea you make

475
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,160
is bitter and terrible.

476
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,640
Ziyuan.

477
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,350
Mingxi.

478
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm fine.

479
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
How's Han Ye doing?

480
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,270
He's doing fine.

481
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,070
It's just that he lost his vision.

482
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,350
If so, I won't visit him for now.

483
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,350
Bring me to Madam Di, then.

484
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,030
Great Aunt.

485
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
Brat, what are you doing here?

486
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,110
Madam Di.

487
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,590
Come, have a seat.

488
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,160
Great Aunt.

489
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,160
Luo Mingxi didn't come empty-handed.

490
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,430
[White Dew Tea from Xishan]

491
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,960
White Dew Tea from Xishan?

492
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,350
I don't think you're here to visit me.

493
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,510
You're here to visit Han Ye, aren't you?

494
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,960
The Crown Prince of Jing is in such a sorry state.

495
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
It's pointless to visit him.

496
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,030
If so, I won't stand on ceremony, then.

497
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,440
You haven't changed at all, huh?

498
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,160
This is no fun.

499
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,160
No fun at all.

500
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,270
By the way, Ziyuan,

501
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,350
how's your progress with Han Ye?

502
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,790
He's very stubborn.

503
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,830
He doesn't want me to stay.

504
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,070
He's very meticulous.

505
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,680
I assume he already found out that it was you.

506
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,310
I can stay here

507
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,590
as long as he doesn't expose me.

508
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,110
Aren't you afraid that
he'll use another method to chase you away?

509
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,160
For example, by making you suffer.

510
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,030
Him?

511
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
He's a gentleman.

512
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,030
He's not capable of anything harmful in nature.

513
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,790
He already died once,

514
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,790
yet he never changed.

515
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,550
That's not the point here.

516
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,640
Great Aunt,

517
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,160
I wish...

518
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,590
I know what you're trying to ask.

519
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,590
Whether his eyes can be treated or not,

520
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,030
that depends on this one ingredient.

521
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,720
A blooming Flower of Longing.

522
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,310
Flower of Longing?

523
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,400
That's simple.

524
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I'll just ask my men to deliver them here
from Jingnan.

525
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,640
Flower of Longing is already
a rare find in Jingnan.

526
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,640
If you tell your men to deliver them
all the way to the capital,

527
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,750
they'll surely wilt.

528
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,510
The North is cold.

529
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,440
Even if we get the seeds

530
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,680
and sow them here,

531
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,240
it'll be difficult for them to survive.

532
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,510
I need to give it a try
no matter how difficult it is.

533
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,070
I will stay by Han Ye's side
for the rest of my life

534
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,110
even if he can't regain his vision.

535
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,480
I'm just afraid that your effort might be in vain.

536
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,110
I know his temperament.

537
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,270
I already witnessed how heartless he was

538
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,160
when I proposed to him with 30,000 naval forces.

539
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,830
Ziyuan, you're something else.

540
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,640
It's a shame that I didn't get

541
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,920
to witness

542
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,480
how you courted him shamelessly.

543
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,790
Great Aunt, you can just observe me

544
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,310
for the next few days.

545
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,110
All right.

546
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,510
Great Aunt.

547
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,110
Don't worry.

548
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,750
I'm confident in myself.

549
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,240
Yeah.

550
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,640
We know that you can endure hardships.

551
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,640
You never made a single sound

552
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,680
even when you were hurt in Guiyuan Pavilion.

553
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,110
In the end,

554
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,350
you ran to your room and
wiped away your tears in secret.

555
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
You actually know about that?

556
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,360
This tea smells great.

557
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,630
Brat,

558
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,030
you're pretty good at making tea.

559
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,880
Here.

560
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
Try this tea.

561
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,550
It's White Dew Tea from Xishan.

562
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,510
What do you think?

563
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,960
It's much better than what you had, right?

564
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,630
It's gentle and elegant.

565
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,030
And it has a sweet aftertaste.

566
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,400
Is he here as well?

567
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,480
You know everything indeed.

568
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,550
Do you want to see him?

569
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,000
No need for that.

570
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,000
Madam, please thank him on my behalf.

571
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,070
If so, you have to enjoy this pot of tea slowly.

572
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,400
No one

573
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,800
can brew such excellent tea

574
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,150
once he's gone.

575
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,360
The lass I brought here is boorish.

576
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,280
She doesn't know how to look after people.

577
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,800
Please bear with her.

578
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,550
Please tell her to leave.

579
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,070
She doesn't listen to me.

580
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,510
Madam, at least she'll listen to you.

581
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,590
Are you sure

582
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
she'll listen to me?

583
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
I vanished without a trace

584
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,360
right after she was born.

585
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,760
I never helped her

586
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,000
even though she was in huge trouble.

587
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,190
I don't have the right to tell her what to do.

588
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,070
Han Ye,

589
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,480
if you don't wish to see her,

590
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,880
you should send her away yourself.

591
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,030
Your Highness!

592
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,070
Your Highness!

593
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,510
Great Aunt.

594
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,360
Your Highness!

595
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Your Highness!

596
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,030
You're back!

597
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,320
What are you doing here?

598
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,960
I came here after hearing from Jili
that you were here.

599
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,880
Your Highness.

600
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,880
Your Highness?

601
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,000
Your eyes...

602
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,840
I'm fine.

603
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,760
No wonder...

604
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
No wonder you didn't return to the capital.

605
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,320
Here.

606
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,670
Have a seat.

607
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,070
I just don't want him to think

608
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,190
that the daughter of the Di family

609
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,360
is pampered.

610
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,510
I remember that I was unwilling

611
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,150
to head to the capital back then.

612
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,190
It was as if I was going through a rough time.

613
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,230
I even begged Father for half a month.

614
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,800
After that, I brought you to the capital with me

615
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,070
so that you could support me.

616
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,800
After I entered the capital,

617
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,110
all those noble ladies

618
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,550
visited me.

619
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,230
Not only did they mock me,

620
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,110
but they also caused me a lot of trouble.

621
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,670
Only then did I find out

622
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,960
that the Crown Prince

623
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,510
was desired by everyone

624
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,440
in the capital.

625
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,070
That's right.

626
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,510
At that time, people already started
referring to Han Ye

627
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,960
as the most handsome man in the Central Plains.

628
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,360
But who do they take me for?

629
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,510
All of them didn't get their way.

630
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,480
I taught them a lesson

631
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,840
and sent them home.

632
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,880
Out of all the noble ladies who visited you,

633
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,710
I'm sure some of them excelled at the four arts.

634
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,030
How did you teach them a lesson?

635
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,000
Since I came as the future Crown Princess,

636
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,880
I wouldn't let their visits go in vain.

637
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,880
Listen.

638
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,800
Back then, I stole the founding emperor's edict

639
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,480
from the ancestral hall.

640
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,880
Whenever they came,

641
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
I'd ask our Momo to read it out for them.

642
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,480
Think about it.

643
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,670
They had to kneel whenever the edict was read.

644
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,710
Of course they dared not offend me again.

645
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,280
I was wondering why.

646
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,800
Noble ladies did visit you from time to time

647
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,150
when you first entered the capital.

648
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,550
But they stopped visiting you after that.

649
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,800
I see, it was because of this.

650
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,000
One time,

651
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,510
he saw me when I was teaching
Marquis Zhongyi's daughter

652
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,630
a lesson.

653
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,550
Once that lady left,

654
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,000
he said this to me slowly,

655
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,400
"Lass from the Di family,

656
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,480
you were stirring up trouble in Jingnan
because you were

657
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,590
unwilling to come to the Crown Prince's Residence.

658
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,110
I'm sure that's a hoax.

659
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,400
But now, you're reading

660
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,360
the founding emperor's edict wherever you go.

661
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,360
Looks like you're pretty satisfied with me, huh?"

662
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,760
Han Ye actually did that?

663
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,760
I was still young back then.

664
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,230
I wasn't as thick-skinned as I am now.

665
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,840
When he said that,

666
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
I was so embarrassed.

667
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,480
I wanted to run away.

668
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,760
But he grabbed me by the collar
and brought me back.

669
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
He said to me

670
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,880
that he liked

671
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,190
a bossy and genuine girl like me.

672
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,070
But now,

673
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,480
he's turning me down.

674
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,070
Say,

675
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,670
how did it end up like this?

676
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,630
At first, I didn't want to see anyone.

677
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,150
But after that,

678
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,150
I started to miss you.

679
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,070
Have you done your homework lately?

680
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
You must still do it

681
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,800
even when I'm not around, all right?

682
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,840
I didn't forget about it.

683
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
I finished all of it.

684
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
I'll show it to you next time.

685
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,840
Okay.

686
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,190
Your Highness,

687
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,000
I said the wrong thing.

688
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,760
I'm sorry.

689
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,150
That's fine.

690
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,510
I'm blind now.

691
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,670
There's no need to avoid the topic.

692
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,760
Here.

693
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,800
Try the White Dew Tea from Xishan,
which was brewed by Luo Mingxi.

694
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,630
Your Highness,

695
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,360
are you ignoring Ziyuan

696
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,000
because you lost your sight?

697
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,510
This flower will surely bloom, right?

698
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,480
It will

699
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,150
if everything goes smoothly.

700
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,840
All right.

701
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,280
I'll send it to them

702
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,670
when it blooms.

703
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,030
I don't want them to be happy for nothing.

704
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,670
I'm sure the Flower of Longing will be beautiful

705
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,630
when it blooms.

706
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,550
She'll definitely be happy.

707
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,190
I'm afraid

708
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,670
I can't gift this flower to Ziyuan.

709
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,510
But why?

710
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,840
Because it's a necessary ingredient

711
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,840
for Han Ye to regain his sight.

712
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,840
I planted this flower to make Ziyuan happy

713
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,960
in the first place.

714
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,670
Well,

715
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,800
if Han Ye can regain his sight because of this,

716
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,360
I believe Ziyuan will be much happier.

717
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,230
This might be fate.

718
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,510
And that might be the best way
to use this flower.

719
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,400
Sir?

720
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,280
Sir?

721
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,510
Sir!

722
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,230
Sir!

723
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,400
Sir!

724
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,190
Sir!

725
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,550
Sir.

726
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,880
Sir, you're awake.

727
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,480
Linlang.

728
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,550
The physician just left.

729
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
He said it was a minor cold.

730
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
You'll be fine

731
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,190
after some rest.

732
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,760
I know my own health the best.

733
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,480
