00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,320
he'll surely lead by example.

187
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Young Lady,

188
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,440
we finally withdrew ourselves

189
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,400
from all the mess in the capital
after so much effort.

190
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Why are we heading back again?

191
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,200
I understand your concerns.

192
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,960
But don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

193
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,640
This time,

194
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I will head back with the remnants
of the Di Troops,

195
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,440
work together with the Han family,

196
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,880
and fight against Northern Qin.

197
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,400
Although the path ahead might be treacherous,

198
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,520
we're still

199
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,960
the children of Di Troops.

200
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,200
Our predecessors had spent
their painstaking effort

201
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,680
on this very land.

202
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
Their goal was to achieve world peace

203
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,400
so that the people could live peacefully.

204
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,080
Mo Shuang's death

205
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,400
has brought forward
the invasion of Northern Qin.

206
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,840
Now, only Qingnan City and Junxian City

207
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,680
are capable of defending
the Northwest border of Jing.

208
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,400
Qingnan City can still put up a struggle.

209
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,880
If Qingnan falls,

210
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,600
Jing will fall too.

211
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
Once Jing falls,

212
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,780
Jingnan will fall too.

213
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm joining this battle

214
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,900
for both our nation and our home.

215
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Young Lady, don't worry.

216
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,860
I'll go wherever you go.

217
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,660
Don't leave me behind.

218
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,860
You two can join me if you don't fear death.

219
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,980
However, I'm actually joining this battle

220
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,460
due to my selfish desire.

221
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,220
Anning is my best friend.

222
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,340
Now, she's in a pinch.

223
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,660
I can't just sit idly by.

224
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,740
There's Han Ye too.

225
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,860
Both of them

226
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,740
have been part of my life.

227
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
I can't just ignore them,

228
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,820
and I can't forget about them.

229
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,670
[It's been long since we parted.
Only now do we get to know each other.]

230
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,980
(Ziyuan,)

231
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,060
(although we've parted ways,)

232
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,940
(I never expected us to be reunited
in such a chaotic period.)

233
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,780
(In the future, you and I,)

234
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,340
(the Han family and the Di family,)

235
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,780
(I wonder how things will turn out for us.)

236
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,260
Official Leng,

237
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,380
I've never seen

238
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,300
General doing her rounds lately.

239
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,340
And you brought her meals into her room yourself.

240
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,420
Is she sick?

241
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,420
General is fine.

242
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,500
It's just that she's been reading
the reports sent from the army lately.

243
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,620
I reported to General

244
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,260
about the news we received from our spies.

245
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,620
However, she never got back to me.

246
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,220
I have some new ideas

247
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,380
to discuss with General today.

248
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,060
General just fell asleep.

249
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,940
She said

250
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
no one was to enter her room

251
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,620
without permission.

252
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,940
If not, they shall receive military punishment.

253
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,900
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

254
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,700
I shouldn't have let you know where I was staying.

255
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,340
You're finishing my fine tea here.

256
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,780
This batch of tea smells more fragrant.

257
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,700
I'll take it with me.

258
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Did I say that I was going to give it to you?

259
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,540
I'm not taking it for free.

260
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,780
I know you dislike bitterness
when you take medicine.

261
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,540
It's a trade.

262
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,020
So, you're trading a box of preserved fruits

263
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,780
for my top-grade tea?

264
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,540
Is this what you mean by being a gentleman?

265
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,660
Ren Anle is unreasonable

266
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,580
while you're a cunning fox yourself.

267
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,540
Even a gentleman like me

268
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,420
will be influenced somehow, you know?

269
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,060
So, it's my fault now?

270
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,540
The flower bud has a bluish hue,
like a piece of jade.

271
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,940
It's elegant and beautiful.

272
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,260
I assume it's beautiful when it blooms.

273
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,420
This is the Flower of Longing
I planted for Ziyuan.

274
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,340
The Flower of Longing is rare to see
even in Jingnan.

275
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,180
It's even harder to grow it in the capital.

276
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,660
The things you do for Ziyuan

277
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,740
suit her the best.

278
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Compared to you,

279
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,220
the gifts I sent to Dai Mountain

280
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,060
only represented my wishful thinking.

281
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,860
Han Ye,

282
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,940
I've watched over Ziyuan for ten years.

283
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,860
Now, she's heading to the battlefield.

284
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,340
If anything happens to her,

285
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,020
I will never let you off.

286
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,780
Don't worry.

287
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,540
I'll surely protect her with my life.

288
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,420
However,

289
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,220
if I do die on the battlefield,

290
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,780
please keep watching over Ziyuan.

291
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,780
You mustn't die.

292
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
If you die out there,

293
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
the top-grade tea I gave you

294
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,100
would be wasted.

[Qingnan City Outpost]

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,980
Our soldiers are ready to go.

299
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,740
However, the soldiers of Jing
are still defending the city.

300
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,660
Your Highness, please make haste.

301
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,620
Once the commander is gone,

302
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,540
Qingnan City will be ours.

303
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,860
Your Highness,

304
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,940
all of us want to avenge the Princess.

305
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,540
We won't let the Princess' sacrifice

306
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,460
be in vain.

307
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,340
I will make sure the Northern Qin's plan
can proceed smoothly.

308
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,460
Your Highness.

309
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,460
Wouldn't it be great if you were just a princess?

310
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,100
You look better with makeup on.

311
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,180
Heed my advice.

312
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,660
It's not too late for you to hand over
the commander's tally.

313
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,660
You know Northern Qin inside out.

314
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,180
You're from Northern Qin,

315
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,820
aren't you?

316
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,700
Your Highness, you're intelligent indeed.

317
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,100
If that's the case,

318
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,380
you should understand this.

319
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,340
With our current military strength,

320
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,420
even if we do take down Qingnan City,

321
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,860
we can only rule over the Northwest.

322
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,780
Jing has plenty of other territories.

323
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,140
Why must you guys
insist on defending the Northwest?

Defending our territory from invaders

325
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,060
is the principle I abide by as a citizen of Jing.

326
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,940

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,100
You want the commander's tally

so that you can relay a fake military order

330
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,300
and force Jing to pull out of Qingnan City.

However, this is an emergency.

Bai Zheng,

346
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,580
you shouldn't frame me when you're the spy here.

He's the true spy.

when you're the traitor here.

353
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,300
We'll know who the spy is

once we go inside!

355
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,300
He has the General under his control!

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,180
Go and save the General!

357
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,180
I said the General needed to take a break
due to fatigue.

No one shall go inside!

General,

367
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,460
you were drugged by him for some time.

And you never took any food.

369
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,180
It's common for you
to experience weakness in your limbs.

370
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,180
Also, your anxiety affected your health.

371
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,300
You need to rest and recuperate.

372
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,180
The battle is more important.

373
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,100
The safety of Jing is more important than my life.

374
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,460
How's the defense in Qingnan City?

375
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,900
General, I increased the number
of defending troops

376
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,820
as per your previous order.

377
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,420
According to our scouts,

378
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,820
the Northern Qin Army hasn't made any moves yet.

379
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,940
However, I've instructed them

380
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,660
to be on standby.

381
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,700
Increase the number of patrols.

382
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,660
The Northern Qin Army

383
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,340
might launch a sneak attack at any time.

384
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,580
Yes, General.

385
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,460
General,

386
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,580
I failed my duties.

387
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,980
I didn't discover

388
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,300
that Lengbei was holding you hostage.

389
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,700
Please punish me.

390
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,700
Get up.

391
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,820
He's been with me for five years.

392
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,060
Even I couldn't tell
that he harbored such wild ambitions.

393
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,100
It wasn't your fault.

394
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,180
I need to write to Luo Mingxi

395
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,700
and ask him

396
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,500
to investigate Lengbei's background.

(This is His Majesty's oral edict.)

399

Mo Bei,

400
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,140
as the Prince of Northern Qin,

401
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,900
you failed to kill the Princess of Jing
even when you'd remained undercover

402
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,540
beside her for a long time.

403
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,780
You're useless.

404
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Not only did you delay our plan,

405
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,780
but your identity was also exposed.

406
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,780
You fool!

407
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,420
Northern Qin is different from Jing.

408
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,140
You're not my only son.

409
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,780
In Northern Qin, strength means everything.

410
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,660
Only the person who renders first-class merit

411
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,620
has the right to inherit my throne.

412
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,980
As for you,

413
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,260
you'd better watch out.

414
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

415
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Your Highness, you're injured.

416
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,260
Please get up.

Please put in a good word for me then.

Good.

432
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,620
Let's hope that Princess Anning
will receive the letter as soon as possible.

433
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,260
We have limited forces in Northern Qin.

434
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,180
However, we found out about Lengbei's background

435
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,340
in such a short time.

436
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,820
Linlang, it must've been tough on you.

437
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,860
It's my duty.

438
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,340
This time,

439
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,340
we utilized all of our secret connections
in Northern Qin

440
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
before we could locate the maidservant
who was serving his mother.

441
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,380
Only then did we figure out his true identity.

442
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,860
Lengbei. Mo Bei.

443
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,580
Who would've thought

444
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,780
that he was the Prince of Northern Qin?

445
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,860
Although he's a prince,

446
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,060
he has been given the cold shoulder
because he's not the illegitimate son.

447
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,340
His identity and background remained hidden.

448
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,100
That's why we found nothing

449
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,460
when we tried to look into him at first.

450
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,980
However, he endured humiliation

451
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,740
to achieve his goal.

452
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,740
With that determination and scheming,

453
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,460
the world will be in danger

454
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,060
if he becomes the Emperor of Northern Qin.

455
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,740
Lengbei remained undercover
beside Princess Anning for many years.

456
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,340
It's indeed hard to know one's true colors.

457
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,220
I'm sure Princess Anning was heartbroken

458

when she found out about it.

459

Don't worry.

460
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,460
Anning doesn't act based on her emotions.

461
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,620
She was just unwary of Lengbei.

462
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,860
But now that she knows
about Lengbei's true identity,

463
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,620
I'm sure she's the first person

A prince of Northern Qin.

527
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,140
Why would a prince be willing to go undercover

528
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
and be a bodyguard for so many years?

529
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,100
His mother was a palace servant.

530
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,380
Therefore, he wasn't favored
by the Emperor of Northern Qin.

531
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,620
And he was despised

532
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,860
due to his lowly background.

533

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,940
many people will lose their homes and shelters.

551
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,060
I wonder how Anning is doing.

552
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,340
We must end this war as soon as possible

553
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,140
to prevent further casualties.

554
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,980
You're right.

555
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,460
Speed up our march.

556
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,620
Yes, ma'am.

00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:12,980
It doesn't matter.

Your Highness,

562
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,860
Han Ye, the Crown Prince of Jing,
has already arrived at Junxian City.

563
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,980
Di Ziyuan will also arrive soon.

564
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,980
Qingnan City was built on rugged terrain.

565
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,100
It's easy to defend and hard to invade.

566
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,340
Now, Di Ziyuan's army from Jingnan
is approaching us

567
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,700
as the vanguard unit.

568
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,220
If they rendezvous with the Jing's army,

569
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,220
it'll be difficult for us to win.

570
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,340
We mustn't let Di Ziyuan arrive at the borders.

571
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,460
Yes, Your Highness.

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,620
What did they say?

575
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,980
Northern Qin wishes to ambush Ziyuan.

576
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,740
If so, Anle is...

577
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,220
I'll back her up.

618

620

What are you doing?

621
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,460
General, please issue a retreat.

622
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,300
With our current strength,

623
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,500
we won't be able to stop Northern Qin

624
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,100
even if we fight with our lives on the line.

625
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,820
I will never retreat.

626
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,100
You should get up.

627
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,460
But, General,

628
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,620
you're more than a general.

629
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,380
You're also the Princess of Jing.

630
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,580
That's precisely why I cannot retreat.

631
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,620
If I retreat now,

632
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,660
our morale will be gone.

633
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
But, General,

00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,820
Official Luo's reinforcements
haven't arrived yet.

635
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,660
I'm afraid...

636
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,620
They will come.

(to stand in front of you)

(and Qingnan City)

644

(is defended successfully?)

645
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,540

646
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,180
we intercepted a secret letter
from Northern Qin.

647
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,940
General.

648
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:37,980
What's wrong?

649
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,180
Ziyuan was ambushed.

650
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,620
How can we defend the city
without any reinforcements?

651
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,340
All the more reason
why we have to defend Qingnan City

652
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,380
when we don't have reinforcements.

653
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,900
Once Official Luo's army

654
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,940
and Ziyuan's army from Jingnan are here,

655
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,940
we'll definitely

656
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,940
be able to defeat Northern Qin.

657
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,900
We have to buy time

658
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,380
for them.

659
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,180
Yes, General.

660
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Reporting in!

661
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,180
Sir,

662
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,660
we received a secret letter.

663
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
"Jingnan Army was ambushed
by the Northern Qin Army

664
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,260
on their way to Qingnan City."

665
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,620
We will turn back!

666
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,180
Sir,

667
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,740
Qingnan City is right ahead.

668
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,500
Where are we going?

669
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,100
Di Ziyuan is trapped in Junxian City.

670
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,180
We shall rescue her.

671
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,860
Sir,

672
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,580
we're to provide reinforcements to Qingnan City

673
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,820
under His Majesty's order.

674
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,180
I'm afraid we cannot follow your orders

675
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,300
without an official military order.

676
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,500
General Anning is stationed at Qingnan City.

677
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,660
They can still hold the invaders up
for a few more days.

678
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,900
However, Official Di
doesn't have the time to do so.

679
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,180
This is a military order!

680
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,020
His Majesty appointed me
as the Commander of the Palace Guards.

681
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,660
My duty is to deploy troops
and dispatch generals.

682
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,420
Don't blame me
for giving you military punishment

683
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,820
if you don't follow my order!

684
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,180
Let's go!

685
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,660
Young Lady, you're hurt.

686
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,660
I'm fine.

687
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,100
The Northern Qin Army is strong indeed.

688
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,620
Let's continue!

689
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,180
Yes, Young Lady!

690
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,420
Ziyuan, be careful!

691
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,820
