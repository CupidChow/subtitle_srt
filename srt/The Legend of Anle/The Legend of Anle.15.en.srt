00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,780
She's just an orphan now.

189
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,380
Who's helping her?

190
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,500
Don't tell me

191
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
it's the Crown Prince.

192
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,180
The Crown Prince

193
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,540
has always been honest and forthcoming.

194
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,980
I don't think

195
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,340
he would try to threaten anyone from behind.

196
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,540
No matter who has her back,

197
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,100
in the Imperial Harem,

198
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,540
I have the final say.

199
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,140
Sir.

200
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,300
Instead of recuperating in your room,

201
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,180
what are you doing out here?

202
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,300
The weather is turning cold,

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,140
and I'm worried
that the Flower of Longing may not survive.

204
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,740
Even if it does not survive,

205
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,500
could it be any weaker than you are now?

206
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,060
Jinse.

207
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,180
Help Miss Linlang back to her room.

208
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,860
Yes, sir.

209
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,900
Official Luo,
there's something I need to tell you.

210
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,300
Mu Qing has sent the word

211
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,260
that Di Cheng'en has been summoned
by the Empress Dowager,

212
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,180
and he hasn't received any news for eight hours.

213
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,700
What a coincidence.

214
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,820
I just heard

215
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,100
that Marquis Zhongyi
visited the Empress Dowager yesterday.

216
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,260
Should I...

217
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,740
No.

218
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,860
Jinse.

219
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,180
Inform Princess Anning about this.

220
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:18,940
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,500
Wait.

222
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
And Official Ren too.

223
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,700
Yes, sir.

224
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,620
You're not the only one

225
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,740
in Qianyue Pavilion working for me.

226
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,620
Official Luo, why do you want to inform

227
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,620
Official Ren about this?

228
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,180
If Anning hears that Di Cheng'en
has been summoned by the Empress Dowager,

229
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,340
she may respond in surprising ways.

230
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,620
Anle refuses to believe

231
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,060
that Anning knew the truth
behind the Di massacre.

232
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,180
It's time for her to see it.

233
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,540
Marquis Zhongyi and the Empress Dowager

234
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,940
are plotting something now.

235
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,140
Sparing Di Cheng'en's life

236
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,140
would prove useful for now.

237
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
Is there anything else you want me to do?

238
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,780
Yes.

239
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,180
Get back to your room and recuperate.

240
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,500
Yes, sir.

241
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,060
[Jingxin Hall]

242
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Your Majesty.

243
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,180
The Crown Prince is here.

244
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,780
Ye.

245
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,060
Your Highness.

246
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,980
Greetings, Grandmother.

247
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,900
Offer some incense to your grandfather.

248
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,180
Yes, Grandmother.

249
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,420
Grandmother.

250
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,860
Grandfather doted on Cheng'en when he was alive,

251
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,180
so why don't we let her offer incense too?

252
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,620
When Cheng'en came,

253
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,660
I told her the same thing,

254
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,580
but she said

255
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,660
that she is the daughter of a sinner

256
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,460
who is not qualified to offer incense
to your grandfather.

257
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
She would rather kneel in front of Buddha

258
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,620
and transcribe Buddhist sutras

259
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,820
to pray for the nation.

260
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,780
Yes.

261
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
I am the daughter of a sinner.

262
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,220
I do not want to disturb the late Emperor.

263
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,340
Cheng'en.

264
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,780
Don't see yourself as inferior.

265
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,540
I am not seeing myself as inferior.

266
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,540
This is the truth.

267
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,220
I hope that I can atone

268
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
for some of the sins that my family has committed

269
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,060
with the rest of my life.

270
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,420
Ye.

271
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,580
Here.

272
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,100
Ye.

273
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,300
You have not visited me in a long time.

274
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,660
Is it because you are busy with national affairs?

275
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,140
My apologies.

276
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,900
I just heard from the servants

277
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,460
that you've been having frequent headaches.

278
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,780
Have you gotten any better?

279
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,420
Seeing you now

280
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,100
makes me feel much better.

281
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,540
I heard

282
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,220
that you have been working
with a female pirate from Jingnan

283
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,940
and solved many major cases.

284
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,220
Yes.

285
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,420
Ren Anle

286
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,420
sounds like a decent lady.

287
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,900
I've also heard

288
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,900
that she's joining the Crown Princess selection.

289
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,860
Di Cheng'en

290
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,020
used to be

291
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,180
too brash and active,

292
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,140
but after resting at Dai Mountain for ten years,

293
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,660
she has grown to be quiet and gentle.

294
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,660
Her father would be pleased

295
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,980
to see her now.

296
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,900
Thank you for the compliment, Your Majesty.

297
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,780
Cheng'en.

298
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,300
Show me the sutras

299
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,900
that you've transcribed.

300
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,380
Your handwriting is decent.

302
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

303
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,100
Yongning Temple is peaceful and tranquil.

304
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,420
Listening to the bell chiming every day

305
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,420
reminds me of my reckless behavior as a child,

306
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
which fills me with regret.

307
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,460
This is why I've been praying
and transcribing sutras every day

308
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,580
to clear my mind

309
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,220
while praying for you and the nation.

310
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,100
What a good child.

311
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,660
Your Majesty, if you don't mind,

312
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,900
I'd love to come here every day

313
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,500
and stay by your side.

314
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,180
Silly girl.

315
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,660
Why would you want to keep
an old lady company every day?

316
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,180
If I want to meet you,

317
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,060
I can just summon you here like so.

318
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,780
Yes.

319
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,940
Grandmother, if you want to meet Cheng'en,

320
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,300
you can tell me,

321
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,460
and I'll take her here.

322
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,300
Cheng'en.

323
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Your clothes are smudged.

324
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,580
I shall give you a new set of clothes.

325
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,300
Take Miss Di away and change her clothes

326
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,420
before someone teases her.

327
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

328
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,460
It's getting late.

329
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,300
We'd hate to disturb you any longer.

330
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,220
Why don't I take Cheng'en

331
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
back to her residence?

332
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,940
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

333
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,820
Follow me.

334
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,300
I have prepared some tea and snacks
in the side hall.

335
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,940
You may wait for her there.

336
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,540
Once Cheng'en changes into her new clothes,

337
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,260
you two can relax and enjoy.

338
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,780
Yes, Grandmother.

339
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,740
I shall do so.

340
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,780
Oh, our Founding Emperor.

341
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,220
Is this the queen you and Di Shengtian

342
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,820
had chosen for our nation?

343
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,780
Di Shengtian.

344
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,300
Look carefully.

345
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,980
Your daughter

346
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,820
is nothing more than a joke.

347
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,420
[Residence of the Princess]

348
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,500
General.

349
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,340
Miss Di was summoned
by the Empress Dowager this morning,

350
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,460
and she is still not back yet.

351
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,820
(When will the Empress Dowager
ever stop giving the Di family a hard time?)

352
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,500
Miss Di, once you change into these clothes,

353
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,780
you shall continue kneeling here

354
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,340
while transcribing the sutras

355
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,980
and pray for the nation.

356
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,580
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,180
(The Empress Dowager)

358
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,580
(actually gave me a set of servant clothes?)

359
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,220
Your Majesty.

360
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,020
I have executed your orders.

361
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,020
My grandson

362
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,260
must not have anything to do

363
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,740
with that Di woman.

364
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,700
There is only one Crown Prince
in the Jing State.

365
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,580
No matter who he marries,

366
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,340
as his grandmother, I have no objections,

367
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,540
except for anyone from the Di family.

368
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,820
All of you, back off!

369
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,460
I want to meet the Empress Dowager!

370
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,820
It's been a long time since I saw you.

371
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,220
Are you trying to demolish my residence?

372
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,220
Grandmother, release Di Cheng'en now.

373
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,940
Nonsense!

374
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,820
Are you starting a rebellion

375
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,660
just for that Di woman?

376
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,740
The entire Di family has been exterminated

377
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,740
save for their sole surviving daughter.

378
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,300
Can't you spare her life?

379
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,100
Protect Her Majesty!

380
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,300
All of you, back off!

381
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,700
I want to see

382
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,020
if Princess Anning

383
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,260
is really intent on killing me.

384
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,940
You lost your mother when you were young,

385
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,340
so I have always spoiled

386
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,300
and protected you.

387
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,300
I let you do whatever you wanted to do.

388
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,500
Even when you requested
to be stationed in the Northwest,

389
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,820
I pleaded your case before the Emperor.

390
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,220
The Princess of Jing

391
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,540
may have explored the vast world,

392
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,020
but now that you've returned,

393
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,220
you've turned into
a rebellious, unfilial young lady.

394
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,740
Ask yourself.

395
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,500
Have I not

396
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,540
fulfilled my moral obligations
to the fullest extent?

397
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,260
Who in the world instigated you

398
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,820
to treat me like a total stranger?

399
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,420
I only want to see Di Cheng'en

400
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,540
and ensure that she's safe.

401
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,980
You...

402
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Fine.

403
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,300
Take Princess Anning

404
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,780
to Di Cheng'en.

405
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,100
Your Highness, please come with me.

406
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,340
Your Majesty!

407
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,460
Ziyuan.

408
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,340
Anning?

409
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:31,980
What brings you here?

410
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,940
Get up.

411
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,380
Are you fine?

412
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,580
Wait, Anning.

413
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Let go of me.

414
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,580
I'm holding an ink stone,

415
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,140
and I might smudge your clothes.

416
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,220
Sun Momo,

417
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
sorry for making you wait.

418
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,580
I will finish transcribing the sutras
as fast as I can

419
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,740
and present them to the Empress Dowager.

420
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,700
Why are you doing this?

421
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,980
This ink stone.

422
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,980
These clothes.

423
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,220
Is this

424
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,500
how everyone here humiliates her?

425
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
Princess Anning.

426
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,460
Calm down.

427
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,220
Anning.

428
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,300
No.

429
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
That's not what happened.

430
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,340
The Empress Dowager has treated me kindly.

431
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,860
I accidentally spilled

432
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,500
some tea on my clothes,

433
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,940
so the Empress Dowager gave me these clothes.

434
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,260
You're safe now.

435
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,460
Let's go.

436
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,740
No, Anning.

437
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,140
Anning, what are you doing here?

438
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,020
Your Highness.

439
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,860
Your Highness.

440
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,900
Ridiculous.

441
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,260
My grandmother ordered you
to get Miss Di some fresh clothes,

442
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
and you're treating her cruelly here.

443
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,460
Are you disrespecting my grandmother

444
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,340
or me, the Crown Prince?

445
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,820
Forgive me, Your Highness.

446
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,980
It was Miss Di who said

447
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,580
that it was still early,

448
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,740
so she wanted to stay here

449
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,700
and finish transcribing the sutras.

450
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,540
-Yes...
-Impossible.

451
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,980
Ziyuan would never say that.

452
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,580
Let's go.

453
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,940
No.

454
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,220
Anning, let go of me.

455
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,820
Anning.

456
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,020
If my grandmother asks,

457
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,340
tell her that I took Miss Di away.

458
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,340
It has nothing to do with Anning.

459
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,500
Yes, Your Highness.

460
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,980
Anning.

461
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,980
Let go of me.

462
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,500
You're hurting me.

463
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,740
Ziyuan.

464
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,980
You shouldn't have entered the palace alone.

465
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,100
Your Highness.

466
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,460
My name is Di Cheng'en.

467
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,580
There are many people in the palace.

468
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,100
Don't call me by the wrong name.

469
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,940
You can be angry at

470
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,660
or upset about what transpired today,

471
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,140
but as long as I'm around,

472
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,300
I will not let you enter the palace alone again.

473
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:43,980
Cheng'en.

474
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,500
My inconsiderate thinking

475
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,620
has caused you much suffering in the palace.

476
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,700
Anning has always been impulsive.

477
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:54,980
Don't blame her.

478
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,620
Ye.

479
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,740
I didn't suffer.

480
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,260
I do not blame the Princess.

481
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,100
It's just that

482
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,940
I've been kneeling the whole day

483
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,620
transcribing sutras
in the Empress Dowager's room,

484
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,340
and my legs are feeling weak,

485
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,700
so...

486
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,660
It's rather hard for me
to walk back to my residence.

487
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,460
Young Lady.

488
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,620
Are you all right?

489
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,340
Your Highness.

490
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,380
Princess.

491
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Since Mu Qing is here,

492
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,740
follow him back to your residence and rest.

493
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,220
I...

494
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,540
Take care on your way back.

495
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,140
Go now.

496
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,660
Ye.

497
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,980
You should rest early too.

498
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,860
Sure.

499
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,620
Why did the Empress Dowager torture you so?

500
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Let's return to Dai Mountain.

501
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,100
I'll take you away from this troubled land.

502
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,700
Mu Qing.

503
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,740
I waited ten years
before I could leave the mountain.

504
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,020
I don't want to go back there.

505
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,140
I know

506
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,380
you care about me,

507
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,580
but I also know

508
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,500
you'll stay by my side,

509
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,140
won't you?

510
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,620
Rest assured.

511
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,500
As long as you want me,

512
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,580
I will always stay by your side.

513
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
(Ten years ago, we shared
a fateful moment under an umbrella.)

514
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,140
(The capital will protect you from harm, Miss Di.)

515
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,620
(I don't want to get stomped on anymore.)

516
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,180
(No matter who you are,)

517
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,460
(everything's good as long as you help me.)

518
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,820
[Wanshou Hall]

519
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,500
Your Highness.

520
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,620
Why the long face?

521
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,740
You don't look like someone

522
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,140
who just met your loved one.

523
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,660
I guess

524
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,340
you do need me, Ren Anle,

525
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,380
to stay by your side

526
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,900
and get rid of your troubles.

527
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,060
Ren Anle.

528
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,020
You have an apt name.

529
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,700
Can you really get rid of all my troubles

530
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,340
and help me rejoice every day?

531
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,420
Your Highness,

532
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,060
you'll have to ask yourself.

533
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,700
When you're with me,

534
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,340
do you feel happier than usual?

535
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,460
As the Crown Prince of Jing,

536
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,340
I've always lived by the rules.

537
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,220
I never thought that someday,

538
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,380
I would meet a lady

539
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,340
as unreasonable

540
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,100
and brash as you are.

541
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,020
Since that's the case,

542
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,140
why can't you let go

543
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,620
of your obsession with Miss Di?

544
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,740
You've been to the Residence of Marquis Jing'an.

545
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,020
You saw how desolate and ruined the place is.

546
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,620
But who would expect

547
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,940
that ten years ago,

548
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,420
it had the most beautiful
spring panoramas in the capital?

549
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,780
Back then, Ziyuan was dressed in opulent clothes

550
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,700
and lived as a carefree girl.

551
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,020
That place is no longer
the same paradise as it was.

552
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,220
You refuse to let go

553
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,460
of your obsession with Miss Di

554
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,700
because you feel guilty, don't you?

555
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,700
Yes.

556
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,620
Ten years ago, I failed to protect Ziyuan.

557
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,340
It's my lifelong guilt.

558
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,740
Anle.

559
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,980
I don't want the palace

560
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,540

too concerned about Di Cheng'en?

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,340
when I saw how she tried
to speak up for Di Cheng'en,

581
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,860
I felt...

582
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,540
Don't tell me to be cautious of her.

583
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740

concerned about your happiness, Your Highness.

612
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,540
That's why I took a glance at them.

613

Right?

614
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,820
There's Miss Zhao, who looks poised and polite,

615

and Miss Gao, elegant and refined.

616

Then, there's Miss Wen,
who comes from a military family,

617
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,460
and she's absolutely dashing.

618
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,660
I heard that her horse-riding and archery skills

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,260
are the best in the capital, Your Highness.

620
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,380

00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,180
while pushing Ren Anle
to the wall with the other."

746
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,580
Well, Your Highness?

747
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,780
Do you like this huaben?

748
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,020
You don't have time to read it,

749
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,500
but I'm sure the populace does.

750
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,340
Tomorrow, I'll get Yuanqin and Yuanshu

751
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,780
to print 180 copies of this huaben

752
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,140
and distribute them around.

753
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,820
It's going to be another bestseller.

754
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,020
Ren Anle, you...

755
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,100
Your Highness.

756
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,300
A huaben

757
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,340
for an invitation.

758
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,460
Sounds like a good deal, doesn't it?

759
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,020
Fine.

760
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,700
Your Highness, you could have
given it to me sooner

761
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,740
so I didn't have to rack my brains

762
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,820
and write a mushy story.

763
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,500
Your Highness,

764
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,260
are you finally giving Anle the invitation card?

765
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
I know where it is.

766
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,180
I'll get it for you.

767
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,260
I meant,

768
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,540
sure.

769
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,500
Go ahead and print the huaben.

770
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,020
Your Highness, read carefully.

771
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,780
This huaben is laden with explicit content.

772
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,900
If this story spreads around,

773
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,100
it's going to ruin your reputation.

774
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,500
It's just grapevine talk among the people.

775
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,180
As the Crown Prince,

776
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,260
I need to handle the pressure
from public opinion.

777
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,620
Moreover...

778
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,580
Official Ren, you put into so much effort
to create such a masterpiece,

779
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,540
so we should let more people

780
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,020
admire your talent in literature.

781
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,500
Ren Anle.

782
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,980
Did you imagine me to be thin-skinned?

783
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,820
Your Highness.

784
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,700
Read closely.

785
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,980
As the Crown Prince,

786
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,660
if this story spreads,

787
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,060
by then,

788
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,100
more people will be gossiping

789
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,540
about our rumored relationship.

790
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,820
Since I am the Crown Prince,

791
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,500
as long as I have a clear conscience,

792
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,500
why should I worry about baseless gossip?

793
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,380
Your Highness, is your conscience truly clear?

794
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,660
Since you can't remember what happened,

795
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,260
why don't I remind you

796
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,180
