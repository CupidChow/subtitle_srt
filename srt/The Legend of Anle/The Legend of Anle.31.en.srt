A lantern made
by the Crown Prince of Jing himself

much brighter and more colorful lanterns

249
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,770
you were as reluctant to leave as I was.

That's right.

257
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,140
It was because I was so aware

258
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
that I couldn't stop it

259
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,100

a world of peace and prosperity.

was burned to death.

575

There was a fire at Sifang House,
