00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,580
Repay you?

188
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,660
How?

189
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,750
It's slightly crooked.

190
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,660

Excuse me,

199
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,390
are you guys buying anything?

200
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,750
You have such a gentle face.

201
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,030
You mustn't let these ugly masks

202
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,660
cover it up.

203
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,820
The Jiangnan marketplace is pretty lively.

204
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,390
It doesn't look like
it's affected by the flood at all.

205
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,820
I'm sure someone is hiding the truth.

Candied hawthorns for sale!

208
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,540
Mister,

209
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,390
let's buy one each.

210
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,540
Here.

211
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,030
-Thank you, mister.
-Keep the change.

212
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,750
Thank you, mister.

213
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,660
I understand now.

214
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,780
You weren't willing to buy two

215
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,660
because Jiangnan was lacking in supplies
after the flood.

216
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,150
That's why you only bought one for me.

217
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,510
Food is precious here.

218
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,110
But why are we able to buy them so easily?

219
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,180
Let's check out the rice shop.

220
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,150
[Shenghe Rice Shop]

221
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,390
Such a strong smell.

222
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,150
Dear customers.

223
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,350
Are you guys here to buy rice?

224
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
Yes. Mister,

225
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,150
I'll have one dan of brown rice.

226
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,510
One dan?

227
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,030
Mister,

228
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,900
you're buying too little here.

229
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,540
One dan is too little?

230
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,420
It can last us for at least half a year.

231
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,900
You two must be from out of town.

232
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,540
You guys might have no idea.

233
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,900
Our shop usually does business

234
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,420
with rich families.

235
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,150
We don't sell rice to individual buyers
like you two.

236
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,750
And they're not willing to purchase in bulk.

237
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,870
Are you saying that you have
too much rice in store?

238
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,660
That's right. There's too much rice.

239
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,270
Mister,

240
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,180
just give me your price.

241
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,660
Two silver taels per dan?

242
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,420
It's 20 silver taels per dan.

243
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,630
20 silver taels?

244
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,420
That's expensive.

245
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,780
Forget it. Let's head to another shop.

246
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,750
Let's go.

247
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,270
You misers.

248
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,780
You guys will starve to death soon.

249
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,540
Jiangnan encountered a flood,
and their harvest was subpar.

250
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,270
However, merchants here
actually have excess grain in stock?

251
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,750
This is obviously strange.

252
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,030
Your Highness, do you know what's stranger?

253
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,390
There was dust mixed within the rice.

254
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,270
These are aged rice.

255
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,660
These should be grain from the imperial granary.

256
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,750
They kept them during years of bountiful harvest
and used them for disaster relief efforts.

257
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,750
That's why the rice is in this state.

258
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,900
Let's go.

259
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Let's head back and discuss it.

260
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,540
Where are we going?

261
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,900
It's a long street.
We haven't finished shopping yet.

262
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,660
There's nothing else to shop for.

263
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,230
Your Highness, since you've witnessed
how prosperous Jiangnan is,

264
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,150
isn't it time for us
to witness the other side now?

265
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,030
Yes.

266
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,350
I assume the flood victims

267
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,150
have been chased out of the city.

268
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,900
Ren Anle,

269
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,030
why did you bring me here?

270
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,780
What are you doing?

271
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,150
I'm helping you to put on a disguise.

272
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,390
It's too obvious if we pretend to be flood victims
in this getup.

273
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:40,750
Come here.

274
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,780
I...

275
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,780
Well...

276
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,390
I can do it myself.

277
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,660
You'll take forever.

278
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,150
Come on.

279
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,150
Hold this.

280
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,780
What are you trying to do?

281
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,780
We have to smear our faces too.

282
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,350
Fine, then.

283
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,150
Mister.

284
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,900
I have nothing.

285
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,420
Go away.

286
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,780
Mister.

287
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,900
Stop right there!

288
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,660
What are you two doing?

289
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,870
Sirs,

290
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,510
we're starving.

291
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,900
The governor prohibited you guys
from staying in the city.

292
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,030
How dare lowly victims like you two
still stay in the city!

293
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,750
Sir, please spare us some food.

294
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,660
Come! Bring them to the usual spot.

295
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,150
Move!

296
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:35,900
Hurry up!

297
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,540
Don't waste my time.

298
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:40,900
Next.

299
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,180
I'm starving.

300
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,870
Next.

301
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,630
Don't waste my time.

302
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,660
Hurry up!

303
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,150
Don't push me!

304
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,030
What a bully!

305
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,230
Forget it.

306
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,030
Here.

307
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,780
-Slowly.
-Those at the back, hurry.

308
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,990
When the borders are at war,

309
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,620
they sent their sons

310
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,910
and husbands to the war.

311
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,270
During droughts,

312
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,140
they dug ditches to irrigate the fields.

313
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,750
But now...

314
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,620
Those at the back, hurry.

315
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,910
Your Highness,

316
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,910
there are plenty of things
you haven't witnessed yet.

317
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,540
They take human lives lightly.

318
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,620
They treat the people like animals.

319
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,910
Please give me more.

320
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,910
It's my fault.

321
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,750
This isn't your fault.

322
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,670
It's the fault of those corrupt officials.

323
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,030
They get away with doing whatever they want
and embezzle funds without feeling guilty.

324
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,140
That's why people are suffering.

325
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,030
Ren Anle,

326
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,620
mind your words.

327
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,030
You better take those words back.

328
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,540
I'm telling you all this

329
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,910
because I treat you as my true friend.

330
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,780
I'm in no mood to banter

331
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
after witnessing such a scene.

332
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,620
Coming.

333
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,270
It's raining.

334
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,100
Prepare to leave.

335
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Keep the food away.

336
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,470
Please give us more!

337
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,910
Please give us a little more!

338
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,750
I told you there was no more food!

339
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,910
Move aside!

340
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,140
Let's head back.

341
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,230
Here.

342
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,340
Don't get drenched.

343
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,340
I was drenched long ago.

344
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,710
The soil on your face is gone.

345
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,620
Let's leave. Our identities might be exposed.

346
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,470
Ren Anle,

347
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,820
between reassuring the people
and investigating Mutian Prefecture,

348
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,540
I wish to proceed with the former first.

349
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,910
However, you can't do that

350
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,950
without a sufficient food supply.

351
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,620
I have an idea.

352
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,510
The rice merchants have plenty of food supply.

353
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,470
So, Your Highness, you intend

354
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,190
to emulate what I did in the past and rob them?

355
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,340
We still need to follow the righteous path.

356
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,100
Your Highness,
since the lucky Ren Anle is with you,

357
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
you'll definitely achieve what you desire.

358
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,270
Sir.

359
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,620
Sir,

360
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,470
the wind is fierce, and it's pouring out there.

361
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,910
This medicine can ward off the cold.

362
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,140
Here's some candied fruit.

363
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,190
By the way, sir,

364
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,140
Qianyue Pavilion has investigated
Lengbei's background.

365
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,620
There was nothing suspicious about it.

366
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,580
His family was living in the border area
between the Jing State and Northern Qin

367
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,820
and was shattered due to the war.

368
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,540
He was saved by Princess Anning five years ago.

369
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,860
After that, the Princess took him in
as her bodyguard.

370
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,380
Princess Anning treats him differently.

371
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,060
Maybe it's because

372
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,380
she saved him at the foot of Qingnan Mountain.

373
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,580
[Qingnan Mountain, Capital]

374
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,780
General, I met you on Qingnan Mountain.

375
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,710
Back then, I was fighting against
a group of Northern Qin soldiers by myself.

376
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,510
I was cornered.

377
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,430
That's right.

378
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,140
You slew all of them

379
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,750
by yourself.

380
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,140
I thought to myself

381
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,100
that you could be of use to the Jing State.

382
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,860
General, thank you for saving me.

383
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,470
What's your name?

384
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,470
Lengbei.

385
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,860
Why are you following me?

386
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,860
General, I will follow you.

387
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,100
I command tens of thousands of soldiers
from the Northeast.

388
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,670
What gives you the right to serve me?

389
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,100
General, watch out!

390
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,510
General, I would've been dead

391
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,950
if you didn't save me back then.

392
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,990
I saved you,

393
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,750
and you saved me.

394
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,860
We are even.

395
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,190
General, you saved me due to your selflessness.

396
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,060
I saved you to repay the favor.

397
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,380
During the five years I served you,

398
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,670
you paid more attention to me than the others.

399
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,230
General, my life is yours.

400
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,820
You're the only person I'm willing
to dedicate my life to.

401
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,230
I'm glad you understand that.

402
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,510
Serve the Jing State well.

403
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,140
I will remember that.

404
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,060
I shall take my leave.

405
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,100
I saved you

406
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,140
to atone for my sin.

407
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,910
The 80,000 soldiers of the Di Troops
suffered tragic deaths on Qingnan Mountain.

408
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,230
I couldn't do anything about it.

409
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,620
The more people I can save on Qingnan Mountain,

410
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,950
[Qingnan Mountain]
the more I can atone for my sin.

411
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,140
Sir, you mentioned

412
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,030
that you couldn't find the Flower of Longing
in the capital.

413
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,270
I found its seeds for you.

414
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,950
Thank you, Linlang.

415
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,430
Plant them where there's most sunlight.

416
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,710
Okay.

417
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,230
Since they've arrived at Mutian Prefecture...

418
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,870
[Mutian Prefecture]

419
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,230
it's time for the show to begin.

420
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,100
Who's there?

421
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,950
Your Highness?

422
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:22,910
Ren Anle,

423
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,860
don't tell me you came here at this late hour

424
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,340
to talk about disaster relief.

425
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,580
Your Highness, I'll tell you why

426
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,620
once you've dried my hair for me.

427
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,710
I've never done it before.

428
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,950
Actually,

429
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,860
I'm here to greet your guest for you.

430
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,710
Jian Song already went to greet them.

431
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,190
What a coincidence.

432
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,190
Yuanshu is there too.

433
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,860
Jian Song is pretty good, huh?

434
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,820
Yuanshu is pretty good too.

435
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,430
Your Highness, you don't need to protect me.

436
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,190
Just stay near me.

437
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,470
Great move.

438
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,670
Your Highness, your move was pretty good too.

439
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,470
Wait. Keep them alive.

440
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,060
It was my negligence.

441
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,190
I hadn't stabbed them yet.

442
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,430
Why are they dead already?

443
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,190
They took poison and ended their own lives.

444
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,620
Your Highness, are you okay?

445
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,100
Did they hurt you?

446
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Young Lady, are you okay?

447
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,540
Your Highness,

448
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,580
all the assassins we subdued in the courtyard

449
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,470
took their own lives.

450
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,860
The mastermind didn't attempt
to take our lives before.

451
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,140
And now, the assassins he sent
all took their own lives

452
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,990
to not leave any evidence behind.

453
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,670
Your Highness, could this be...

454
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,950
This matter is over.

455
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,990
You should return to your studies.

456
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,950
What's going on?

457
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,580
Since His Highness is fine,

458
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,100
why don't you send me back, Mr. Wen?

459
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,380
Let's go.

460
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,670
So, Your Highness, when did you know

461
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,540
that they would come?

462
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,820
When we weren't obstructed

463
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,670
during our investigation this afternoon.

464
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,190
I think this assassination

465
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,780
should be plotted
by both Marquis Zhongyi and Zhong Liwen.

466
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,340
They chose to assassinate you in this inn.

467
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,980
They caused a huge commotion.

468
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,900
Besides, these assassins

469
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,750
were martial arts experts.

470
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,790
However, they were only targeting
the fan you were holding.

471
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,710
What a shame.

472
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,620
It was a pretty jade fan.

473
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,820
It's obvious that they didn't intend
to assassinate me here.

474
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,860
This is a warning.

475
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,270
You have a point.

476
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,950
Our trip to Jiangnan

477
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,140
is His Majesty's current priority.

478
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
If Your Highness and I

479
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,750
do die in Mutian Prefecture,

480
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,820
they'll get themselves in trouble.

481
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,340
That's only one of the possibilities.

482
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,180
There's a second possibility?

483
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,420
Marquis Zhongyi gets his way
by any means necessary.

484
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,270
If we do die here,

485
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,340
he can frame Zhong Liwen for our death.

486
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,860
So, you think...

487
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,030
Maybe the assassins

488
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,510
spared us on purpose.

489
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,380
We already tried our best to cover our tracks.

490
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,660
However, they still followed us
all the way to the inn.

491
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,100
It's obvious

492
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,140
that there's a spy among us.

493
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,380
My Lord,

494
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,620
did you really send assassins after them?

495
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,580
You're getting yourself into trouble here.

496
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,820
The Crown Prince is hiding in the dark
while Zhong Liwen is out in the open.

497
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,230
It's difficult for him to accomplish his task.

498
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,510
That's why you did this to reveal

499
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,510
the Crown Prince's whereabouts.

500
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,990
I already expected

501
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,180
the assassination to fail.

502
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,310
I'm sure the Crown Prince is unharmed.

503
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,860
What can he do about it?

504
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,510
After all, the plot after the assassination

505
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,230
is the true wedding gift I prepared

506
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,380
for Han Ye and Ren Anle.

507
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,990
Instead of letting them corner us,

508
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,030
why don't we put them on the spot?

509
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,580
Your Highness,

510
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,660
that's why I said we have great chemistry.

511
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,710
They did all of that

512
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,660
as a warning so that we would stop

513
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,950
doing things in the dark.

514
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,990
We'll reveal ourselves
and lay our cards on the table then.

515
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,380
Okay.

516
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,380
I don't think that's appropriate.

517
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,510
The disaster relief fund will only arrive
after five days.

518
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,230
Your Highness, if the flood victims
knew that you were here

519
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,140
and you didn't do anything to help them,

520
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,310
they would make a mess out of the situation.

521
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,660
Do you think Jiangnan

522
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,510
truly lacks food supply and money?

523
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,180
Wen Shuo,

524
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,660
relay my instructions.

525
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,900
Tell everyone to get changed

526
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,860
and prepare for the ceremonial procession.

527
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,510
I will let the officials of Mutian Prefecture

528
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,990
know that the Crown Prince is here

529
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,550
overnight.

530
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,270
Yes, Your Highness.

531
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,000
[Ping'an Inn]

532
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,470
(Forgive me, Your Highness.)

533
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,950
I had no idea Your Highness
was visiting Mutian Prefecture.

534
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,900
I was late in receiving Your Highness.

535
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,030
Not at all.

536
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,750
Official Zhong,
you're the official in charge here.

537
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,620
You must be busy with work.

538
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,660
It was my fault for not notifying you in time.

539
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,230
This is?

540
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,510
This is Official Ren Anle,
the minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

541
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,860
She's also an imperial envoy.

542
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,420
Official Ren.

543
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,750
This is a shabby inn.

544
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,420
Your Highness, Official Ren, I have prepared

545
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,230
a villa

546
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,900
for you two.

547
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,180
No need for that.

548
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,380
Mutian Prefecture was struck by a severe flood.

549
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,180
There's no need to waste any money on me.

550
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,620
Moreover,

551
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,580
Official Zhong, your outfit is plain and simple.

552
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,550
I assume you're used to living a frugal life.

553
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,660
Your Highness, thank you for understanding.

554
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,230
Mutian Prefecture had opened

555
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,140
its granary and distributed
all the grains we had

556
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,310
after the flood.

557
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,660
Our granary is empty now.

558
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,750
Luckily,

559
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,710
Your Highness and Official Ren
came here just in time.

560
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,790
You two have resolved

561
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,030
an urgent crisis
faced by all 15 prefectures and cities.

562
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,180
Is the government granary truly empty?

563
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,510
Your Highness, if you don't believe me,

564
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,860
I can open it for you.

565
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,310
Your Highness may take a look yourself.

566
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,230
Official Zhong, I was joking.

567
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,380
Naturally, I believe in you.

568
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,950
Official Zhong, if that was true,

569
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,230
how did the blood letter written by the people

570
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,420
end up in the capital then?

571
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,470
Official Ren, you may not know,

572
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,710
but Jiangnan is far from the capital.

573
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,380
Although they've just arrived here,

574
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,660
we have helped

575
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,140
almost all of them to settle down.

576
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,510
If that's the case,

577
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,230
does that mean we don't need to
distribute the disaster relief fund?

578
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,470
Not really.

579
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,230
We have to consider the disaster relief effort
from a long-term perspective.

580
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,470
The merchants in Mutian Prefecture

581
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,750
still have some grains with them.

582
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,420
That's why

583
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,270
I plan to hold a banquet in Wangjiang Terrace
with the gentries tomorrow.

584
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,900
Your Highness, Official Ren,

585
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,420
please head there together with me

586
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,750
to discuss the disaster relief effort.

587
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,380
Of course.

588
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,990
I don't think we can afford

589
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,380
the banquet in Wangjiang Terrace.

590
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,750
You're sponging off the Crown Prince right now.

591
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,470
I'm sure you can afford everything in the world.

592
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,230
I'm just a village girl.

593
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,510
Your Highness, please look after me

594
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,070
tomorrow.

595
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,550
Zhong Liwen is influential in Jiangnan.

596
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,380
He's also the brother-in-law of Marquis Zhongyi.

597
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,470
Tomorrow,

598
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,860
you better keep yourself in check.

599
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,710
We need to depend on him

600
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,790
for what we wish to achieve in Jiangnan.

601
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,750
What are you trying to do here?

602
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,510
Your Highness, it's been a long day for you.

603
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,900
Naturally, I will help you

604
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
to remove your clothes.

605
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,990
You were usually an unreasonable brute.

606
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,230
I never expected you to be so gentle in private.

607
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,140
Indeed.

608
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,620
I'm seeing you in a different light now.

609
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,750
Your Highness wouldn't have forgotten about

610
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,620
Di Ziyuan, who you waited ten years for,

611
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,140
if it weren't for my thoughtfulness.

612
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,580
You wouldn't have fallen for me by then.

613
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,750
That's right.

614
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,750
My ten years of longing.

615
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,750
It's all in the past now.

616
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,230
Your Highness, are you speaking the truth?

617
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:10,910
Your Highness!

618
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,950
Your Highness!

619
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,990
Your Highness.

620
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,660
Mind your behavior,

621
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,740
Ren Anle.

622
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,100
Zhong Liwen always sends his men here

623
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,430
at the wrong time.

624
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,070
They come and go at the wrong time.

625
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,700
I thought

626
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,950
Your Highness would treat me sincerely

627
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,990
after receiving my thoughtful service.

628
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,070
Ren Anle!

629
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,390
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

630
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,660
Even if I was being ridiculous,

631
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,140
you did put on an act together with me,

632
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,950
Your Highness.

633
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,140
Sir, you're back.

634
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,910
How did it go?

635
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,030
His Highness is quite approachable.

636
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,660
However, Ren Anle

637
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,070
is a tough nut to crack.

638
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,950
But I believe

639
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,700
that stubborn officials like her
will crack under pressure eventually.

640
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,990
She doesn't want to take
the delicacies we offer her, huh?

641
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,300
Don't tell me she wants to try
the bland porridge we make for the victims?

642
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,180
Since His Highness

643
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,510
wants to render merit here,

644
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,100
we should

645
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,910
do a beautiful job and help him out.

646
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
By doing so, we're rendering merit too.

647
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,910
But what about Marquis Zhongyi?

648
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,510
As for Marquis Zhongyi,
I'll explain it to him myself.

649
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,740
Let's prepare a backup plan

650
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,580
by holding a banquet first

651
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,910
to show our sincerity.

652
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,260
Otherwise...

653
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,300
Time to enjoy a show.

654
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,550
Let's see how His Highness

655
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,070
is responsible for causing a riot

656
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,830
after arriving in Jiangnan.

657
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,990
It's difficult to raise funds and supplies
for the disaster relief effort.

658
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,870
Zhong Liwen is holding a banquet

659
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,550
so that he can use the disaster relief fund I have

660
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,070
to buy the extra grains
from those wealthy merchants.

661
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,780
However, those grains were supposed
to be in the imperial granary.

662
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:23,990
In the end,

663
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,260
they'll get their hands

664
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,780
on the fund.

665
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,780
His deceptive plan is brilliant indeed.

666
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:32,950
Official Zhong

667
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,510
is a good strategist, huh?

668
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,870
Gu Yunnian sees you as a thorn in his flesh.

669
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,910
And Zhong Liwen will definitely
defame you during the banquet.

670
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,550
But Your Highness

671
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,350
looks very composed.

672
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,220
I'm sure you have your own plans.

673
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,830
Ren Anle,

674
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,510
you're my bosom friend indeed.

675
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,350
Bosom friend?

676
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,260
A bosom friend who is at your beck and call?

677
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,470
It's fine. I'm thick-skinned.

678
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,140
I'm your bosom friend

679
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,070
as long as Your Highness says so.

680
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,100
However, Your Highness,
can you agree to my request

681
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,580
if I have any?

682
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,140
Ren Anle...

683
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,830
It's like this.

684
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,870
Your Highness,

685
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,990
I just hope that you can address me

686
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,510
as Beauty.

687
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,550
Beauty.

688
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,140
Okay. From now on, that's my rank.

689
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,740
Your Highness, you already said yes.

690
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,620
This tea is nice.

691
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,740
A straight needle one cun beyond Chize

692
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,700
can relieve coldness and cough.

693
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,700
A diagonal needle one cun beyond Bingfeng
can invigorate the blood and qi.

694
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,430
I learned this technique
from a famous physician in the capital.

695
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,260
Sir, your body will definitely recover
if you can take this treatment

696
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,350
once every three days.

697
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,350
Sir, the treatment is complete.

698
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,070
It's a congenital disease.

699
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,140
I'm afraid such treatments are useless.

700
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,430
The Flower of Longing, which was a fragile plant,

701
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,030
(could still survive
even when I brought it to the capital.)

702
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,830
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]
(Sir, you'll definitely be fine.)

703
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,430
Sir,

704
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,430
the Flower of Longing is sprouting.

705
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,700
The Flower of Longing comes from Jingnan.
It fears the cold.

706
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,830
I couldn't make it sprout

707
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,830
no matter how I planted it.

708
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,990
Linlang,

709
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,830
you're much more adept at it than me.

710
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,260
Sir,

711
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,390
Princess Anning is here again.

712
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,070
She's drinking in the room downstairs.

713
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,950
Excellent dance.

714
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,470
You look quite pretty.

715
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,700
You're quite the beauty.

716
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,220
What's your name?

717
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,470
My name is Wanyi.

718
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,550
Wanyi?

719
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,550
Excellent name.

720
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,510
You look pretty too.

721
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,830
What's your name?

722
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,220
My name is Zhiluo.

723
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,830
I'm Lengbei.

724
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,300
Ma'am, you've drunk too much.

725
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,220
Who said you could stand so close to me?

726
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,030
All of you may leave.

727
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,070
General.

728
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,870
Official Luo.

729
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,870
One can rarely engage Linlang and her services
even if they're wealthy.

730
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,550
Official Luo,

731
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,830
you're really lucky.

732
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,580
Is this

733
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,740
"Withering Plum Blossom"?

734
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,300
General, do you still remember this song?

735
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,030
Naturally.

736
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
Ziyuan learned guqin together with me
when we were young.

737
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,950
However, she loved martial arts.

738
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,350
She couldn't master the guqin
even after learning it for several months.

739
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,910
In the end, she only managed

740
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,870
to learn this song

741
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,430
under the Crown Prince's guidance.

742
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,430
I heard

743
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,740
that fresh flowers

744
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,870
do not grow on Dai Mountain.

745
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,430
There are merely birds chirping

746
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,990
during summer and fall.

747
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,580
It's a desolate place

748
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,830
where nothing thrives.

749
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,620
She's lived there alone

750
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,180
for ten years.

751
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,390
We parted ways for ten years.

752
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,300
Actually, I miss her too.

753
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,100
She'll return to the capital soon.

754
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,030
Aren't you curious

755
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:38,780
about what she looks like

756
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
after ten years?
