26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,740
Bow.

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,540
[Han Zi'an's Tomb]
I thought Your Highness

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,700
was asking me to bow to you.

29
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,700
Why did Your Highness

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,900
bring me here?

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,860
The inscription on the tombstone

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,140
is left by the head of the Di family.

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,260
The late Founding Emperor stated in his will
that he wants to be buried in Cang Mountain alone.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,740
Aside from the descendants
of the Han and Di families,

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,420
outsiders are not allowed.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,100
Not even the Empress Dowager?

37
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,140
His Majesty commented

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,100
that His Late Majesty's action was preposterous.

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,140
It caused controversy over the imperial family.

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,940
Looking in this direction,

41
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,060
there's Jingnan.

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,340
Considering what you've mentioned earlier,

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,100
since Your Highness brought me here,

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,460
isn't that against tradition?

45
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,340
I want His Late Majesty to have a look at you.

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,500
His Late Majesty must be pleased.

48
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,500
I can foresee

49
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,020
that we'd bring the Jing State
to greater heights together.

50
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,420
We wish the Crown Prince
a safe journey back to the capital.

51

We wish the Crown Prince
a safe journey back to the capital.

52
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,700
Your Highness

53
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
meant more than that, right?

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,260
You're indeed capable.

55
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,100
The imperial court would not let this slide.

56
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,980
After we're back in the capital,

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
I'll officially report to His Majesty

58
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
that the credits of disaster relief

59
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,860
and the finding of evidence
of Zhong Liwen's corruption

60
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,740
belong to you.

61
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,420
You're aware that I've offended Marquis Zhongyi,

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,140
but you still want to officially report
to His Majesty for me, Your Highness.

63
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,820
You're forcing me

64
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,260
to side with you

65
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,300
and support you from now on, Your Highness.

67
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,300
You're already involved in this tumult.

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,740
And you can't escape it.

69
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,700
As the Crown Prince, I would like

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,660
to ask you to stay by my side.

71
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,740
You refuse to marry me,

72
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,700
yet you're trying to tie me up with you.

73
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,740
Do you still remember, Your Highness?

74
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,540
I told you previously.

75
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,540
As long as it's your wish,

76
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,860
I'd try my best to fulfill it.

77
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Since Your Highness wants to be friends,

78
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,260
let's be friends then.

79
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
As your friend,

80
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,300
I should be content

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,260
that I'm visiting
this imperial restricted area, Your Highness.

82
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,860
I'm glad

83
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,140
that you agree with this.

84
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,580
Although I can't be the Crown Princess,

85
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,420
I'll still try my best to achieve it.

86
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,140
We can still join sides

87
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,540
even if we're not married.

88
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,220
What about my betrothal gift
of the 30,000 naval forces?

89
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,700
I won't give up on that easily.

90
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,180
Your Highness.

91
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,020
That is not my way of doing things.

92
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,940
Even if I can't be the Crown Princess,

93
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,900
I want to stay close to you.

94
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,940
I would like to see whom you'd fall in love with.

95
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
It's that restless someone.

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,460
You're agile, Your Highness.

97
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,980
You're better than me.

98
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,100
I knew Your Highness would come
to Cang Mountain today.

99
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,340
I didn't expect that Official Ren

100
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,340
would be the surprise

101
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,340
in my plan.

102
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,340
I didn't expect this either.

103
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,100
We're both tricked by His Highness.

104
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,780
Your Highness.

105
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,540
What a good move.

106
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,420
You're killing two birds with one stone.

107
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,660
Your Highness tricked me
into coming to Cang Mountain.

108
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Why did Your Highness use yourself as bait

109
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,580
just to lure me out?

110
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,980
You're the leader
of Marquis Zhongyi's hidden guard,

111
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,340
the expert swordsman of the Jing State.

112
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,100
When did Your Highness discover my identity?

113
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,100
You served me for seven years.

114
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,420
I trusted you indeed.

115
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,660
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

116
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,980
become my personal bodyguard

117
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,220
and led the Imperial Guards
of Crown Prince's Residence.

118
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,660
However, during the trip to Jiangnan,

119
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,340
Marquis Zhongyi has been too impatient.

120
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,100
You must give this

121
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,340
to Luo Mingxi,
the Minister of Justice, in two days.

122
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,900
[To Mingxi, Minister of Justice]
Yes, Your Highness.

123
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,460
He has left.

124
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,340
When did Your Highness
find out that he's suspicious?

125
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,580
The night of my assassination.

126
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,020
I told you

127
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,460
that we have a mole among us.

128
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,100
The ones who stay close to us
are Yuanqin, Yuanshu,

129
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,980
Wen Shuo, Jili,

130
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,100
and Jian Song.

131
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,780
The day when I acquired
the rice shop's ledgers,

132
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,780
I told him about the location

133
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,980
of the copper mine with a four-hour difference.

134
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,220
If anyone among them

135
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,780
is a mole...

136
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,340
Zhong Liwen would take action that night.

137
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,100
I see.

138
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,220
The assassination

139
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,340
wasn't meant to kill me and Anle.

140
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,100
It was a warning.

141
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
It was you, right?

142
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,340
Your Highness

143
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,580
discovered my talent and gave me opportunities.

144
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,780
Yet you still betrayed me.

145
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,340
I owe Marquis Zhongyi a favor too.

146
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,220
I have to do this.

147
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,060
Your Highness.

148
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,380
Take that.

149
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,620
He's no match for Han Ye.

150
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,140
Your Highness.

151
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,180
You're kind and lenient to me,

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,820
so you can't kill me.

153
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,820
I know

154
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,380
that you've been my friend for seven years.

155
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
It's worthwhile

156
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,940
knowing Your Highness!

157
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,260
Your Highness has expected this all along.

158
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,260
So, you didn't bring any of your guards
to Cang Mountain,

159
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,820
as you meant to spare his life.

160
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,060
However,

161
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
he was too proud,

162
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,020
and he refused to be much obliged to me.

163
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,620
He was obliged to Your Highness.

164
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,780
Otherwise, you'd be hurt, Your Highness.

165
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,020
Come on.

166
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,020
Your Highness.

167
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,740
We now call each other friends.

168
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,540
One day, if I turned against you,

169
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,420
what would you do, Your Highness?

170
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,340
Ren Anle.

171
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,140
If you doubt a person, do not use him.

172
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,260
If you use a man, do not doubt him.

173
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,740
I'm willing to believe in you.

174
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,220
The Crown Prince brought Ren Anle
to visit the late Founding Emperor's tomb?

175
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,340
That's right.

176
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Is Ren Anle right about this?

177
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,260
That she helped to solve
the Crown Prince's problems,

178
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,260
so the Crown Prince has fallen in love with her.

179
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,260
Zhao Fu.

180
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,260
Why are you laughing? Be honest with me.

181
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,620
I dare not, Your Majesty.

182
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,660
I'll pardon you.

183
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,740
Think about it, Your Majesty.

184
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,140
Official Ren went on the Jiangnan trip.

185
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,420
She offends

186
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,540
Marquis Zhongyi's party again.

187
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,020
If His Highness

188
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,380
is really in love with Official Ren...

189
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,780
The Crown Prince abhors what is evil.

190
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,420
I always knew

191
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,900
that he's upset with Gu Yunnian.

192
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,500
He's trying to cow Gu Yunnian now.

193
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,420
Although he offends the official,

194
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,500
he builds his reputation
among the citizens as a just crown prince.

195
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,780
If so,

196
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,020
His Highness and Official Ren make a good team.

197
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,340
They didn't disappoint Your Majesty indeed.

198
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,900
The Crown Prince has my support.

199
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
However, Ren Anle has made a tough enemy.

200
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,020
If she only has the Crown Prince's support,

201
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,260
she's skating on thin ice.

202
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,780
What is your plan, Your Majesty?

203
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,260
After they return to the capital,

204
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,900
I need to discuss this with the Crown Prince.

205
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,420
Yes.

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,420
has arrived safely at Jiangnan

214

216
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,740
Well done.

217
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,540
How would you deal with Zhong Liwen?

218
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,340
It's rumored that Zhong Liwen

219
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,620
likes to find fault with those who disobey him.

220
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,340
What about we

221
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,660
make him a pair of shoes made of steel?

222
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Let him be in the shoes of those men
and taste his own medicine.

223
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,380
You're trying to please Official Ren, right?

224
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Zhong Liwen has always been opposing Ren Anle.

225
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,260
Now that he's in my hands,

226
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,260
I won't let him off easily.

227
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
However, Official Ren has affected

228
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,380
Gu Yunnian's influence in Jiangnan.

229
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,700
If she returns to the capital,

230
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,020
he will surely take revenge on her.

231
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm worried about this too.

232
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,380
So, I sent someone

233
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,660
to submit a memorial to Han Zhongyuan.

234
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,660
Our forces

235

don't have enough power to protect Anle now.

That's right.

245

Lately, there has been a decrease

246
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,780
in the number
of officials visiting our residence.

247
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,780
They're afraid that they'd end up like Zhong Liwen.

248
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,900
How foolish of them.

249

If I fall,

to us recklessly.

What about Ren Anle?

When we were at the peak of Cang Mountain,

How did you find out about my trick then?

276

Well, that's because

277
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,300
you were honest with me.

279
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,780
Ever since you claimed

that you brought your naval forces
as your betrothal gift for me,

281
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,980

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
owes you a favor.

370
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,480
In addition, we've finally

371
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,620
fostered our influence in Jiangnan.

372
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,940
The credits belong to me, Han Ye,

373
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,980
and you, who's staying away from the limelight.

374
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,980
What have you found during the trip to Jiangnan?

375
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,220
I followed the trace of the lotus silver pendant.

376
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,140
I found an old scholar named Zhong Hai.

377
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,380
Unfortunately, it has been ages.

378
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,060
He's nowhere to be found.

379
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,900
However, in the flower vase
in Zhong Liwen's residence,

380
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,100
we found the name list of the 80,000 soldiers.

381
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,620
There are ten survivors.

382
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,100
Their names have been circled.

383
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,940
Zhong Hai is one of them.

384
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,780
Looks like Zhong Hai is crucial.

385
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,100
I'll have Qianyue Pavilion investigate this.

386
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,620
Anle.

387
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,220
Half the officials

388
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,140
of the imperial court are siding with us.

389
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,140
Even if you don't join
the Crown Princess selection, you could still...

390
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,420
My father once said,

391
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,340
if one wants to rule the world,

392
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,860
he needs power and the people's support.

393
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,420
When I, Di Ziyuan, disguise myself as Ren Anle,

394
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm using myself as bait.

395
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,740
If I don't step into this tumult,

396
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,740
how can I cause a commotion in the capital,

397
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,180
make the culprits drop their guard

398
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,580
and give themselves away?

399
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,340
Only then can I get closer to the truth.

400
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,340
But I'm scared that you might
get too invested in this

401
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,740
and forgot about the revenge.

402
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,940
Han Ye has managed the flood at Jiangnan well.

403
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,580
Regardless of his breadth of mind or wisdom,

404
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,420
he'd be a good ruler.

405
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,340
The Han family

406
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,340
annihilated the 80,000 soldiers

407
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
and my entire family.

408
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,420
He's

409
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,180
Han Ye.

410
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,060
I'm glad that you understand.

411
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,180
[Yuchen Hall]

412
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,940
I was talking
about the Crown Princess selection,

413
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,180
yet you're talking about Ren Anle.

414
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,180
Since you're well aware of the issue,

415
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,180
you should know that it's all Ren Anle's credits.

416
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,420
Did you know that before you came,

417
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,860
[Grand Historian, Wei Guan's report. Gu Yunnian]
the Minister of Justice and Gu Yunnian

418
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,580
were here to claim credits for Ren Anle?

419
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,860
She's here for the Crown Princess selection.

420
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,820
However, along her way,

421
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,940
she offends Gu Yunnian.

422
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,580
No matter if her only agenda is to marry you,

423
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,740
this woman

424
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,820
isn't simple.

425
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,060
I've allowed her to join
the Crown Princess selection.

426
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,300
She's yours now.

427
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,580
Please take care of her.

428
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

429
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,180
However, I still want to say

430
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,340
-that I'm not...
-Hold on.

431
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,180
I'll host a celebratory feast today.

432
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,420
You can save your words

433
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,620
for Ren Anle.

434
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,460
Your Highness.

435
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,100
Your Highness.

436
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,540
Can't you see me, Your Highness?

437
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,860
Here, Official Ren.

438
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,620
Cheers.

439
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,620
How is the dissection method

440
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,620
for the Ministry of Justice?

441
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,940
Your method is really helpful.

442
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,540
I officially reported to His Majesty

443
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,780
as I hope to work with you, Official Ren.

444
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,300
Don't let those matters of the heart

445
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,900
affect your career.

446
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,140
Well, I can't help it.

447
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
I'm all about romantic affairs.

448
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,460
Looks like

449
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,900
I'd let you down, Official Luo.

450
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,540
Besides, I'm the one who suggested

451
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,780
the Crown Princess selection.

452
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,300
If I quit before the selection,

453
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,140
all my efforts will be in vain.

454
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
Am I right, Your Highness?

455
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,540
Your Highness.

456
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
You criticized my tea etiquette.

457
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,900
Why are you sipping the tea like this now?

458
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,220
I...

459
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,620
Official Ren.

460
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,780
Congratulations.

461
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,780
Even the Marquis is congratulating me.

462
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
I'm really flattered.

463
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,220
You're too humble, Official Ren.

464
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,980
Everyone who's present

465
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,380
has experienced your capability.

466
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,980
Well...

467
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,620
Aside from you, My Lord.

468
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,460
You need to be careful.

469
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,140
Who knows, one day you'd experience it too.

470
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,380
You've successfully solved some cases.

471
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,860
You should thank me for that too.

472
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,380
You're right, My Lord.

473
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
Gu Qishan and Zhong Liwen

474
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,380
have become my stepping stones.

475
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,420
Speaking of which,

476
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,420
here's to you, My Lord.

477
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,220
This

478
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,140
goes to your daughter.

479
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,980
May she aid me in being selected
as the Crown Princess.

480
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,780
Ren Anle.

481
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,140
This is the main hall of the Imperial Palace.

482
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,220
So?

483
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,860
We're not on good terms.

484
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,460
Why can't I upset him, so he'd act recklessly?

485
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,900
Perhaps we could gain something.

486
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,620
Come on, Official Luo.

487
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,100
Cheers.

488
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:25,070
[Ren's Residence]

489
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,380
We've arrived.

490
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,380
It's your fault. You couldn't drink

491
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,140
and you didn't drink on my behalf.

492
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,980
So, I'm drunk.

493
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,540
You're not drunk.

494
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,060
Stop pretending.

495
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,140
Get up.

496
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,380
Aren't you pretending as well?

497
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,620
Ren Anle. Stop using

498
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,620
the Crown Princess position as your excuse.

499
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:54,980
Excuse?

500
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,140
We've been through so much together.

501
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,260
Do you still think like that?

502
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,380
Although I lost
to the late Founding Emperor's will,

503
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,140
I didn't lose to Di Ziyuan.

504
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,900
No matter what you say,

505
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,620
she's going to leave the mountain soon.

506
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,700
We must observe the etiquette.

507
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,100
Who said that then?

508
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,540
When we were at the inn in Jiangnan,

509
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,100
you said that a decade of dwelling
stays in the past.

510
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,780
I would see Ziyuan every day from now on.

511
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,620
Of course the dwellings
will eventually turn into bygones.

512
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,100
I didn't expect Your Highness
to go back on your word.

513
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,780
Ren Anle.

514
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,700
I must keep my promise and protect her.

515
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,540
I don't care!

516
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,540
Let's go to the Ministry of Justice.

517
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,540
Yes.

518
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,540
I didn't expect Your Highness

519
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,620
to visit me at this hour.

520
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,780
As friends,

521
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,300
can't I visit without notice?

522
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,940
We can grow closer to each other
or grow apart from each other.

523
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,620
What would we be, Your Highness?

524
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,220
That's a question.

525
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,980
When I was in Jiangnan, I thought

526
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,380
that it'd be great if you were there.

527
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,700
Then, I could talk to you

528
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
about my problems.

529
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
You could have intimate conversations
with Ren Anle too.

530
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,300
Am I right, Your Highness?

531
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,140
I can't tell her about it. Not at all.

532
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,620
Why not?

533
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,300
She didn't know what happened a decade ago.

534
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,900
However, Ren Anle is smart,
so she'd understand it right away.

535
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,980
How would she not understand you, Your Highness?

536
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,220
As for you, Your Highness,

537
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,460
the more you insist,

538
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,460
the more doubtful you sound.

539
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,620
That's not the case.

540
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,300
Yes, it is.

541
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,900
Luo Mingxi.

542
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,860
I admire her character and talent, that's all.

543
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,220
Aren't you the same?

544
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
So, Your Highness is visiting me

545
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
to ask about

546
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,900
why I claimed credits on Ren Anle's behalf.

547
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,860
I was just wondering.

548
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,100
Why do you care about Ren Anle so much too?

549
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,980
"Too"?

550
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,540

and comes to the capital,

588

she'd be everyone's target.

590

from the Di family to leave the mountain.

The bigger the mess, the better it is.

597
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,460
The orphaned girl of the Di family
must never leave the mountain.

We were ordered
to confiscate the Di family's assets.

The orphaned girl of the Di family
saw everything.

601

[Marquis Zhongyi]
If she returns to the capital,

602
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
she'd surely take her revenge on us.

603
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,780
She's just an orphaned girl.

604
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,100
She's incapable of that.

605
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,900
Moreover, there are people who don't wish

606
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,380
to see her here.

607
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,340
Even if His Majesty agrees,

608

are recommending your daughters.

Perhaps your daughter

613
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,980
would be the Crown Princess.

is the state's priority.

They're really oblivious.

to Di Cheng'en to leave the mountain?

Di Ziyuan could leave the mountain

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,220
I will take this book.

732
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,460
Your Highness?

733
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,660
This book is meaningful to me.

734
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,100
Can you go with another one?

735
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,940
I'll buy you whichever you want.

736
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,980
Another book?

737
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,700
Your Highness always promises me
something I don't want.

738
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,980
What's the rule of Anle Abode?

739
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,260
We want it, and we get it.

740
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,500
If we can't get it,

741
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,460
we snatch it.

742
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,540
Hence, I must get this book.

743
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,500
You can have this gold

744
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,220
if you want.

745
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,180
Yes.

746
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,980
Anle.

747
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,940
This book is useful to His Highness.

748
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,300
I can pay you twice the gold.

749
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,220
Do you think that we're poor?

750
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,700
Ren Anle.

751
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,100
If you really like it,

752
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,660
I can produce a copy of this book for you. Okay?

753
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,100
Well,

754
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm okay with that.

755
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,700
However, you must tell me

756
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,100
why you must get this book.

757
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,980
This was the belonging of Ziyuan's late father.

758
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,220
So I'm getting this for her.

759
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,900
So, it's for my love rival.

760
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,540
All the more reason why I can't let you have it.

761
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,060
Give it to me.

762
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,860
Take it if you can.

763
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,300
Stop it, Ren Anle.

764
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,580
You need to catch it, Your Highness.

765
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,660
Catch it if you can.

766
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,300
My gosh.

767
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,020
I'm sorry, sir.

768
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,420
Stop laughing.

769
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,580
Clean up the mess.

770
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,660
Let's go.

771
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,180
Come on.

772
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,620
Ren Anle.

773
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,860
Listen.

774
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,660
I know that you're a good friend

775
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,380
who tells right from wrong.

776
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,580
This book contains
Ziyuan's father's handwriting.

777
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,580
His Majesty ordered Ziyuan

778
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,180
to change her name so as to leave the mountain.

779
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,300
If she decides not to obey,

780
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,580
she can have this book as a temporary comfort.

781
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,860
I heard that Your Highness

782
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,580
has sent her

783
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,380
loads of books throughout the decade.

784
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,660
What if she's lazy

785
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,860
to read through the books?

786
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,180
She won't.

787
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,700
Are you sure?

788
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,100
When Ziyuan was little,

789
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,580
she was already smart and hardworking.

790
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,140
Yet, she's imprisoned on Dai Mountain for a decade.

791
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,460
Let alone reading books,

792
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,860
I'd be lazy to even utter a word.

793
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,420
You're not her.

794
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,980
You will never understand.

795
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,580
When Your Highness talks about Di Ziyuan,

796
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,940
you're boring.

797
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,140
If she doesn't leave the mountain,

798
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,660
I'd be at an advantage.

799
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,100
How about this?

800
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,420
If she doesn't leave the mountain,
I'll return this to the rightful owner.

801
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,100
Deal?

802
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,700
Let's see if she'd leave the mountain.

803
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,260
A table for two esteemed guests.

804
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,540
[Don't simply use an official.]
(It's indeed your handwriting.)

805
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,060
(Father.)

806
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,980
(I'll surely clear the Di family's name.)
