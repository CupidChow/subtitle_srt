[Episode 23]

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
Han Zhongyuan is vile and cruel.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,440
The whole Di family
would've been wiped out completely.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,840
Han Ye did all he could to save you.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,640
For that, he was imprisoned in the palace
by Han Zhongyuan.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
The suffering was unspeakable.

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,920
I didn't know Han Ye took such a great risk

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,920
to keep me alive.

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm not telling you this

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,640
so someone can have your gratitude.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,720
I want you to know the truth

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
and make the choice.

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
Will you take your revenge

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,440
or put an end to it?

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,040
If you want to continue on this path,

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,200
you will owe him for his sacrifice.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,720
You will forever be in his debt.

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
It doesn't matter how much anyone sacrificed

42
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,280
because of the massacre of the Di family.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,080
It won't stop me from taking revenge.

You need not worry.

After we got out of the valley today,

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,960
Han Ye and I agreed to never cross paths again.

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,840
Very well.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,920
If you're determined,

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,200

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,160
Your Highness, you're still recovering.

You can't drink.

Go inside and get some rest.

You're already Ren Anle.

150
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,420
But can you maintain this identity?

151

-we...
-Anning.

for old times' sake.

164
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,660
You came with a motive.

165
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,380

171
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,820
I know the Han family
has wronged the Di family terribly.

172
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,300
Let me be the one
to atone for their sins, will you?

173
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,820
Anning, the blame is not with you.

174
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,740
Ziyuan, I am a sinner.

175
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,660
You should know that I...

176
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,900
I...

177
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,260
Ziyuan,

178
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,660
if there's anything you want,

179
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
tell me.

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,220
I'll get it done for you.

181
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,780
Anning.

182

The Di family

183
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,020
and 80,000 wronged souls,

184
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,260
it's too heavy a sin for you alone.

00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,700
You should know the consequences

371
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,900
of standing against me.

372
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,500
What do you want from me?

373
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,740
As long as you behave yourself,

374
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,740
you can be the Crown Princess
without any worries.

375
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,260
No one will ever

376
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,940
learn of your real identity.

377
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,620
After all,

378
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,860
the last resort isn't going to benefit

379
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,380
either of us.

380
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,740
Can I trust you?

381
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,740
Why would I lie to you?

382
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,980
Very well.

383
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,740
I understand.

384
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,500
I bet you already know

385
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,500
his real identity.

386
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,620
Yes.

387
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,300
From now on, he works for you.

388
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,100
What's wrong?

389
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,620
You don't want him?

390
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,100
If that's the case,

391
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,820
I can take his life right now.

392
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,020
No!

393
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,260
No.

394
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,380
I want him.

395
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,980
Miss Linlang.

396
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,500
This song is too melancholic.

397
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,500
I'm tearing up because of it.

398
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
It's not my intention

399
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
for you to feel that way.

400
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,260
It's you who feel sadness

401
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,260
to have seen the sadness in it.

402
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,340
I used the best man in the world for my bidding.

403
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,140
But I don't regret it.

404
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,140
He is innocent

405
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,420
because he knows nothing about the past.

406
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,060
He is not innocent

407
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,180
because he bears the surname of Han.

408
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,100
He will become the Emperor of Jing.

409
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
The throne he will succeed...

410
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,420
It was built upon the 80,000 lost souls
of the Di family.

411
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,060
Therefore, I don't regret it.

412
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,260
I don't regret it.

413
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I don't regret it.

414
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,260
Official Ren.

415
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
There's another person

416
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,540
who's kept you safe for so many years.

417
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,660
Have you ever intoxicated yourself
because of him?

418
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,260
Who were you meeting just now?

419
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,140
It was Official Luo. You saw everything.

420
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,540
Even now, you still lie to me.

421
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,020
You keep plenty of secrets and thoughts

422
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,900
to yourself too.

423
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,860
You rarely laughed as a kid.

424
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,220
To cheer you up,

425
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,660
I practiced calligraphy and weiqi day and night.

426
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,060
I thought you were cold to me
so I'd become better.

427
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,540
But what was on your mind then?

428
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,860
You wholeheartedly thought

429
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,540
I was someone else.

430
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,780
It was for your own good.

431
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,260
Had I not done it,

432
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,020
you would've died.

433
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,580
But you were never honest with me.

434
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,540
Ever since we were children,
I've seen you as my only family.

435
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,100
I told you my secrets and woes.

436
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,020
But what did you do afterward?

437
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,500
You turned everything I've said and done
into secret letters.

438
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,580
You used my love for you

439
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
to display your loyalty to your master!

440
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,900
I was born a suicide warrior for the Luo family.

441
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,300
I don't have a choice.

442
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,540
I was born an orphaned beggar.

443
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,500
But I got this far.

444
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,620
Mu Qing.

445
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,780
Stop making excuses
for your hypocritical affection.

446
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,780
Whether you believe it or not,

447
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,380
I do care about you

448
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,660
and worry about you.

449
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,260
I mean it when I say
I'll forever be your guardian.

450
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,780
The date of the wedding is fixed.

451
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,620
It's certain that you'll be the Crown Princess.

452
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,180
There's no need to risk your life again.

453
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,660
You got what you wanted.

454
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,380
You don't need me anymore.

455
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,420
Stop!

456
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,100
I saved you

457
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,900
from Luo Mingxi's hand.

458
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,300
I won't so easily let go

459
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,780
of what I have in my grasp.

460
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
When I weaved this tassel,

461
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,140
I meant it.

462
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,900
(There are others in this city)

463
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,660
(who knows my real identity,)

464
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,780
(that I am not Di Ziyuan.)

465
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,060
(There are still uncertainties.)

466
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,980
(No. I must speak with His Majesty.)

467
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Cheng'en.

468
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
You were a daughter of a sinned official.

469
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,180
And now, I confer you the title
of the Crown Princess of Jing.

470
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,540
Do not leave me disappointed.

471
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,780
I am humbled.

472
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,380
I'm grateful for Your Majesty's kindness.

473
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,780
I will

474
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,020
announce the sins of my family

475
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,900
in the conferring ceremony.

476
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,980
I will fulfill the ceremony afterward.

477
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,300
Is that what you have in mind?

478
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,500
Everything I have

479
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,860
was gifted by Your Majesty.

480
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,860
To announce your mercy and kindness to the world

481
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,580
will be a great honor to me.

482
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,260
Very well.

483
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,900
Seeing how sincere you are,

484
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,540
I shall grant you permission.

485
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,300
Much obliged.

486
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,650
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

487
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,380
Greetings, Official Luo.

488
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,060
Who is this?

489
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,740
It's you, Official Ren.

490
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,540
Thank you, Official Ren.

491
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
I would've died that day

492
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,140
on Wuliu Street

493
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,340
had you not saved me from the fire.

494
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,020
I saved you for a reason.

495
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,780
Whatever you need.

496
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,300
You were born in Jingnan.

497
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,740
You were a former servant of the Di family.

498
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,060
Is that right?

499
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,140
There must be a misunderstanding.

500
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,260
How could I be a former servant of the Di family?

501
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,980
Take a look at this silver pendant.

502
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,900
Do you recognize it?

503
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,780
Official Ren.

504
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,300
This silver pendant belongs to me.

505
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,300
But what does it prove?

506
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,500
This lotus silver pendant

507
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,900
belonged to the Di family.

508
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,180
You accused me of being

509
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,180
the family's former servant
because of a mere pendant?

510
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,980
That's a hasty assumption.

511
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,380
Zhong Hai.

512
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,540
You were the former herald of the Di Troops.

513
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,140
After the battle at Qingnan City ten years ago,

514
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,740
you fled to Jiangnan and hid your name.

515
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,580
You couldn't prove your identity,

516
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,460
so no one would take you in.

517
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,420
Only the Zhong family

518
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,740
took pity on you

519
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,380
and showed you kindness.

520
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,780
You've served them for ten years.

521
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,740
That is why you'd risk

522
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,020
exposing your real identity

523
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,580
to prove the Zhong family's innocence.

524
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,060
We've been keeping an eye on you.

525
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,860
Yes.

526
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,740
I did serve the Di family.

527
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,780
If the two of you want to arrest me,

528
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,020
I shall have no complaints.

529
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,740
Zhong Hai, tell me.

530
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,780
Were the Di Troops traitors?

531
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,020
Certainly not!

532
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,020
The Di Troops were loyal to their bones.

533
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,100
They were never traitors.

534
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,260
If they weren't traitors,

535
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,100
raise your head.

536
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,140
Official Ren.

537
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,980
Even if I know we aren't traitors,

538
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,380
what does it matter?

539
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,260
Will you keep living in hiding

540
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,460
for the rest of your life?

541
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,420
I won't!

542
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,420
But the evidence was compelling.

543
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,260
His Majesty ordered

544
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,100
to make the 80,000 soldiers
of the Di Troops to be traitors.

545
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,300
The entire Di family was executed,

546
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,740
leaving an orphaned girl behind.

547
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,860
Even the daughter
has changed her name to "Di Cheng'en".

548
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,660
What can a mere soldier like me do?

549
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,660
This matter was buried along with the dead.

550
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,580
No one will bring it up again.

551
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,820
Loyal and righteous officers were framed.

552
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,100
All 80,000 soldiers were killed.

553
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,580
That is not the justice of this world.

554
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,340
The truth will prevail.

555
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,140
I thank you on behalf of my brothers.

556
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,100
I didn't think anyone

557
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,660
would still remember us.

558
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,980
However,

559
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,340
no one would dare investigate
this case ten years ago.

560
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,180
That hasn't changed now.

561
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,180
We are already dead to the world.

562
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,780
We died ten years ago
at the foot of Qingnan Mountain.

563
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,900
You've had a smooth career in the imperial court.

564
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,140
You need not stick your head out for us.

565
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,980
If I were only Ren Anle,

566
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,780
I could keep doing my job

567
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,500
and wait for my promotion.

568
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,100
But I am Marquis Jing'an's daughter.

569
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,020
Ten years ago, my name was Di Ziyuan.

570
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,620
Di Ziyuan?

571
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,780
But...

572
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,140
But it can't be!

573
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,820
Zhong Hai.

574
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,260
The woman standing before you

575
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,980
is the last survivor of the Di family.

576
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,660
She is Di Ziyuan, the daughter of Marquis Jing'an.

577
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,540
The Luo family served the Di family.

578
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,140
There is only one person worthy

579
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,620
of Official Luo's unwavering loyalty.

580
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,820
Young Lady.

581
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,340
Zhong Hai.

582
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,180
I found you

583
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,620
to overturn the case from ten years ago.

584
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,420
You seek to overturn the case for your family?

585
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,100
Yes.

586
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,900
I want the world to know the truth

587
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,620
of what happened to my family ten years ago.

588
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,100
Will you help me?

589
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,180
Your wish is my command, Young Lady.

590
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,660
My life is yours to command.

591
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,660
Earlier during the morning court,

592
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,100
Qian Guangjin proposed

593
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,700
that we insert the conferring ceremony
into Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

594
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,620
What do you think?

595
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,020
Your Majesty.

596
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,260
I think

597
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,980
it's double the delight.

598
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,260
That is a sound plan.

599
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,180
Very well.

600
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,580
Let them proceed with this plan.

601
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,860
Yes.

602
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Your Majesty.

603
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,300
The Crown Prince will confer the title
of Crown Princess on your birthday banquet.

604
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,500
Her conferring ceremony

605
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,340
on my birthday banquet?

606
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,500
The Emperor wants me

607
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,260
to watch as she is married into the Han family!

608
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,740
Calm down, Your Majesty.

609
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,380
Di Cheng'en will announce
the sins of the Di family

610
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,340
during the ceremony.

611
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,660
Great.

612
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,820
Wonderful.

613
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,020
It means she's reflected for ten years.

614
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,300
I shall gauge her sincerity

615
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,060
in acknowledging her sins!

616
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,580
Bring her to me.

617
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,380
Yes.

618
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,540
Chancellor.

619
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,380
The conferring ceremony is on the same day
as the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

620
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,420
Interesting.

621
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,780
But I think

622
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,260
something is amiss,
but I can't quite put my finger on it.

623
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,980
My Lord, should we...

624
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,380
Wait and observe. Back to the residence.

625
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,140
Sir.

626
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,140
The deed is done.

627
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,580
Good.

628
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,780
Greetings, Young Lady.

629
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,380
It's been ten years. How have you been?

630
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,500
Thank you.

631
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,100
Over the years,

632
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,340
I've followed your orders.

633
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,420
Our forces cover every ground.

634
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,300
We await your summon.

635
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,580
Are we making a move, Young Lady?

636
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,340
We've found
all the former servants of the Di family

637
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,420
and gathered most of the evidence we need.

638
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,020
Now, we await the right moment.

639
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,780
Young Lady.

640
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,900
There is a special occasion this month

641
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,580
that suits your plan.

642
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,860
The Empress Dowager's birthday banquet?

643
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,820
If the ceremony happens before her birthday,

644
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,300
the Di family will still be framed.

645
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,860
Let's get it done before that.

646
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,540
I have an idea.

647
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,500
Tomorrow,

648
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,380
I shall propose this idea as a double delight

649
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,460
and celebrate both occasions.

650
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,940
Perfect.

651
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,460
During the conferring ceremony
and the birthday banquet,

652
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,420
all the officials and the imperial family
will be there.

653
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,460
That is a perfect day to clear your name.

654
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,860
I will turn the list
with all 80,000 soldiers' names

655
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,900
into a lavish gift for Her Majesty.

656
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,060
I bet this banquet

657
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,740
will be spectacular and utterly lively.

658
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,700
Is something amiss?

659
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,260
Yes.

660
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,660
