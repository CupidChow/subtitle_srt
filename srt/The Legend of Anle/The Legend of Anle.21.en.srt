[Episode 21]

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,070
[Ziyuan]

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
Official Ren, this way, please.

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,160
Oh, dear me.

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
I got absorbed in reading the letter.

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,400
After the New Year's palace banquet,

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm still recovering

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,200
and unable to get up.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,720
I hope you can understand.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,200
It's all right.

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,960
After all, you saved His Majesty.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,440
That's just as it should be.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Since the incident on New Year's Eve,

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,120
His Highness has been coming
to Yuanshui Pavilion to see me every day.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,000
Each time, he brings either some supplements

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
or various interesting things.

40
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560
This room is running out of space to store them.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,720
They are indeed
all novel and interesting things.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,720
I have never seen these things in Anle Abode.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,560
Miss Di, you are sure very lucky.

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,720
There are these letters too.

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,440
His Highness sent them
regularly to Dai Mountain.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
He had been sending them for ten years.

47
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,820
[Dear Di Ziyuan, from Han Ye]

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,080
His Highness has a kind and pure nature.

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,640
He's indeed a rare good husband in this world.

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,000
Miss Di, you should treat him sincerely.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Aren't you jealous?

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,360
When you first arrived in the capital,

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
weren't you determined
to become the Crown Princess?

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
I no longer have any feelings

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,360
for His Highness.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,200
We appeared together on Wuliu Street that day

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,720
merely to apprehend Zhong Hai.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Nothing more.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,680
Official Ren, why make excuses over something

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,600
that you can't have?

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
If you truly have no interest in His Highness,

62
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,360
why not return to Jingnan

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,160
instead of staying in the capital

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
and appearing before His Highness every day?

65
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,760
What is so funny?

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
Perhaps,

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,160
a lifetime with someone is your lifelong wish.

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
But for me,

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,320
there are other things I care about

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,320
besides love and affection.

71
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,000
Then, please remember your place

72
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,600
and don't get too close to His Highness.

73
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
I would naturally pay attention to this
if it doesn't involve court affairs.

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
But if it involves court affairs,

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm afraid I can't comply.

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,720
You...

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,440
Your Highness.

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Your Highness.

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,040
Cheng'en,

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,120
you're still weak.

81
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400
Why aren't you resting?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
Your Highness,

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,480
Official Ren and I...

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,040
Ren Anle,

85
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
don't disturb Cheng'en's rest.

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,240
Come with me.

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,320
Your...

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
Your Highness,

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,080
there are many people here.

90
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,880
I hope you'll be careful
with your words and conduct.

91
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
You're indeed cautious.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,040
The people you've trained
have excellent acting skills.

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
You even deceived me.

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,920
When have I ever deceived Your Highness?

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
I meant

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,880
the assassins and Yuanshu

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,760
put on a good act in front of Gu Qishan.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,040
After all, I am the Ren Anle,

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,440
whom you described
as both intelligent and brave.

100
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
If you're hiding something from me,

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,760
I won't be angry.

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
But I hope that one day,

103
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,760
you can tell me all the truth

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
yourself.

105
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm not hiding anything from you.

106
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,040
Besides, you already know

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
about Marquis Zhongyi.

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,840
Ren Anle,

109
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I thought of a place

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
you might like.

111
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,360
Sir,

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,520
you have the leisure

113
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,720
to tend to flowers and plants?

114
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,520
It's the Lantern Festival,

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,080
so some memories came flooding back.

116
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,840
Back then,

117
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,920
I was Ziyuan's personal bodyguard.

118
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,400
I guess it was a good time.

119
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,280
Yes, it was.

120
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
Although the capital

121
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,080
was bitterly cold that year,

122
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,840
and I couldn't see
the Flower of Longing from Jingnan,

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,960
there were still festive occasions
after the Lantern Festival.

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,960
Because of that,

125
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,640
there was no need to feel nostalgic.

126
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,160
What wish did you make?

127
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,160
It's a secret.

128
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Is it beautiful?

129
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,640
Yes, it's beautiful.

Miss, do you want to buy a lantern?

133
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
The birds look pretty too.

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,360
The lanterns are so beautiful.

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,440

Miss, buy one.

139
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,840
That lantern does look pretty.

140
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,360
All right, I'll take this one.

141
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,080
All right.

142
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,800
Your Highness, you usually follow the rules.

143
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
Why are you out having fun like this today?

144
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,360
I've been around
that audacious female pirate for too long.

145
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,960
You can say I've been influenced by her.

146
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,080
In that case, you should thank me.

147
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Thank me for allowing you

148
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,720
to live as you please once.

149
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,520
Your Highness, look!

150
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
That lantern is so beautiful.

151
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,400
Wait here.

152
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,560
Mister, come and take a look.

153
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,520
Let's go.

154
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
Wait for me! Wait up!

155
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,400
Wait for me!

156
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,520
It's yours now.

157
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,560
I didn't expect Your Highness

158
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,800
to have such an innocent and brilliant taste.

159
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
Back then, Ziyuan hated to live in the palace.

160
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
So I secretly took her out once.

161
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
During the Lantern Festival
in the capital that year,

162
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
(I splurged 10 copper coins)

163
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,720
(to win two rabbit lanterns and gifted them to her.)

164
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,840
(But the next day,)

165
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,920
I heard people in the palace say

166
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,120
that Ziyuan's birthday
was on the sixteenth day of the first month.

167
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,240
However, I was in a hurry to accompany my uncle

168
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,480
to inspect the capital region.

169
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,240
So I hastily wrote her a letter informing her

170
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,640
that I was giving her the pair of rabbit lanterns

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
as a birthday gift.

172
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,560
I wonder

173
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
if she would think I was stingy.

174
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,520
Come to think of it,

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,120
it's been ten years.

176
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,760
Your Highness has a really good memory.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,240
You even remember a trivial matter like this.

178
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,320
It's not a trivial matter.

179
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,400
The Crown Prince of Jing's marriage
with the Di family

180
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,320
was to prevent turmoil in the world.

181
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,640
Although Ziyuan and I were engaged
since childhood,

182
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
she was still young back then.

183
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
As her personal bodyguard,

184
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,280
Luo Mingxi, like a tail,

185
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,320
I received an intel

195
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,240
saying that

Marquis Zhongyi wants
to kill the New Year's Eve assassins.

197

They're meeting at Huayuan Mountain tonight.

At this point,

200

All right.

204
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,920
Di Cheng'en has agreed to our alliance

205
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,400

to help us gain the support of the Di Troops.

206
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,120

207
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,320
for your progress.

208
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,560
I've obtained intelligence
on the northwest border.

209

But

210
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
I still need some time

211
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,520
to gather the list of generals.

212
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,000
Please expedite your actions, Your Highness.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,240

General,

224
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,720
you've been in a bad mood lately.

225
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,160
So I asked Mo Shuang to come over.

226
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,440
That's a lot of weapons.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
Are these yours?

228
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
Do you know how to use them?

229
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Of course.

230
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,040
I can make all the Northwestern men obey me

231
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
because of my abilities.

232
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,400
I also want to be skilled in martial arts

233
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,320

234
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,160
That way,

235
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,000
I can protect people around me.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,880
I used to think the same as you.

237
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
But I never expected

238
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,880
that I'd been protecting the wrong people.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,920
It's all right.

240
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,440
Don't you have

241
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
Lengbei to protect you?

242
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
As a general,

243
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,520
do I need his protection?

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,440
Anning, do you read huaben too?

245
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,440
Don't touch it.

246
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry, Mo Shuang.

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,400

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,920
I was too sensitive.

Speaking of Official Ren,

296
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,920
perhaps she's bidding her time

I'm sure they'll be fine.

The terrain nearby is dangerously steep.

325
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,400
General,

326
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
excessive worry can cloud judgment.

327
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
In my opinion,

328
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,320
the chances of them surviving
are still quite high.

329
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,520
General, please take a look.

330
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,520
Although the terrain
of Huayuan Mountain is high,

331
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,960
it is densely covered with woods.

332
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
Even if they fell from the peak,

333
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,280
they'd encounter resistance
from the trees on the way down.

334
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,560
General, take a look again

335
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,480
at the spot where they fell.

336
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,840
There are rivers flowing below.

337
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,600
Now is the season of heavy rainfall and floods.

338
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
They are very likely
to have fallen into the river.

339
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,720
With their martial arts skills,

340
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,080
it's possible for them to survive

341
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,280
by swimming in the river.

342
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,560
Judging from the direction of this river

343
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,000
and the terrain on both sides,

344
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,120
they are most likely to be...

345
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,360
here.

346
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,080
I will go to the palace now

347
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,320
and request troops from His Majesty.

348
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,840
Yes.

349
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,740
Your Majesty,

350
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,980
this matter is of great importance.

351
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,260
I request Your Majesty to issue an edict

352
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,980
for me to lead the Imperial Guards

353
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,260

355
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,260
this matter cannot be made public.

356
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,620
I've already ordered people
to secretly search for them.

357
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,540
The secret search operation is slow.

Their lives are in danger.

He's the Crown Prince of Jing.

360
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,740
Once news of his serious injury
and disappearance spreads,

361
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
the people will certainly panic.

362
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,100
If this news reaches Northern Qin,

363
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,020
Anning,

364
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,340
have you thought about the consequences?

365
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,700
But that's Ye.

366
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,940
Aren't you worried about your son's life?

367
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,980
Do you think I'm not anxious or distressed?

368
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,340
He is my Crown Prince.

369
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,700
But I am the Emperor of Jing.

370
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,380
Not only am I his father,

371
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,140
but I also have to consider

372
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,020
the safety and stability of the entire Jing.

373
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Your Majesty, you are so heartless.

374
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,740
Is this what they call the relationship
between the royal family?

375
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,540
You...

376
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,500
On your knees!

377
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,260
Your Majesty,

378
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,620
Ye has never lived for himself,

379
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,660
even for a day.

380
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,660
He has followed the rules and regulations
all these years.

381
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,060
Now, his whereabouts are unknown
and his fate is uncertain.

382
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,860
But his father,

383
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,860
the Emperor of Jing, says

384
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,860
that this matter must not
be made known to the world.

385
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,540
Even if you don't order it,

386
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,540
I'll go and search for him myself.

387
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,500
To you,

388
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,260
he's only a Crown Prince.

389
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,220
But in my heart,

390
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,940
he's my older brother.

391
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,100
He was born

392
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,380
to be the Crown Prince.

393
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,580
This is his destiny.

394
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,020
Hurry up.

395
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,540
Your Majesty.

396
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,860
Your Majesty,

397
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,860
let me go and summon the imperial physician.

398
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,340
No need.

399
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,380
Your Majesty,

400
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,620
the Crown Prince is blessed by Heaven.

401
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,860
He will definitely be all right.

402
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,900
Please don't be too anxious.

403
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,100
Your Majesty,

404
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,380
the Empress Dowager is bedridden

405
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,020
because she's too worried about the Crown Prince.

406
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,580
Your Majesty,

407
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,180
you must take care of yourself.

408
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,220
I'm all right.

409
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,900
Is Marquis Zhongyi

410
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,860
still refusing to say anything?

411
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,220
Official Luo has interrogated him
for a long time.

413
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,020
But he has not obtained any useful information.

414
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,900
This is really beyond my expectations.

415
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,420
I didn't expect him to be so stubborn.

416
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,270
[Prison]

417
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,780
Official Luo, you've been torturing me
without asking any questions.

418
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,300
If this matter gets out,

419
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,060
what would His Majesty think?

420
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,540
No one is interested in what you have to say.

421
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,540
So why should I question you?

422
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,540
Without my testimony,

423
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,300
how can you convict me of my crime?

424
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,020
Is this how the Ministry of Justice

425
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,500
has been handling cases all this while?

426
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
That's funny.

427
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,180
Don't you know

428
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,620
how the Ministry of Justice handles cases?

429
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,140
Take a look at this.

430
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,020
These are the accusations
from Gu Qishan against you.

431
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,660
Wait...

432
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,380
How did he fall into Ren Anle...

433
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,580
I really planned everything carefully.

434
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,020
Gu Qishan, this unfilial son.

435
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,540
He's disloyal,

436
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,020
unrighteous,

437
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,580
vicious, and unfilial.

438
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,540
Luo Mingxi,

439
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,780
how can you trust the words

440
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,860
of a rebellious son?

441
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,100
Disloyal, unfilial, vicious, and unrighteous.

442
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,700
Like father, like son.

443
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,700
He's indeed your son.

444
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,500
It's only natural

445
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,860
that he sent his father to his death.

446
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,500
My lifelong reputation

447
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,940
is ruined by my own son.

448
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,100
This is all retribution.

449
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,780
What exactly do you want?

450
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,340
I want you to tell me

451
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,620
who pushed Ren Anle down the cliff.

452
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,580
I know nothing about that incident.

453
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,340
Didn't you arrange the plot

454
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,620
at Huayuan Mountain?

455
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,780
I'm already a prisoner under your control.

456
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,260
Why would I still hide anything from you?

457
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,660
Isn't the Western Outpost under your control?

458
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,140
The Western Outpost?

459
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,780
When you're determined to find fault with me,

460
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,620
you can always come up with reasons.

461
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,900
I can admit all the crimes I've committed.

462
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,020
But

463
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,820
I won't admit anything

464
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,580
related to the Western Outpost.

465
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,340
Luo Mingxi,

466
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,580
you can't blame me for anything

467
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,020
that's done by the Western Outpost.

468
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,340
I am innocent.

469
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,460
I was framed.

470
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,140
[Prison]

471
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,020
(It seems that there is more)

472
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,220
(to the Western Outpost.)

473
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
(Who is the mastermind behind it all?)

474
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,140
(Anle,)

475
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,020
(where are you now?)

476
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,340
(Please be safe.)

477
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,580
Han Ye.

478
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,220
Han Ye?

479
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,420
Han Ye.

480
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,340
Open your eyes, Han Ye.

481
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,660
Han Ye.

482
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,620
You can't sleep.

483
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,940
Wake up now.

484
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,940
Ren Anle...

485
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,660
Yes,

486
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,860
I'm right here.

487
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,820
Hang in there.

488
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,100
You can't sleep.

489
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,820
I...

490
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,660
Hang in there.

491
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,180
I'm only...

492
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm only a little tired.

493
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,660
I caught a bird to use as a marker.

494
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
Hold on a little longer.

495
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,740
They will come to rescue us soon.

496
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,380
Don't fall asleep.

497
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,100
As the Crown Prince of Jing,

498
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,660
are you going to let yourself die here?

499
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,300
You must not fall asleep.

500
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,620
It's pretty nice

501
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,300
to die here.

502
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,380
Stop talking nonsense.

503
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,340
If you die here,

504
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
I'll never forgive you.

505
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,340
Look at my current state,

506
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,900
I don't think I need your forgiveness.

507
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,180
If you die here,

508
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,100
what about the navy I gave you?

509
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,740
I accompanied you to Jiangnan
and we went through thick and thin together.

510
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,580
I didn't do all these things to die with you.

511
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,620
Please don't fall asleep.

512
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,580
If you die,

513
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,940
how am I supposed to pay back what I owe you?

514
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,300
Wake up now.

515
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,860
You can't die.

516
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,260
Ren Anle...

517
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,900
Wen Shuo...

518
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,300
Don't talk about Wen Shuo.

519
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,660
What does a kid like him know?

520
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,300
Don't sleep.

521
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,060
You must not close your eyes.

522
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,860
I haven't repaid you
for saving me at Wuliu Street.

523
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,940
I don't need you to repay me.

524
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,660
I...

525
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,020
Han Ye...

526
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,340
Han Ye.

527
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,860
Han Ye,

528
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,460
open your eyes.

529
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,860
Han Ye, wake up.

530
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,580
Anyone...

531
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,580
Is there anyone here?

532
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,660
Cave... A cave.

533
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,620
I saw a cave.

534
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,980
Han Ye, we won't freeze to death now.

535
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,140
Open your eyes.

536
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,620
Wake up now.

537
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
I... I won't let you die.

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,660
Why are you still unconscious?

566
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,740
I must have owed you in my past life

567
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,820
to encounter you in this life.

568
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,260
Why did you take a stab on my behalf

569
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,700
for no reason?

570
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,420
Do you think being a Crown Prince

571
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,540
means you are invincible?

572
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,820
You're about to get married

573
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,620
and Di Ziyuan has been waiting for you
for ten years.

574
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,860
Do you want all her effort to go to waste?

575
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,340
I just

576
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,180
don't want you to die.

577
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,660
You're awake.

578
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,500
Han Ye.

579
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,860
Seeing you

580
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,340
safe and sound

581
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,980
puts my heart at ease.

582
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Are you a fool?

583
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,140
I am the chief of Anle Abode.

584
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,780
I don't need you to save me.

585
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,820
Since young,

586
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,620
I've never been this willful before.

587
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,580
But I'm really happy

588
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,500
that my willfulness

589
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,820
protected you.

590
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,780
You may be happy about it. But not me.

591
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,180
Do you know you almost died?

592
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,660
I'll be fine.

593
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,820
Don't worry.

594
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,660
Han Ye.

595
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:35,980
Han Ye!

596
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,940
It's a cold.

597
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,940
Han Ye.

598
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,300
Han Ye!

599
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,420
I won't let you die.

600
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,260
You're awake.

601
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,140
That was close.

602
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,220
You won't die for now.

603
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,700
Did you stay by my side all this time?

604
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,900
What else can I do?

605
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,420
You don't get better and I can't leave.

606
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,140
Have you been staying awake

607
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,980
because you've been watching me?

608
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,180
Anle.

609
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:52,980
Anle.

610
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,100
Anle.

611
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,060
Why are you so weak?

612
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,180
Ziyuan.

613
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,100
Ziyuan,

614
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,460
are you all right?

615
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,220
When Official Ren was fighting the pirates

616
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,140
at Anle Abode,

617
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,340
she was unfortunately stabbed by a long saber.

618
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,540
(I can't believe he used
such an excuse to cover for you.)

619
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,220
(How can I not recognize)

620
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,180
(this scar on your shoulder?)

621
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,820
Ziyuan,

622
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,140
it's really you.

623
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,180
From our first meeting in Jingnan,

624
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,420
it felt like we had met before.

625
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,620
Is this Heaven's mercy

626
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,820
or is fate playing tricks?

627
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,860
No matter what happens,

628
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,340
Ziyuan,

629
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,380
I vowed to protect you

630
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,540
ten years ago.

631
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,980
A promise is as firm as a mountain

632
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,020
and will never change.

00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,620
have you received any news of His Highness?

00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,820
I'm going to find them myself.

637
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,180
Let's go back.

638
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,460
Now there is no news from the Crown Prince,

639
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,020
and I may never become the Crown Princess.

640
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,260
Are you satisfied now?

641
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,540
Do you care about Highness's safety

642
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,180
or your own prosperity?

643
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,900

Report.

667
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,300
Within the radius of twenty li to the northwest,

668
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,060
they're nowhere to be seen.

669
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,820
Report!

672
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,020
they're nowhere to be seen too.

00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,580

00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,140
You haven't slept for days.

Why don't you get some rest?

678
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,180
I'll keep watch.

679
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,620
How can I rest

680
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,420

687
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,820
Have you found them?

688
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,540
No.

689
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,100
What about you?

690
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,220
Same here.

691
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,940
This area is full of thorns,

692
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,500
and there's no trace of any living person.

693
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,540
They might have been trapped somewhere.

694
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,100
Or maybe...

695
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,820
No, they won't die.

696
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,540
They won't.

697
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,500
I don't want to believe that either.

698
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,500
But even if they're still alive now,

699
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
there are dangers everywhere

700
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,700
in these mountains and forests.

701
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,780
The longer it takes to find them,

702
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,300
the less hope we have.

703
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,980
That won't happen.

704
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,300
No!

705
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,620
I'll go and find them now!

706
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:56,940

You're alive and well too.

713
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,980
I guess my hard work paid off.

714
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,020

Besides,

717
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,980
didn't I get

718
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,660
to be in your embrace?

719
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,860
It's considered a windfall for me.

720
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,940
Why did you take off your clothes
and give them to me?

721
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,980
You are delicate and tender.

722
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,100
If you catch a cold,

723
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,740
I will have to nurse you for a few more days.

724
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,380
I have almost recovered now.

725
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,660
Of course,

726
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,700
you are the Crown Prince of the imperial family.

727

Even the King of Hell
wouldn't dare to take you away.

728

What's there to be afraid of?

729
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,700
I have you to support me.

730
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,780
I'm not your only support.

731
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,220

732

be worth anything?
