00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,380
there is no one

376
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,700
who can pose a threat to me

377
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,580
in the capital yet.

378
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,620
So don't worry.

379
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,620
Your Highness.

380
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,540
You always pay attention to the wrong thing.

381
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,700
You did it before, and you do it now.

382
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,670
[Western Outpost]

383
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,250
[Longxiang Army Headcount]

384
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,620
I found the name list.

385
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,220
You did?

386
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,540
What is this?

387
00:23:59,620 --> 00:23:59,980
Give it to me.

388
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,980
Didn't I give this to you?

389
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
You've been carrying it with you?

390
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,900
You loved to retract your weiqi move.

391
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,780
I used to hate it

392
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,340
because for me, that was being frivolous.

393
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,900
But recently, I have come to think

394
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,220
that we can replay a game of weiqi,

395
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,460
but not our life.

396
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,620
Therefore, if we make a mistake,

397
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,780
perhaps we should give ourselves
a chance to make amends.

398
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,900
You're sorely mistaken, Your Highness.

399
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,900
I always play weiqi with Official Ren

400
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,380
and she thinks twice before she makes

401
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,540
a move.

402
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,900
That's right, Your Highness.

403
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,140
Your memory fails you.

404
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,460
I have never retracted any move.

405
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,540
I guess so.

406
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
Now, show me the name list.

407
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,620
Ren Anle.

408
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,980
If you ever find yourself in a pickle again,

409
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,380
come to me.

410
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,460
Don't shoulder the risk alone.

411
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,060
Your Highness,

412
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,980
you should let go

413
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,540
of your regrets.

414
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,700
You don't need that burden.

415
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,580
No one

416
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,380
was absent during the night

417
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,220
of the banquet.

418
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,860
And no one has sustained a new injury.

419
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,340
I'm afraid the assassin isn't from this outpost.

420
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,900
It seems like

421
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,620
we have hit another wall.

422
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,620
Marquis Zhongyi can get away with it.

423
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,340
It's okay.

424
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
We can always find

425
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,300
another eyewitness.

426
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,540
We can drag Marquis Zhongyi down
one way or another.

427
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,460
Mercy!

428
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,300
My father is Marquis Zhongyi.

429
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,180
Don't kill me.

430
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,060
My father

431
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,300
will pay you anything.

432
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,900
I want your life.

433
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,060
Thank you, my savior.

435
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,660
How do you know?

436
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,300
You said it just now.

437
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,420
Who sent you here? Speak.

438

440
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,140
You work for my father?

441
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,620
Sorry, Young Master.

442
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,340
The Marquis sent me here

443
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,820
to kill you.

444
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,220
Your father wants to kill you?

445
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,380
Impossible.

446
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,460
This can't be it.

447
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,540
Why would my father kill me?

448
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,300
He sent me out of the capital

449
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,620
so that I can live.

450
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,980
With those lousy bodyguards

451

452
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,220
A father wants his son dead.

453
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,700
That's rough.

454
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,620
But put yourself in your father's shoes.

455
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,620
Sacrificing you is worth it

456
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,380
to keep his forces alive.

457
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,140
He made a tough decision.

458
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,140
Don't be that crestfallen.

459
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,220
Perhaps,

460
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,340
my young lady can help you.

461
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,140
Your Majesty.

462
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,900
You see this?

463
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,580
I only gave Marquis Zhongyi the cold shoulder
for a few days,

464
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,620
and the others are treating him like a plague.

465
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,420
What a bunch of bandwagoners.

466
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,460
Calm down, Your Majesty.

467
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,380
These officials

468
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,380
want to earn your favor.

469
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
If everyone

470
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,900
only practices opportunism,

471
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,060
peace will be broken soon.

472
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,860
However,

473
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,300
I did glean something useful
from these memorials.

474
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,780
Your Majesty,

475
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,500
Gu Qishan is detained by Official Ren.

476
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,900
He pleaded guilty to everything.

477
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,540
So he took the blame

478
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,900
for his father.

479
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,300
What a filial son.

Gu Qishan

482
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,540
betrayed his father and told us every crime

486
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,900
Did something happen to Qishan?

487
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,220
It's been a while

488
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,580
and we haven't heard from him.

489
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,660
Don't worry, my dear.

490
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,860
My men are escorting him. He'll be safe.

491
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,700
The priority now is to see His Majesty

492
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,220
and clarify everything.

493
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,860
We will then

494
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,340
still have a chance.

495
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,420
We can't

496
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,740
just rely on
the Grand Chancellor of the Left solely.

497
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,420
Be patient, my dear. Let's wait.

498
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,340
Let's wait.

499
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,380
Here, have some tea.

[To Marquis Zhongyi, Gu Yunnian. Ren Anle
wanted to capture Qishan. I saved him.]

502
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,900
Ren Anle sent someone to capture Qishan

503
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,380
to coerce him into testifying against me.

504
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
The Grand Chancellor of the Left
found out in time

505
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,360
and saved Qishan.

506
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,080
What?

507
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,300
He told me to meet him
on Huayuan Mountain tonight

508
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,060
to fetch Qishan.

509
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,940
Li You.

510
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,620
Yes, My Lord?

Prepare the horse carriage.

I have done everything

you told me to.

517
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,860
Marquis Zhongyi is no longer influential.

518
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,500
It's time to put him to rest.

519
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,140
May he rest in peace.

[Yuchen Hall]

521
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,380
Are you here

522
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,700
to talk about Gu Yunnian?

523
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,180
Your Majesty.

524
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,380
Gu Qishan confessed everything.

525

The cheating chase,
the Jiangnan corruption case.

526
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,940
Marquis Zhongyi is the mastermind.

527
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,380
He even manipulated
the Crown Princess selection process

528
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,660
so that the nation would lose its peace.

529
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:38,900
Your Majesty.

530
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,220
The Zhong's case this year

531
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,900
was committed by Gu Qishan.

532
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,140
To save his son, Marquis Zhongyi

533
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,380
set a fire at Wuliu Street,

534
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,900
killing innocent lives in its wake.

535
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,380
Any one of them

536
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,020
is an egregious crime.

537
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,780
Marquis Zhongyi might have made some mistakes,

538
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,340
but he is a loyal minister.

539
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,460
Besides,

540
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,140
Zhong Hai's case is still

541
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,620
pending investigation.

542
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,980
I cannot jump to conclusions hastily

543
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,140
and convince others to do the same.

544
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,060
Your Majesty.

545
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,780
This is the sword used by the assassin
during the banquet.

546
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,380
Western Outpost?

547
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:33,900
That's right.

548
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm sure you know

549
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,780
that the Western Outpost answers

550
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,820
directly to Marquis Zhongyi.

551
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,380
Although I haven't identified the assassin,

552
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,260
all evidence

553
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,900
points toward Marquis Zhongyi.

554
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,540
For years,

555
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,140
I thought

556
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,260
Gu Yunnian was just a man with a giant ego.

557
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,780
But

558
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,380
in the end,

559
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,300
he let me down.

560
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,500

561
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
I will

562
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,180
put you in charge of this case.
