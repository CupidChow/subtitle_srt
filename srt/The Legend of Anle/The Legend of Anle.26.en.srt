00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,060
Let's drink to our heart's content tonight.

189
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,420
-To our heart's content.
-To our heart's content.

190
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,380
To our heart's content.

191
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,920
[Fuling Mountain]

192
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,300
Sun Yujun,

193
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,740
I am a person who knows what is right and wrong

194
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,500
[Di Shengtian, former head of the Di family]
and one who seeks vengeance.

195
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,940
Your hands are stained
with the blood of my family.

196
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,740
Take another step forward,

197
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,700
and I will strike you down where you stand.

198
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,020
When it happened back then,

199
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,220
you chose to seclude yourself.

200
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,380
Everyone thought you were dead.

201
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,420
Now that people are dead and buried,

202
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,260
you've come to settle the score with me.

203
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,060
Don't you think it's a bit too late?

204
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,460
Back then,

205
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I made a promise to Han Zi'an.

206
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,660
I promised him

207
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,380
I would never set foot in the capital again.

208
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,860
I promised him.

209
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,620
I had to keep my word.

210
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,180
Promise?

211
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,540
You dare speak of that word?

212
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,660
When have you ever kept your promise?

213
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,180
You promised me

214
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,260
you would leave the late Emperor!

215
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
But in the end,

216
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,700
you still joined him!

217
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,620
The Hall of Supreme Harmony

218
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,940
was where you two discussed politics.

219
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,540
The imperial study

220
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,260
was where you reviewed memorials with him.

221
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,620
In the end,

222
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
the two of you even moved

223
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
into the Plum Blossom Abode

224
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,180
with my son!

225
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,740
There was only one place for me

226
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,540
in the entire Jing State,

227
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,180
the Jingxin Hall he never set foot in.

228
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
Is this what you call honoring your promise?

229
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,300
All because of this,

230
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,940
you ruined the Di family,

231
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,380
killed 80,000 Jing people,

232
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,420
and ended up creating a blood feud
between the Han and Di families?

233
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
How could you do this

234
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,780
to Han Zi'an?

235
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,580
Why not?

236
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,660
I gave him everything,

237
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,900
and what about him?

238
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,980
What did he do for me?

239
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,740
Han Zi'an devoted his life

240
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,220
to you

241
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,340
and your son.

242
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,620
He left you a peaceful and stable Jing State.

243
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,540
Han Zi'an knew he was going to die

244
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,860
the second year after the founding of Jing State.

245
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,460
At that time,

246
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,740
I was prepared to return to Jingnan.

247
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,060
I went to bid farewell,

248
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,540
but I found him fainted

249
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,980
in the imperial study.

250
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,060
That's when I realized

251
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,860
he only had three months to live.

252
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,200
It was in the early days
of the founding of Jing State.

253
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,420
Northern Qin and Dongqian were watching warily.

254
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,660
He could not die.

255
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,380
I had to stay.

256
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,180
I did everything I could

257
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,340
to protect his heart

258
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,980
and extend his life for three more years.

259
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,060
Impossible…

260
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,340
You're lying!

261
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,900
I have no reason to lie to you.

262
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,180
Why didn't he ever tell me?

263
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
I am his wife!

264
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,740
Why wouldn't he tell me anything?

265
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,660
If he couldn't deceive you,

266
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,020
how could he deceive the other lords and vassals,

267
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,020
assassins, and spies of the other states?

268
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,460
Di Shengtian…

269
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,020
Han Zi'an…

270
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
Do both of you

271
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,580
take me for a fool?

272
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,300
We didn't tell you because…

273
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,620
There was no need

274
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,660
to hide it from me!

275
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,540
I am his wife!

276
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,780
Why couldn't you two have told me?

277
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,300
Would I have stopped you from saving him

278
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,740
or announced this to the world

279
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,660
and let chaos befall the Jing State?

280
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,900
The two of you

281
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,660
were always so high and mighty

282
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,540
that you see everyone else as fools.

283
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,060
You always claimed

284
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,460
that you and he were only bosom friends

285
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,180
who shared mutual appreciation
and understanding of each other.

286
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,180
But who in this world

287
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,420
would find that believable?

288
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,060
Let them think what they want.

289
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,580
I have a clear conscience.

290
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,940
You're so full of yourself.

291
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
It makes me sick.

292
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,060
I don't want anything more to do

293
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,340
with you and Han Zi'an.

294
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Even now,

295
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,540
your appearance remains the same.

296
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,660
In a hundred years,

297
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,940
I'm sure the two of you can rekindle your love.

298
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,180
Unlike your otherworldly appearance, however,

299
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,060
you care nothing of your descendants.

300
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,260
I

301
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,540
falsified an imperial edict

302
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,180
and killed 80,000 soldiers.

303
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,900
I'll take the blame myself.

304
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,060
Even so,

305
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,420
I have no regrets.

306
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,940
How could you? Even now, you…

307
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,300
If you're so intelligent,

308
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,100
how could you not understand

309
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,060
that an emperor cannot tolerate another

310
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,660
encroaching upon his authority?

311
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,740
If I actually cared

312
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
about that position,

313
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,700
why would I give away half of my kingdom?

314
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,580
Sun Yujun,

315
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,940
have you not realized this by now?

316
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,180
You've been conceited all your life.

317
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,780
You pride yourself on your wit and heroism.

318
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,540
But you must know that so long
as the Di family held that much power,

319
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,100
there will come a day
when the empire shall be divided.

320
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,340
That is not something you alone can decide.

321
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,580
For my son,

322
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,580
for the Jing State,

323
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,100
for the peace of the world,

324
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,460
I regret nothing.

325
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,550
[Crown Prince's Residence]

326
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,820
Your Highness,

327
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
it's time to rest.

328
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,540
Your Highness,

329
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,580
there are things that are beyond your control.

330
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,940
Official Ren, too…

331
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,660
She is now Di Ziyuan.

332
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,580
Yes.

333
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,940
Official…

334
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,820
Official Di as well.

335
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,940
After all, you two had a bond.

336
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,500
How could she choose to do that on that day?

337
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,740
It was the Han family that wronged the Di family.

338
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,060
There is no need for her

339
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,820
to consider me when she took action.

340
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,780
After today,

341
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,700
we don't owe each other anything.

342
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,180
But this will also be

343
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,580
the end of our affections.

344
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,180
Wen Shuo.

345
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,180
This matter had nothing to do with you

346
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,180
and even less to do with your friendship with her.

347
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,540
You've found a kindred spirit in her,

348
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,580
and she sees you as her younger brother.

349
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,220
You two should stay in contact.

350
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,980
She will be happy

351
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,300
to see you.

352
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,370
[Residence of the Princess]

353
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,700
(It's a good chance to get her
to let her guard down.)

354
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,340
You upheld justice

355
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,060
for the greater good

356
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,940
before the court.

357
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,820
I've never seen a princess

358
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,300
as brave as you.

359
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,820
No.

360
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,820
I'm merely atoning for my cowardice

361
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,420
ten years ago.

362
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,420
But I…

363
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,940
But I've let Grandmother down even more…

364
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,300
She was so good to me

365
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
when I was a child…

366
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,300
As far as the Empress Dowager is concerned,

367
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,580
she needs not to hide anything
from anyone anymore.

368
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,940
It is salvation for her as well.

369
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,220
General,

370
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,780
you've been overexerting yourself lately.

371
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,460
Why not leave your duties

372
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,060
to me?

373
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,060
Sir,

374
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,940
you shouldn't drink too much.

375
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,980
The weather is cold,
but the liquor is strong and heaty.

376
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,300
Your body cannot handle

377
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,900
the sudden change in temperature.

378
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,460
It has been ten years.

379
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,140
For ten years,

380
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,180
I've devoted painstaking effort to this.

381
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,980
Ten years of lying in wait.

382
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,060
I've finally returned justice to the Di family.

383
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,700
Linlang,

384
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,380
do you know?

385
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,580
I haven't been this happy in ten years.

386
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,220
It's windy out here. We should go inside.

387
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
I'm fine.

388
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,460
After ten years,

389
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,060
I can finally call her Ziyuan

390
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,060
now.

391
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
I brought back

392
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,060
the most spirited and unbridled young woman

393
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,380
in the capital with my own hands.

394
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,700
Miss Di has returned,

395
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,260
but what about you?

396
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,060
You've always had a weak constitution.

397
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,380
If you don't take care of yourself,

398
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,060
you won't live long.

399
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,460
But in the past ten years,

400
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,180
you've never given yourself a moment's respite

401
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,540
in order to help Miss Di.

402
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,820
So what if I end up dying?

403
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,060
I live

404
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,300
for her.

405
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,340
Di Ziyuan,

406
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
is this your home?

407
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,020
Ten years…

408
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,940
No matter how hard I tried to be you,

409
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,180
I was never able to become you.

410
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,820
If all of this was never meant to be mine,

411
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,540
why let me have that false hope
that it could have been?

412
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,820
Let's go home.

413
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:51,940
Look.

414
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,460
You're all drenched.

415
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,940
We should go back.

416
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,700
Go away!

417
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,940
I'm not Di Ziyuan!

418
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
Stay away from me!

419
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,100
You said it was me

420
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
you needed to come with you.

421
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,060
When we first entered the capital,

422
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,540
I told you this was a dangerous place,
and we should not stay long.

423
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,460
But you said

424
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,180
we…

425
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,220
We were meant to stay here

426
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,820
forever and ever.

427
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,300
I want to stay by your side forever.

428
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,580
I said

429
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,420
I would give my life for the rest of yours.

430
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,340
I'm still alive,

431
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,260
and you still have
the rest of your life ahead of you.

432
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,420
I am not going anywhere.

433
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,940
I'm no longer Di Ziyuan.

434
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,580
I'm just a beggar.

435
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,220
I have nothing now.

436
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,780
You still have me.

437
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,900
You're not a beggar.

438
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,060
Nor are you Di Ziyuan.

439
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,060
You

440
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,100
are the one that I want
to protect for the rest of my life.

441
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,140
Look.

442
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
I've been carrying the tassel you gave me.

443
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,580
You said

444
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,780
your feelings for me when you made this tassel

445
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,620
were sincere.

446
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,460
I remember all of it.

447
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,580
I was lying to you.

448
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,900
Be it lies or truths,

449
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,580
I believe every word

450
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,820
you say.

451
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,620
(Your Majesty,)

452
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,500
(you must be long tired)

453
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,300
(of my offerings of candles and incense.)

454
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,980
(Yes.)

455
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,020
(You had great ambitions.)

456
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,940
(That was what made me)

457
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,340
(willingly waste my youth and prime on you.)

458
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,980
(This bow I give to you)

459
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,100
(to thank you for retaining
my empty title and honor.)

460
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,900
(But you forgot)

461
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,700
(that the Sun family was one
with a legacy of hundred years old.)

462
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,460
(I, Sun Yujun,)

463
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,220
(was never lesser than anyone.)

464
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,100
(You were only too blind to see it.)

465
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,320
[Ren's Residence]

466
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,100
What's on your mind, Young Lady?

467
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,220
How many days has it been?

468
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,700
Tomorrow will be the third day

469
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,100
since His Majesty gave us his word.

470
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,820
The answer you've waited ten years for
is finally coming.

471
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,740
His Majesty wouldn't fool us, right?

472
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,870
[Residence of the Princess]

473
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,770
[Crown Prince's Residence]

474
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,860
48.

475
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,340
49.

476
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,620
How many times was the bell sounded?

477
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,820
60.

478
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,620
The Empress Dowager
has just celebrated her 60th birthday.

479
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,620
Young Lady,

480
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,820
could it be…

481
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,820
The Empress Dowager is dead.

482
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,020
Her Majesty…

483
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,120
[To His Majesty]

484
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,300
(The wrongful conviction of the Di family)

485
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,820
(has been overturned.)

486
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,620
(But you remain the Emperor of Jing,)

487
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,980
(Han Zhongyuan.)

488
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,260
(It was the Di family that lost.)

489
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,860
(Di Shengtian lost.)

490
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,300
(Di Ziyuan lost.)

491
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,060
(You won.)

492
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,500
(I won.)

493
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,660
(Di Shengtian)

494
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,740
(thought)

495
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,860
(that it was the late Emperor
that clung to my every thought.)

496
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,340
(She thought I destroyed the Di family
because of him as well.)

497
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,380
(None of that is true.)

498
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,300
(I did it for you,)

499
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,460
(my only son.)

500
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,580
(I wanted you to be a benevolent and wise ruler)

501
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,700
(respected by all.)

502
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,380
(I will take responsibility)

503
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,820
(for what I have done.)

504
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,180
(I will not make things difficult for you.)

505
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,060
(The Han family and the Di family)

506
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,060
(may have formed the Jing State together,)

507
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,340
(but it is the Han family that rules it.)

508
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,460
(We owe nothing)

509
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,100
(to the people of Jing.)

510
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,420
(I shall leave you now.)

511
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,060
(Do not worry about me.)

512
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,340
I will follow

513
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,020
your teachings, Mother.

514
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,260
Your Highness.

515
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,620
What's the status of the Di family

516
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,580
at the Northwest borders?

517
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,300
They're being gathered.

518
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,220
However,

519
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,700
Di Cheng'en's identity has been exposed.

520
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,460
We cannot use her any longer.

521
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,380
But the news

522
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,300
won't reach the border for a while.

523
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,860
We should take this opportunity

524
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,780
to use the former servants of the Di family

525
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,860
to take over those cities.

526
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,020
This is the latest information
from the Northwest.

527
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,060
It records the latest defense layout

528
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,740
and personnel movements of Qingnan City.

529
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,780
It seems that Your Highness

530
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,540
has Princess Anning wrapped around your finger.

531
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,580
Your Highness,

532
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,300
we've received another letter from Northern Qin.

533
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,780
If we have obtained
most of the information regarding the Northwest,

534
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,340
we should dispose of Princess Anning soon

535
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,620
to prevent any undesirables.

536
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,140
No need to kill her.

537
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,700
I mean, from the looks of things,

538
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,420
she's worth more alive.

539
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,380
After all, she's still in charge of the army.

540
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,820
Furthermore,

541
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,380
she has been stationed in Qingnan for years.

542
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,820
She has a reputation.

543
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,420
Tell them not to fret.

544
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,460
Everything is under my control.

545
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,300
I will use her to capture Qingnan City.

546
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,620
Your Highness has kept a vigil
in the main hall for three days.

547
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
You haven't eaten or drunk anything,

548
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,300
and you haven't rested your eyes.

549
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,300
Your body must be exhausted.

550
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,500
It is my duty as the Crown Prince

551
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,260
to fulfill my filial duty to Grandmother.

552
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,180
Your Highness,

553
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,340
I recently learned a few new dishes.

554
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,620
Red bean porridge,

555
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,820
Gong Bao Hare,

556
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,020
and stir-fried fish fillet with vinegar.

557
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,380
For the red bean…

558
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,100
