28
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,660
Did the Crown Prince send you to check in on her?

No one would dare mention her name

to our reunion in the capital,

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,500
you were plotting whenever you approached me.

I knew you had ulterior motives,

54

could you be honest with me for once?

Is there anything

63
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,660
that you must do regardless of the price?

If it weren't his intention,

81
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,300
why wouldn't he give the Di family a chance

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,620
Nothing grows there.

190
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,660
Even the cattle died of starvation.

191
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,220
To survive, the people of Northern Qin

192
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,660
must rob the southern strongholds.

193
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,620
These cases have brought fear

194
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,900
to the people of Jing.

195
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,780
Our defense at the Northwestern border
has loosened.

196
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,260
I fear the Northern Qin's military

197
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,020
might seize the chance to stir up trouble.

198
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,660
Are you reinforcing the security?

199
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,660
Correct.

200
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,340
The border garrisons

201
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,620
are meant to defend the borders.

202
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,700
There are openings and flaws
in the Northwestern border defense.

203
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,540
It's hard to keep the two strongholds,

204
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,100
Qingnan and Junxian, safe from enemies.

205
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm going inside to write up a letter.

206
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Send it to the Northwest afterward.

207
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,340
Yes.

208
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
What will you do against their plan to approach

209
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,620
the Di family's old servants in the Northwest?

210
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,180
Di Ziyuan was supposed to be

211
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,460
the acquiescent Di Cheng'en.

212
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,740
But now, she's the unyielding Ren Anle.

213
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
Things are much more complicated now.

214
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,620
The Empress Dowager passed away.

215
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,340
Her death shook the court.

216
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,580
Now is the time to act.

217
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,700
Once the garrisons in Northwest are reinforced,

218
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,860
all of our plans will go down the drain.

219
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
If you get in the way of my plan,

220
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,860
not even death can absolve your mistake.

221
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,340
Your Highness.

222
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,220
As I said, always be patient.

223
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,620
The right timing has yet to come.

224
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,980
Han Zhongyuan

225
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,900
has been sitting on the throne for ten years.

226
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,700
The Di family's tragedy won't be enough

227
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,380
to dethrone him.

228
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,740
We must let the flame

229
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,620
burn even brighter.

230
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,380
Your top priority

231
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
is to help me take control of the Northwest,

232
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,380
not to stir up trouble in the court.

233
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,860
In that case,

234
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
why not mobilize the troops?

235
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,300
Take Anning hostage to control the troops.

236
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,980
Then, you can finish her off.

237
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,620
The Northwest will be devoid of a leader.

238
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,740
It will be ours to take.

239
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,340
If she is unwilling,

240
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,700
this is too big a risk!

241
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,580
Since we can't kill Anning

242
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,100
or approach the Di family's former servants,

243
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
bringing chaos to the imperial court of Jing

244
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,220
is our top priority.

245
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,380
We can spare Anning.

246
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,940
But there is someone that must die.

247
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,980
You want to kill Ren Anle?

248
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,740
She is the sole survivor of the Di family.

249
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,220
She is cunning.

250
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,460
If we can't make her work for us,

251
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,700
we must get rid of her before it's too late.

252
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,580
We'll use Han Zhongyuan

253
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,740
to eliminate her.

254
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,060
That should incite people's dissatisfaction

255
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,580
and cut off a loose end for us.

256
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,620
She gave Han Zhongyuan a slap in the face

257
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,300
in front of every official in the imperial court

258
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
and caused the Empress Dowager's death.

259
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,100
Even though the case
from ten years ago was overturned,

260
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,340
it doesn't change the fact that the person
on Dai Mountain

261
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,220
wasn't Ren Anle.

262
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,220
That alone constitutes
the crime of deceiving the Emperor.

263
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,060
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]
Fabrics! Have a look at the fabrics!

264
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,940
Homemade chairs!

265
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,700
Miss Di was born in a rural area,

266
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,820
but she doesn't bow down to evil
and stands righteously.

267
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,500
As for the Han family,

268
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940
the Crown Prince has a great reputation outside,

269
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,180
but that doesn't hide
the imperial family's dirty secrets.

270
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,300
Despite her young age, Miss Di is already

271
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,940
known by everyone.

272
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,940
The way I see it, she is just as capable

273
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,220
as the legendary Di Shengtian.

274
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,460
The Jing State will soon have
a second Di Shengtian.

275
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,580
Yet another legend.

276
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,700
His Majesty is filial to the Empress Dowager.

277
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,300
Had she not taken her own life,

278
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,180
who knows how this situation can be resolved.

279
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,300
After committing such a heinous crime,

280
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,820
she can't even give a sound explanation.

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,460
As you wish,

282
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,700
Miss Di has earned the hearts of the people.

283
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,660
What else are you worried about?

284
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,700
When did these radical scholars

285
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,100
start gathering here?

286
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,180
I've never seen these people before.

287
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,340
They showed up
the day after the Empress Dowager's

288
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,540
passing.

289
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,060
Cursed Di Ziyuan.

290
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,580
Curse the second legend!

291
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,140
Sorry, Your Majesty.

292
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,060
It's only a bunch
of baseless gossip from the people.

293
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,260
Do not take them seriously.

294
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,460
Your Majesty.

295
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,700
You have nothing to worry about.

296
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,940
The Crown Prince has taken over
the morning court session.

297
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,340
Everything has been settled accordingly.

298
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,460
Accordingly?

299
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,260
I miscalculated.

300
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,860
For the past ten years,

301
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,700
I've so wishfully thought
there wouldn't be any threat.

302
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,180
Your Majesty.

303
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,820
For the past ten years,
the Jing State has had peace and prosperity

304
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,300
under your rule.

305
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,580
It's only a few baseless rumors.

306
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,340
Nothing in this land can threaten your place

307
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,300
as the Emperor.

308
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
Wrong.

309
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,340
There is someone capable of that.

310
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,300
For the past decade,

311
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,980
she's had me ensnared.

312
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,620
I couldn't act unless she did it first.

313
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,180
You mean her?

314
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,300
Even when the Di family was wiped out,

315
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,740
she had never been to the capital.

316
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,500
Perhaps

317
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,500
she is already dead.

318
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,500
She won't die so easily!

319
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,780
She won't show up,

320
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,660
but her grandniece

321
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,420
keeps stirring up trouble for me.

322
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,260
Her audacity is outrageous!

323
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,420
At this rate,

324
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,020
her words might come to pass.

325
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,740
She might become the second Di Shengtian.

326
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,660
No one

327
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
in this world

328
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,420
should reach for this throne of mine.

329
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,220
Sir.

330
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,860
His Majesty summons you.

331
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,740
Is this about Miss Di?

332
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,380
I thought it was already over.

333
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,660
The Di family's case was overturned

334
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,260
and their name was cleared.

335
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,820
But exposing the truth to the people

336
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,420
humiliated Han Zhongyuan.

337
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,260
He will not tolerate this.

338
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,780
He could contain his fury

339
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,020
during the birthday banquet.

340
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,740
But with the Empress Dowager gone,

341
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,260
someone will have to

342
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,820
face his fury.

343
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,380
That means you could get yourself killed.

344
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,620
I must keep Ziyuan safe.

345
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,620
Only I can take on this burden for her.

346
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,180
Sir.

347
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,940
-But...
-Linlang.

348
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,900
Don't try to persuade me.

349
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,020
I've made up my mind.

350
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,860
I know you understand me better than anyone else.

351
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,460
Understood.

352
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,980
So,

353
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,980
if I don't return,

354
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,740
you know what to do.

355
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Once you've left,

356
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,700
I'll shut down Lingxiang Pleasure House

357
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,700
for a while.

358
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,860
If you never come back,

359
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,380
all the resources of the Qianyue Pavilion

360
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,020
will be handed over to Miss Di.

361
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,780
Good.

362
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,700
Sir!

363
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,100
[Ren's Residence]

364
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,980
Young Lady.

365
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,380
Your moves make your intention too obvious.

366
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,900
I'm not an old woman.

367
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,580
I can't be as ascetic as an abbot

368
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,620
in a temple.

369
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,060
A mere mortal can never break free from desires.

370
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,900
If you still have feelings for His Highness,

371
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,340
that is understandable.

372
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,540

00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,500
But it no longer concerns the Di family.

556
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,060
It concerns the whole nation.

557
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,260
The Minister of Justice is sent to prison
for the crime of deceiving the Emperor.

558
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,500
This is a serious matter.

559
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,900
I know what you mean.

560
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,820
But if I...

561
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,780
I'd save you

562
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,820
if I were you.

563
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,620
I'm not doing this for Ziyuan,

564
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,100
but to maintain order in the nation.

565
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,540
There's no way to absolve me
of the crime of deceiving the Emperor.

566
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,060
You may be the Crown Prince,

567
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
but what can you do?

568
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,260
The Di family are no longer traitors.

569
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,740
Ziyuan is no longer the daughter
of a sinned official.

570
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,860
So she never needed
the imprisonment on Dai Mountain.

571
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,100
You do not disappoint.

572
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,340
I can't stay here too long.

573
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,380
I should get going.

574
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
I will figure out a way
to send you better medicine.

575
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,820
Take care of yourself.

576
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,220
[Prison]

577
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,820
I've talked to the guards inside.

578
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,900
When you visit him,

579
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,540
they won't stop you.

580
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,100
Thank you.

581
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,300
He hasn't been treated well

582
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,860
in prison.

583
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,620
If he sees you,

584
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,780
he should feel much better than seeing me.

585
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
No one would be happy to be locked up

586
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,620
in prison.

587
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,020
It's not right for His Majesty to punish him.

588
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,580
I'll do my best to argue with this decision.

589
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,780
But it's far more difficult than it seems.

590
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,500
Isn't it obvious enough?

591
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,620
His Majesty is out for a payback.

592
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,300
Don't bother apologizing on his behalf.

593
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,100
What we seek

594
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,660
is never your apologies.

595
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,020
Ziyuan.

596
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,580
You may hate me,

597
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,500
but you've always trusted me.

598
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Isn't that right?

599
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,380
Yes.

600
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,620
Otherwise,

601
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,140
I wouldn't have given you that hand fan.

602
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,260
Trust me once more.

603
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,500
I will get Luo Mingxi out of there.

604
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,060
You will get the justice you deserve.

605
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,100
Very well.

606
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,780
Ziyuan.

607
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,620
The poem on the fan you gave me

608
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,060
does not mention the end

609
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,020
but only the beginning.

610
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,420
Is your feeling for me real or false?

611
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,100
The truth hasn't been announced to the public.

612
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,140
Between the two of us,

613
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,820
there is no room for love.

614
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,740
Don't give me that look.

615
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,380
I'm fine.

616
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,140
You call this fine?

617
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,820
I am fine.

618
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,820
But you, on the other hand,

619
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,380
is quite amazing.

620
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,340
You come and go

621
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,820
as you please in this prison.

622
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,940
I can do great things,

623
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,580
but your body isn't doing very well.

624
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,060
You know what kind of a place

625
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,660
the prison is.

626
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,900
Whoever comes in here

627
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,660
will never leave unscathed.

628
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,420
You're too delicate. All this torture

629
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,620
could have killed you.

630
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,620
You should have...

631
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,380

632
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,820
I know what you want to say.

633
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,340
But there are still uncertainties.

634
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,140
Do not act recklessly.

635
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580
And you're being careless

636
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,060
for coming here.

637
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,300
If anyone sees this...

638
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,180
I'm here to see you.

639
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,220
How is that careless?

640
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,420
It's not what I mean.

641
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,860
I'm happy to see you.

642
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,380
Look at yourself.

643
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,500
How can you still be happy?

644
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,420
I was born to serve the Di family.

645
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,660
These wounds are nothing.

646
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,500
I don't regret what I did.

647
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,020
Don't let this bother you.

648
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,220
See this place?

649
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,780
Most of the torture devices were designed by me.

650
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,940
I know how to make it less painful.

651
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,300
Trust me on that.

652
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,260

Before I came here,

654
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,300
I even brought good medicine with me.

656
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,380
I'll get you out of this place.

658
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,420
from everyone in the imperial court.

659

He wants to get rid of everyone close to you.

660
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,900
When I stood up, of course
he wouldn't have spared me.

661
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,740
Don't be concerned about me.

662
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,860
Above all, remain steadfast.

Do you plan to stay here forever?

665
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,420
Do you want to die here?

666
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,300
Have you lost your mind?

667
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,500
Keep a level head.

Had it not been for Luo Mingxi's act of loyalty,

00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,740
could Ren Anle have been able

682

to clear the name of the 80,000 lost souls?

683
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,900

so what crime has he committed?

get the better of him.

Yes.

with any crimes.

Nothing could go wrong.

Greetings, Your Majesty.

You've always sided with the Di family

00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,340
Yes.

740
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,580
Luo Mingxi is imprisoned.

741
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,700
He was tortured.

742
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,940
His life hangs by a thread.

743
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,820
I think

744
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,260
it's time to release him.

745
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,100
What if I refuse?

746
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,220
You've kept him alive

747
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,660
for so long.

748
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,180
So, you mean to release him eventually.

749
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,500
Besides,

750
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,340
you know very well

751
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,140
that Luo Mingxi's action

752
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,100
wasn't the crime of deceiving the Emperor.

753
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,740
He did it out of his loyalty.

754
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,420
What he did

755
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,900
saved the Han family's reputation

756
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,940
because we didn't wrong Marquis Jing'an as badly.

757
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,140
I understand

758
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,260
that you have your frustration.

759
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,900
Therefore, you're reluctant to release him.

760
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,540
I shall share your worries.

761
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,740
So I propose

762
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,300
that Luo Mingxi is released.

763
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,260
Aren't you a sensible one?

764
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,140
Your Majesty.

765
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,660
I have another matter to mention.

766
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,580
Speak.

767
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Outside Chongyang Gate

768
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,580
are scholars kneeling to plead

769
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,940
for the Di family.

770
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
When will they relent?

771
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,180
These fools

772
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,620
believe in baseless rumors

773
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,900
and think they can be the judge

774
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,740
of what is right or wrong!

775
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,020
Calm down, Your Majesty.

776
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,260
I must

777
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,660
congratulate you.

778
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,180
My imperial court is turned upside down!

779
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,460
Why are you congratulating me?

780
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,460
The 80,000 soldiers died.

781
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,060
All officers of the Di family
were wronged for ten years.

782
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,220
All of these happened because the Han family

783
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,460
acted out of greed.

784
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,940
If these scholars are willing to plead,

785
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,140
it means

786
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,860
they have faith in the Jing State.

787
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,260
They have faith that you will set up an example

788
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,740
by clearing the Di family's name

789
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
and bring justice to the world.
