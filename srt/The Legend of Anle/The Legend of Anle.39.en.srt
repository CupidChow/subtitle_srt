00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,770
Yes, I am.

194
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,530
I'm thrilled.

195
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,300
Also,

196
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,890
Ziyuan won't have to marry someone else.

197
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,530
Your Highness.

198
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,890
Both of you are in love with each other,

199
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,730
and you've come this far.

200
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,490
On top of our love,

201
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,890
there are the empire

202
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,890
and power struggles.

203
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,650
I'm the Crown Prince of the Han family.

204
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,370
If I were to take Ziyuan as my wife,

205
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,650
she will be dragged into the mire.

206
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
I used to think I only had to grow strong

207
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,130
to protect her under my wing

208
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,010
and stay with her.

209
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,650
But after all that happened,

210
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,650
I'm shaken.

211
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,300
Your Highness,

212
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,770
do you really want to give up?

213
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,890
Whenever I was in a pickle,

214
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,010
you would ask me this.

215
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,530
Now, I'll throw this question back at you.

216
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,890
Are you willing to give up?

217
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,250
The wedge between our families is huge.

218
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,650
The Luo family once supported the Di family,

219
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,130
and Luo Mingxi has protected Ziyuan
since he was little.

220
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,100
Compared to me,

221
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,010
he's the right one.

222
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,420
Your Highness.

223
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,300
Have your heart ever swayed for her

224
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,420
when Ziyuan accompanied you

225
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,010
as a mute maid?

226
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,890
It's getting late.

227
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,300
I'll head back now.

228
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,890
I always hoped

229
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,650
you could follow your heart once.

230
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,810
[Ren's Residence]

231
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,690
Congratulations, please come in.

232
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,930
Official Wang, Official Zhang.

233
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,100
Glad to see you here.

234
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,570
Please come in.

235
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,810
You may leave.

236
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,050
-Yes.
-Yes.

237
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,460
Ziyuan.

238
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,690
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,220
I couldn't persuade His Highness.

240
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,690
He refuses to budge.

241
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,810
Not anyone can talk him out.

242
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,050
Look, am I pretty today?

243
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,410
You're pretty no matter what you wear.

244
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,460
But His Highness isn't here,

245
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,690
why did you dress up...

246
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,690
Ziyuan.

247
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,290
Are you really going to marry Official Luo?

248
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,530
A woman dresses to please the one she admires.

249
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,460
What did Grand Aunt say?

250
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,290
Madam Di said

251
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,290
she would try her best.

252
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,050
Besides, she said,

253
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,930
"You shouldn't rely on me too much.

254
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,810
Little lass,

255
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,220
you can't always order me around.

256
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,930
That is disrespectful."

257
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,690
Maybe.

258
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,050
I took after her, after all.

259
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,290
Ziyuan.

260
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,460
What are you talking about?

261
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,220
What did you ask her to do?

262
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,290
Madam Di.

263
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,650
Today is the wedding of Ziyuan.

264
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,810
I'm sure the entire capital is filled with joy

265
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,140
and adorned with red streamers everywhere.

266
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,890
Are you staying here

267
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,050
because you want to avoid that?

268
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,290
She's met a devoted man,

269
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,290
I'm happy for her.

270
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,810
Madam Di.

271
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,930
I wish her a carefree,

272
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,690
peaceful, and happy life.

273
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,690
Is that my wishful thinking?

274
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,050
A peaceful, happy,

275
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,930
and carefree life

276
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,690
is the most common wish for ordinary people.

277
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,410
But to you,

278
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,340
this seems to be beyond your reach.

279
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,690
But Ziyuan

280
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,930
has never submitted to her destiny.

281
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,050
For the Di family,

282
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,340
she went against the sovereignty

283
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,290
and ruler.

284
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,220
Despite this, she has contributed
her only selfish desire

285
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,170
to you.

286
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,050
I know

287
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,290
you harbor doubts.

288
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,810
Go on.

289
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,410
Madam Di.

290
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,810
Back then, you relinquished
half of the empire of the Di family.

291
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,170
Was it for the people

292
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,690
or...

293
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,690
my grandfather?

294
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,410
If I hadn't had affection for him,

295
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,140
I wouldn't have been assisting him
for half of my life.

296
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,050
I indeed wished the nation

297
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,170
to be peaceful and harmonious.

298
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,810
But I didn't relinquish the empire.

299
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,460
I met Zi'an

300
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,930
on Cang Mountain that day.

301
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,810
Only then

302
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,220
did I realize the vastness of this land.

303
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,930
After we went through
some desperate situations,

304
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,690
I'd decided

305
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,690
to assist him lifelong.

306
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,050
The half of the empire

307
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,530
was my effort.

308
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,690
I had never once thought of possessing it,

309
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,930
so I didn't relinquish it.

310
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,690
Madam Di.

311
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,170
Did you tell my grandfather

312
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,930
about this?

313
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,180
In this life,

314
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,180
I've ditched mortally desires

315
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,460
to lead a desirable life.

316
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,940
Everything on my mind comes true

317
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,570
and everything I want will be achieved.

318
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,810
Only him,

319
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,940
I dared not approach him

320
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
for my whole life.

321
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,700
At times, I ponder.

322
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,050
Is it the wrong time?

323
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,810
Is he the wrong person?

324
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,940
Or both time and person

325
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,180
are wrong?

326
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,050
Han Ye.

327
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,940
I've never regretted

328
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,530
meeting Han Zi'an.

329
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,290
Since we met at the wrong timing,

330
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,810
we could only be friends.

331
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,290
I thought I'd concealed my feelings well.

332
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,700
I didn't know

333
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,130
I'd hurt someone.

334
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,700
Sun Yujun was right.

335
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,330
I was too selfish.

336
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,420
My selfishness

337
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,940
has brought tragedy to both Di and Han families,

338
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,570
causing irretrievable damage.

339
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Han Ye.

340
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,530
Both you and Ziyuan are in a different case.

341
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,220
You're not Han Zi'an,

342
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,850
and Ziyuan isn't Di Shengtian.

343
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
You shouldn't let

344
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,330
the same tragedy repeat itself.

345
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,370
This is a wedding gift for Ziyuan.

346
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,900
Bixi Sword.

347
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,980
Your father delivered the sword over.

348
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,460
He's guarded this sword for a decade

349
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,500
and been stuck in a dilemma the whole time

350
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,850
because of the two families.

351
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,050
Finally,

352
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,660
he has let go of it.

353
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,260
You should let go of it too.

354
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,940
It's too late.

355
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,940
Nothing

356
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,940
can be changed now.

357
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:16,980
No, it's not.

358
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,130
Mingxi.

359
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,020
I believe Han Ye will regret it for a lifetime

360
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,700
for not seeing you in this gown.

361
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,260
If he doesn't show up,

362
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,740
I'm going to choose an auspicious day

363
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,570
to stomp on his residence
with my 30,000 naval forces.

364
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,220
This is the spirit of Ziyuan I know should have.

365
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,780
Your sister is getting married today.

366
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,260
What are you doing here?

367
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,220
The bridegroom is still here.

368
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,940
Where else should I go?

369
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,650
I'm here to relay her message.

370
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,170
She said,

371
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,780
"If you don't come to me today,

372
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,260
I'll return to Jingnan with Bixi Sword

373
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,300
and start a new sovereignty

374
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,540
from the ally of the Di and Luo families.

375
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,130
I wonder which woman you should marry

376
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,780
to secure your throne by then."

377
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,460
Ridiculous.

378
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,940
Your Highness.

379
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,980
Ziyuan also said,

380
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,700
