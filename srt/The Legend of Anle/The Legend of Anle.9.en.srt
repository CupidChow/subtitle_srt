that Anning must have known

to prepare the horses and wait,

why is Wen Shuo allowed

to go inside with them?

178
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,910
Remember that before the assassin
showed up yesterday,

179
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,600
Young Lady ordered me
to help him with his revision?

180

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,240
Official Ren.

189
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,270
While you were drinking
and getting to know everyone,

190
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,150
His Highness seemed very fidgety.

191
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,910
Yeah.

192
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,120
Yeah.

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
After all, I am a beautiful woman.

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,150
So many men

195
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,000
in the capital have been smitten by me.

196
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
His Highness might look

197
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
calm and composed most of the time,

198
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,440
but he's got a green-eyed
monster living inside him.

199
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,150
That's right.

200
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,150
Official Ren,

201
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,600
you used to spend a lot of time
in Lingxiang Pleasure House

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,870
and often jested with the men there.

203
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,030
How could I not worry?

204
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,600
Your Highness, you are absolutely right.

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,360
I admit that this is my fault.

206
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
In the future, I won't leave you waiting alone

207
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
in our chamber.

208
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,030
Here's to you, Your Highness.

209
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,080
Look at that.

210
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
You naughty girl.

211
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
To think

212
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,480
that the noble C-C-Crown Prince

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,080
is in l-l-love with a female pirate!

214
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,120
That's fine.

215
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,320
Anle is offering her 30,000 navy forces as dowry.

216
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,750
This is a sincere gift

217
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,120
that no one could ever pass up,

218
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
even for the Crown Prince.

219
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,120
Yeah.

220
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,840
Actually, we've heard

221
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,740
so much about your love story.

222
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,780
That's why we've prepared a little token

223
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,660
to celebrate your engagement in advance.

224
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,150
Yeah!

225
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,750
This way, please.

226
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,150
Official Zhong, you can't do this.

227
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,510
Anle is a court official.

228
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,470
She cannot accept expensive gifts.

229
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,540
Your Highness, you sound

230
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,630
as if you're denying our sincere thoughts
for Official Ren.

231
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,750
These are celebratory gifts,

232
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,660
not bribes.

233
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,780
Have you ever seen anyone reject

234
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,270
gifts meant for newlyweds?

235
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,270
Who are you informing on this time?

236
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,510
Both memorials are naturally
informing on Ren Anle.

237
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,030
Why two memorials?

238
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,750
This memorial
is about Ren Anle accepting bribes.

239
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,780
Accepting bribes?

240
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,900
Your brother loves giving presents

241
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
for the purpose of future extortion.

242
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,420
Once Ren Anle takes the bait,

243
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,510
she will be convicted of bribery.

244
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,150
Well,

245
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,580
what about this one?

246
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,950
[Memorial from Marquis Zhongyi, Gu Yunnian]

247
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,630
It's a five-colored glazed jar.

248
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,270
His Highness and I

249
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,150
are grateful for the sincerity you've shown us.

250
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,030
Anyhow,

251
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,990
just the grand occasion today

252
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,780
feels like

253
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,630
a wedding banquet for His Highness and me.

254
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,270
Official Ren, you're a wise woman.

255
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:00,990
You guys.

256
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,780
Put the gifts away.

257
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,390
After today's banquet,

258
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,300
send them to Official Ren's residence.

259
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,510
Yes, sir.

260
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,270
Wait.

261
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,150
Since I likened this to a wedding banquet,

262
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,750
your presents can be considered
as wedding gifts.

263
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,270
So, it is important

264
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,030
for His Highness and I

265
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,630
to make a list of the wedding gifts.

266
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,750
Boy, get me some paper and a brush.

267
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,900
Do list your names

268
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,390
and your gifts on the paper provided.

269
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:24,990
All right.

270
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,660
Official Zhong, you...

271
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,390
Anle's request

272
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,700
seems reasonable to me.

273
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,870
Official Ren.

274
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,390
T-T-These are just meager tokens of our blessings.

275
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,750
Y-Y-You don't have to list them down, do you?

276
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,390
Why not?

277
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,030
Of course I have to.

278
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,750
Otherwise, His Highness and I

279
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,660
won't be able to repay your kindness.

280
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,510
Do we really have to write it down?

281
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,780
What should we write?

282
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:06,900
Come.

283
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,510
Please go ahead.

284
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,270
What should we do?

285
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,700
She doesn't remember any of you.

286
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,390
Make it up.

287
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,030
It's not a guillotine.

288
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,870
Why are you so nervous?

289
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,630
Well...

290
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,200
[Jin]

291
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,900
What is it, Wen Shuo?

292
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,990
I'm sure his surname is Gu.

293
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,750
Since when did he change his surname to Jin?

294
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,110
That's m-my mother's surname.

295
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,750
Mr. G-G-Gu.

296
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,150
Honesty is the best policy.

297
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,270
His Highness is watching.

298
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,510
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,150
Everyone.

300
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,390
This is my brother.

301
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,870
He has a photographic memory.

302
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,270
Don't try to fool him.

303
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,780
Yes.

304
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,270
I raised him up personally.

305
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,030
I can vouch

306
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,780
for his photographic memory.

307
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,870
My surname is Gu.

308
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,320
[Gu]

309
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,700

311
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,030
Everyone.

312
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,420
Look closely.

313
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,780
This is your very own admission

314
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,870
of your attempt to bribe a court official.

315
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,030
I...

316
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,510
I...

317
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,630
Wen Shuo, pass this to Yuanqin

318
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,540
and send it to the courier station.

319
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,780
Make sure it reaches His Majesty.

320
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,390
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,270
This...

322
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,820
This won't do.

323
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,390
What should we do now?

324
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,750
Bribing a third-rank official
with exotic treasures.

325
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
This is a serious offense.

326
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,660
We could even confiscate your properties.

327
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,150
Spare us!

328
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,500

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,390
You didn't do anything wrong or try to bribe me.

334
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,510
Why are you kneeling too?

335
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,780
Right, Your Highness?

I guess we've run out of rations again,

355
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,510
and the disaster victims
must have heard of your arrival,

356

so they're here to cause trouble.

the emergency funds
will only arrive four days from now.

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,510
It's your fault, Your Highness.

If it weren't for your visit,

365
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,030
you wouldn't have implicated these squires

366

and the people here.

yet the Crown Prince refuses to show himself!

370
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,710
He even sent his soldiers to block us!

371
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,580
Does he have any respect for us?

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,580
No.

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,270
the disaster relief arrangements.

377
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
The funds have not arrived yet

378
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,910
and the government's granary is empty.

379
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,910
I have a quicker solution to this issue.

380
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,620
Your Highness, please enlighten us.

381
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,620
These squires can make up for their crimes

382
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,710
by opening
their private granaries to the public.

383
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,470
This...

384
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,910
We don't have any rations either.

385
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,340
I...

386
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
If they don't have rations as well,

387
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,140
the evidence of their bribery

388
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,860
will soon reach His Majesty.

389
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,300
Everyone!

390
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,860
The Crown Prince
is turning a blind eye to our plight.

391
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,620
We should just barge our way in

392
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
and demand an explanation!

393
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,230
Yes! Let's go!

394
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,140
Make him come out!

395
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,710
Let's go!

396
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,230
Back off!

397
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,780
Come out!

398
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,380
The Crown Prince's visit to the South

399
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,230
might start a riot instead.

400
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,380
Zhong Liwen may be punished eventually,

401
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,230
but our Crown Prince

402
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,230
may have to bear the main responsibility.

403
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,780
This is a deadlock.

404
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,300
That depends on who's playing this game.

405
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,990
Despite Zhong Liwen's careful scheming,

406
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,140
he forgot a random factor on Han Ye's side.

407
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,140
What do you mean, sir?

408
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,620
Ren Anle has 30,000 navy forces
under her command

409
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,540
and all of them have pledged their loyalty to her.

410
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,860
A few thousand disaster victims
is all Zhong Liwen could muster.

411
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,990
He has underestimated her.

412
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,380
Your Highness, come out!

413
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,990
Your Highness.

414
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,230
Even if the squires donate their rations,

415
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,140
their residences are scattered
around the prefecture,

416
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,140
and it would take a long time...

417
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,540
-Exactly.
-That's right.

418
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,910
The disaster victims are roaring with anger.

419
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,620
Can we really appease them?

420
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,540
Your Highness.

421
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,140
Official Zhong.

422
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,910
Answer this.

423
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,140
The Crown Prince is trapped by a mob
while visiting your prefecture.

424
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,910
Is there anything you'd like to say?

425
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,910
I deserve to die.

426
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,620
Unfortunately, now that I'm also trapped,

427
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,340
I can't deploy more men here.

428
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,910
Your Highness.

429
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,380
I am unable to resolve this problem.

430
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,470
I...

431
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,610
I deserve to die!

432
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
I really deserve to die!

433
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,860
This isn't enough.

434
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,300
Your Highness.

435
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,430
I'm telling you, this isn't enough.

436
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,860
Not enough at all.

437
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,050
I deserve to die!

438
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,620
I really deserve to die!

439
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,380
Official Zhong.

440
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,510
What are you doing?

441
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
I meant that His Highness's Imperial Guards

442
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,750
are not enough to keep these people in check,

443
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,540
not that you haven't slapped yourself enough.

444
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,470
I...

445
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,540
You're right.

446
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,540
There are thousands
of disaster victims down there,

447
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,540
yet we only have a few dozen Imperial Guards.

448
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,540
Anle.

449
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,990
Before the sun sets,

450
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,230
can you help me keep an eye on the victims?

451
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,620
I told you before,

452
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,910
as long as it's what you wish,

453
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,990
I will do it for you.

454
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,620
Very well.

455
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,910
Official Zhong.

456
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,860
I do not jest.

457
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,620
I will personally visit the squires' residences
to collect rations.

458
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,620
Anle.

459
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:49,990
Wait for me.

460
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,540
Your Highness, I hope
we will not disappoint one another.

461
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,060
Your Highness!

462
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,910
[Wangjiang Terrace]
Your Highness!

463
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,990
Everyone.

464
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,470
As the Crown Prince of Jing, I promise you

465
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,540
that your rations will arrive today.

466
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,620
I ask for everyone to calm down.

467
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,780
Impossible!

468
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,230
This must be a trick to stall us!

469
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,910
Everyone.

470
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,230
His Highness is going to collect your rations

471
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,060
while I, Ren Anle, will stay here with you.

472
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,140
You may take me hostage.

473
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,910
Are you the pirate who got rid of the bandits

474
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,710
and punished the corrupted son
of a high-ranking official?

475
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
Since you have helped us

476
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,230
uphold justice before,

477
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,380
we will trust you this once.

478
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,540
So, you've all heard about me?

479
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,910
Your reputation

480
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,380
precedes you around Jiangnan.

481
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Since you're here,

482
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,620
we shall put our faith in His Highness too.

483
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,140
-Yes, we trust His Highness!
-We trust His Highness

484
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,620
Then, I promise everyone

485
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,230
that with me here,

486
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,100
His Highness will not abandon any of you.

487
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,620
-Great!
-Great!

488
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,580
-Great!
-Thank you, Official Ren!

489
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,230
We're finally getting food!

490
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,670
-Nice.
-Thank you, Your Highness!

491
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,710
Thank you, Official Ren!

492
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,470
The disaster victims are ecstatic.

493
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,060
I hope His Highness
manages to collect the rations successfully.

494
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,380
Everyone.

495
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,140
I was born in Jingnan

496
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
and I was a pirate,

497
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,910
so I know your fears

498
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,750
and needs.

499
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,300
I can also empathize

500
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,580
with your suffering.

501
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,140
So, please rest assured

502
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,380
that His Highness will bring your rations.

503
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,860
Your Highness.

504
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,910
The local government
has discovered a copper mine recently,

505
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,470
so we've submitted

506
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,620
half of our rations to the mine.

507
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,470
It's not that I don't want to give them to you,

508
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,540
but we really can't...

509
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,620
Fair enough.

510
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,620
Just give me the remaining half of your rations.

511
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,140
My residence's granary is far from here.

512
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,300
We'll set off immediately.

513
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,190
Show us the way.

514
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,860
Yes, Your Highness.

515
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,860
Over here.

516
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,060
Over here.

517
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,230
After I got rid of the Dongqian Pirates,

518
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,710
I tried to court the Crown Prince,

519
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,540
and I solved the metropolitan exam cheating case.

520
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,300
Then, I was given the chance
to join the Crown Princess selection,

521
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,380
so I've come to Jiangnan

522
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,780
to assist in the disaster relief efforts.

523
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,540
That's why I also have the chance

524
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,780
to meet all of you today.

525
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,600
Over here.

526
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Quick, over here.

527
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,380
Mother, I'm hungry.

528
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,230
-I want to eat something.
-There, there.

529
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,140
I'm hungry.

530
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,380
The sun is setting soon.

531
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,230
Is the Crown Prince coming back or not?

532
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,470
Mother, I'm hungry.

533
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,780
Calm down, everyone.

534
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,860
Don't worry. They'll be here soon.

535
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,300
Mother.

536
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,990
I know.

537
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,140
Everyone, I'm sure

538
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
they're just fooling us.

539
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,140
I've never heard that the Crown Prince

540
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,300
is bringing rations to Jiangnan.

541
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,860
He lied to us.

542
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,340
-Really?
-No food?

543
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,910
I think it's the wrong way.

544
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,910
Again?

545
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
It's all my fault.

546
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,860
Your Highness, I'm afraid it's impossible

547
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,540
for you to collect the rations before sunset.

548
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,990
If this goes on,

549
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,470
a riot would break out at Wangjiang Terrace.

550
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,950
Where's the food?

551
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,710
Where are our rations?

552
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,990
We want food!

553
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,470
Everyone!

554
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,910
We want food!

555
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,780
Give me food!

556
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,380
I want food!

557
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,540
Everyone!

558
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,380
Look!

559
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,620
His Highness has brought half of the rations.

560
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,060
Food!

561
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,950
It's food!

562
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,000
It's really food!

563
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,240
That's really food!

564
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,380
Let's grab some!

565
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,340
Everyone!

566
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,780
To ensure a smooth process,

567
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,780
please register your names,
and we'll issue the rations accordingly.

568
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,620
Official Ren.

569
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,820
Is this another trick?

570
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,270
Trying to stall us, huh?

571
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,270
Right, everyone?

572
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,270
Yeah!

573
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,950
Who knows if there's really food inside?

574
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,180
What if it's actually rocks and sand?

575
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,950
Yeah!

576
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,950
How should I prove it?

577
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,330
It really is food!

578
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,710
It's true. That's food.

579
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,950
It really is food.

580
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:10,950
It really is food?

581
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,510
There's food?

582
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,580
Have I proven myself?

583
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,660
Stay calm, everyone.

584
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,790
Let's queue up to register. Follow me.

585
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

586
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
-Queue up!
-Queue up!

587
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,340
Okay, we'll follow you!

588
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,070
(Zhong Liwen has planted
his men among the victims.)

589
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,990
I have ordered Jili to prepare
some fake sacks of rations,

590
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,420
but one sack tied with a black string
actually has rice inside.

591
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,030
What happens next

592
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,580
depends on you.

593
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,900
Your Highness,
when did you learn to pull off tricks like that?

594
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,790
As they say,

595
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,900
if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.

596
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
(I wonder how the Crown Prince is doing now.)

597
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,790
Next.

598
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,750
Sir, I'd like to register my name.

599
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,950
There are four people in my family.

600
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,620
Mother.

601
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,180
Yes.

602
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,510
I'm hungry.

603
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,470
My name is Chen Dali.

604
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:08,950
It's spelled Chen.

605
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,100
I'm famished.

606
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,420
Wait.

607
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:11,900
-You need to register first.
-Sir.

608
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I've got several kids waiting.

609
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,420
Let me take some rice.

610
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,950
I knew it was fake!

611
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:19,900
I...

612
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,180
My rice is fake,

613
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,820
and so is your identity.

614
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,420
If you dare to make a scene,

615
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,950
I'll stab right in.

616
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,180
Move it!

617
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,340
Take him away.

618
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,790
Yes, sir!

619
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,620
Official Ren, why are you arresting him?

620
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,750
He tried to stand up for us earlier.

621
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,030
-Release him!
-Release him!

622
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,420
Everyone.

623
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,900
He was cutting the queue.

624
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,420
If I do not punish him,

625
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,860
it would be unfair to those waiting in line,

626
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,660
and people might follow his lead.

627
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,180
By then,

628
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,620
how would the young and elderly
secure their rations?

629
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,420
His Highness is now

630
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,990
bringing more rations over.

631
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,380
Calm down, everyone.

632
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,180
You've been saying that

633
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,100
for several hours!

634
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,660
Yeah!

635
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,180
How much longer do we have to wait?

636
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,100
(Your Highness.)

637
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
(Hurry up.)

638
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,620
That's enough.

639
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,030
Our search ends here.

640
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:08,820
Your Highness.

641
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,750
We...

642
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,030
We haven't reached the place yet.

643
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,660
Your Highness!

644
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,750
I've got the rations!

645
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,100
Your Highness.

646
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,660
This is just part of the rations.

647
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,230
The rest

648
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,820
is being sent to Wangjiang Terrace as we speak.

649
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,660
Well done.

650
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:31,900
Back to Wangjiang Terrace.

651
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,950
Yes, Your Highness.

652
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,950
Let's go!

653
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,990
My rations!

654
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,820
At this rate,

655
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,340
we're going to die!

656
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,790
Is this really a trick?

657
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,270
We need an answer!

658
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,180
Give us an answer!

659
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,950
Anle.

660
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,340
You did a great job.

661
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,580
Everyone.

662
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
Thank you for waiting.

663
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,950
I hereby promise

664
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,420
that no citizen of Jing

665
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,820
will die of starvation in this nation.

666
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,230
Hooray!

667
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,260
Thank you, Your Highness!

668
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,070
-Thank you, Your Highness!
-Thank you, Your Highness!

669
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,270
This is great!

670
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
You're our savior!

671
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
Thank you, Your Highness!

672
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,550
You saved us!

673
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,100
Thank you, Your Highness!

674
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
With a body as frail as mine,

675
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,380
why would you even take a fancy to me?

676
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,950
Why not?

677
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,340
You have the most dashing looks in the nation,

678
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,270
so of course I'd take a fancy to you.

679
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,750
Your performance today

680
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,340
was admirable.

681
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,660
Ren Anle.

682
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,180
Thank you for everything you've done.

683
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,100
No need to thank me.

684
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,420
I told you, as long as it's what you wish,

685
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,660
I would do it for you.

686
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,750
Your Highness, do you really think

687
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,660
I'm going to do anything indecent

688
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,900
out here in the public?

689
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,990
I, Ren Anle, value my decency.

690
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,820
But the decent Ren Anle

691
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,310
has immense audacity in front of me.

692
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,420
Darn that Crown Prince.

693
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,820
Darn that Ren Anle!

694
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,660
Official Zhong.

695
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,340
Drink some tea.

696
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,420
Here.

697
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,660
Official Zhong.

698
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,660
In my opinion, you shouldn't worry.

699
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,660
After all, Mutian Prefecture is your territory.

700
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,270
The Crown Prince wouldn't threaten you here.

701
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,820
This is a disgrace! What do you know?

702
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,660
If

703
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,030
the Marquis was right,

704
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,660
their next step would be

705
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,950
investigating the floods in Jiangnan,

706
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,660
and all of us would be in trouble.

707
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,340
About the disaster relief effort,

708
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,750
how are you planning to thank me?

709
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,660
Anle.

710
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,550
You are a clever lady.

711
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,030
Your Highness, are you praising me?

712
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,950
Come on, tell me more.

713
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
During the banquet at Wangjiang Terrace,

714
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,420
Zhong Liwen tried to bribe you

715
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
so that he could extort you,

716
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,420
but you gave him a taste of his own medicine
by preparing that list of gifts

717
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,070
and made everyone spit out the relief funds.

718
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,860
For that, I also have to thank Your Highness

719
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,030
for nurturing Wen Shuo

720
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,100
and his photographic memory.

721
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,420
While I was collecting the rations,

722
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,660
you also sent Yuanshu

723
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,030
to search the rice shop's granary,

724
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,580
and even got her to sneak out
some ledgers that will be useful to us.

725
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,750
Your Highness,
since you're in the mood for praising,

726
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,180
you have to praise your heart out tonight

727
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,270
so that we're motivated

728
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,180
to do more.

729
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,510
Zhong Liwen may be a dunce,

730
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,140
but he's still a useful weapon

731
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,270
in the hands of Marquis Zhongyi.

732
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,420
Ren Anle, here's a question.

733
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,470
If we were to search for evidence
of Zhong Liwen's corruption,

734
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,380
where should we begin?

735
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,660
Obviously, the river dam project.

736
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,340
We spent millions to build
the dam at Yuanjiang River,

737
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,420
and it burst in less than a year.

738
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,340
Who knows how much funds

739
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,030
Zhong Liwen has usurped?

740
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,180
If that's the case,

741
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,900
we need to find
the river workers and ledger books.

742
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:04,950
I heard

743
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,820
that Zhong Liwen has an internal ledger book.

744
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,510
That's right.

745
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,950
The river workers will be the witnesses,

746
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,430
and the ledger books, the evidence.

747
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,510
If we were to investigate
the funds of the dam project,

748
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,300
we'd have to look into wage payments

749
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,140
and logistics.

750
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,430
The river workers

751
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,260
will show any discrepancies in payment,

752
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,580
and the internal ledger book

753
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,030
will shed the light

754
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,740
on logistics and other expenses.

755
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,180
Come in.

756
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,660
Your Highness.

757
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,350
Young Lady.

758
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,350
I've checked.

759
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,660
Zhong Liwen has summoned the 500 workers

760
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
from last year's dam project

761
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,830
to repair the river dam.

762
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,950
You're already investigating?

763
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,350
Of course.

764
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,260
Your Highness.

765
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,910
I went to the river dam and asked around.

766
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,300
The summoned workers
are not from last year's project.

767
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,430
So, you began the investigation
even earlier than me

768
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,660
and you've gone into more detail.

769
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,950
Why did you make me waste my breath, then?

770
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
It wasn't wasted.

771
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,830
It's for me to confirm

772
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,180
that you are truly Ren Anle.

773
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,030
Young Lady, Your Highness.

774
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,430
We take our leave.

775
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,910
So, it seems

776
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,430
that the internal ledger book and river workers

777
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,830
are both missing now.

778
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,910
Compared to a mere ledger book,

779
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,100
it's much harder to hide 500 river workers.

780
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,830
Your Highness, you mean

781
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,430
we should search for the river workers first?

782
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,780
Your Highness, are you
expecting me to start right now?

783
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,030
Your Highness.

784
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,550
You tried so hard to beat around the bush

785
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,260
and talked about work

786
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,700
just to avoid answering my question

787
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,550
about how you should thank me.

788
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,220
Your Highness, don't panic

789
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,260
and stop pretending.

790
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,700
Actually, you've already
given me a promise yesterday.

791
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,990
When?

792
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,470
Yesterday.

793
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,990
You said you were going to make me a Beauty.

794
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,260
Let's celebrate.

795
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,260
I was just saying that you're a beautiful woman.

796
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,990
That doesn't count.

797
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,990
Your Highness,
since you're pretending to be ignorant,

798
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,780
all the more reason why you should thank me.

799
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,470
I guess you are reluctant to have

800
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,990
even just one drink with me.

801
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,580
I knew it.

802
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,430
Now that you've made me do what you want,

803
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,260
I'm just a sword shelved away
in the depths of your closet.

804
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,740
What a wonderful night.

805
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
We finally get to spend
some private time together.

806
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,300
What should we do?

807

Your Highness?

808
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,300
Your Highness, you're born with such good looks.

809
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,580

the most handsome man in the capital.
