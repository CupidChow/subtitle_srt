00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,460
you bought so many snacks.

186
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,670
Are you eating them all?

187
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,860
It's not very nice to eat all of them myself, huh?

188
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,980
You can have this.

189
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,740
Anning.

190
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,340
This is for you.

191
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,150
Thank you.

192
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,790
Anning.

193
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,070
You know,

194
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,740
I have a brother

195
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,150
who is about his age.

196
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,030
He's a really strict guy.

197
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,860
Whenever he speaks,

198
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,430
I can't help but obey.

199
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,550
But you're different, Anning.

200
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,430
You keep him in check.

201
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,820
By the way,

202
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,700
Anning,

203
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,700
what else is nice and fun in the Jing State?

204
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,500
In Jing...

205
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,340
You need not bother yourself with Jing's affairs.

206
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,950
Things like flower exhibitions

207
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,740
and lantern festivals

208
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,220
are still some months away.

209
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,670
Anning.

210
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,270
Are you in a bad mood?

211
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,790
What about

212
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,430
I help cheer you up?

213
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,550
General.

214
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,100
Are you in a bad mood again?

215
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,740
I just find it hard to accept

216
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,310
that she's from Northern Qin.

217
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,580
Look, guys.

218
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,100
Which of these two is nicer?

219
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,950
This one.

220
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,820
I specially bought a pair of dragon
and phoenix candy art for you two.

221
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,070
A pair of dragon and phoenix?

222
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,860
It's just candy.

223

[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

224
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,460
Is there an update?

225
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,700
[Crown Princess candidate betting.
Someone placed a big bet on Mo Shuang.]

226
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,220
In the Crown Princess bet,

227
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,950
someone placed a big bet on Princess Mo Shuang.

228
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,740
Looks like we have another strong competitor.

229
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,980
We should find a way

230
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,790
to get to know this Princess of Northern Qin.

231
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,620
Brother.

232
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,340
Didn't I tell you to wait for me in Northern Qin?

233
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,390
What are you doing here?

234
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,820
Weren't you the one

235
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,950
who asked me to be married to Jing?

236
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,670
(Could it be that someone impersonated me?)

237
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,820
I just didn't expect you

238
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,460
to come so soon.

239
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,740
This won't do.

240
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,460
I only want to stay by your side.

241
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,220
I might not be able
to keep you company at all times,

242
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,030
but I promise to look after you.

243
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,100
I won't let you marry Jing's Crown Prince.

244
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,740
Because the Crown Prince

245
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,950
is very ugly.

246
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,820
All right, then.

247
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,620
I won't marry him.

248
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,740
I'll listen to you.

249
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,950
In politics,

250
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,550
it's all about strength.

251
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,310
A marriage of convenience
is usually the last resort.

252
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,430
Never mind.

253
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,550
Political affairs are complicated.

254
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,790
The less you know, the better.

255
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,670
It's true that I don't know politics.

256
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,030
But I do know

257
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,430
that there's a big market tomorrow.

258
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,700
I'm sure it will be lots of fun.

259
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,820
You can't go.

260
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,580
There are too many people.

261
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,700
It's dangerous.

262
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,430
But Anle invited me.

263
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,190
I heard from the storyteller

264
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,310
that she's a pro at catching bandits
and solving crimes.

265
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,820
I'm surely in good hands
with a capable person like that.

266
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,670
Ren Anle?

267
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,310
What is she up to?

268
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,910
Your Highness.

269
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,340
These are gifts
from the imperial court officials.

270
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,620
Really?

271
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,700
Let me see.

272
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,950
This is from the Left Chancellor.

273
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,950
It's beautiful.

274
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,620
-(So the Left Chancellor...)
-I love it.

275
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,700
(had planned all this.)

276
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,580
Ren Anle is devoted to the present Crown Prince.

277
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,220
Yet, His Highness's heart is with Di Cheng'en.

278
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,100
Now,

279
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,820
Di Cheng'en had been confined
on Dai Mountain for ten years.

280
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,070
Recently, she met with the Crown Princess
at Caiwei Pavilion.

281
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,980
The two came together in a tearful embrace.

282
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,580
What a touching sight it was.

283
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,670
But I heard the Princess of Northern Qin has come.

284
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,820
The two states' interest is surely
more important than this woman.

285
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,550
Ultimately, it's up to the Crown Prince.

286
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,950
As long as he likes her,

287
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,070
nobody else gets to have a say.

288
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,100
So the Crown Princess selection is a ruse?

289
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,700
Mu Qing,

290
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,980
did you hear?

291
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,740
His Highness only has eyes

292
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,220
for me.

293
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,340
Di Cheng'en.

294
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,620
Not Di Ziyuan.

295
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,100
All I saw was, in His Majesty's eyes,

296
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,860
you're just Di Cheng'en,

297
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
not Di Ziyuan.

298
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,740
It doesn't matter.

299
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,700
Right now, I'm the only one
His Highness cares about.

300
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,100
I lost ten years of my freedom.

301
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,860
This is what I deserve.

302
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,460
Mu Qing.

303
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,340
I want to be the only person in your eyes, too.

304
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,340
Where are we going now?

305
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,430
To see Princess Anning.

306
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,270
She's in charge of welcoming
the Princess of Northern Qin,

307
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,460
as well as a firm supporter of Ren Anle.

308
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,820
If she changes her mind and supports me,

309
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,460
I will be much closer

310
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,620
to becoming the Crown Princess.

317
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,220
Why are you here?

318
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,860
After being here for so long,

319
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,620
I haven't been able to see you.

320
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Recently, I met His Highness at Caiwei Pavilion,

321
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,700
so I thought of dropping by.

322
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,340
Ye's devotion to you
is just in keeping his promise.

323
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,460
You shouldn't read too much into it.

324
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I know.

325
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,460
After ten years,

326
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,860
many things have changed.

327
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,950
Even the way His Highness looks at me

328
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,740
seems distanced, just like you.

329
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,700
Anning.

330
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,860
There's a favor

331
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,580
I'd like to ask.

332
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
What is it?

333
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,980
It's the Crown Princess selection.

334
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,220
I wish you could support me.

335
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,700
His Majesty had scorned you.

336
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,820
But you're still thinking
about becoming the Crown Princess?

337

Anning.

338
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,620
I really don't want to go back to Dai Mountain.

339

I had nothing.

340
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,460
I'd be better dead than alive.

The ten years I spent on Dai Mountain

342
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,340
were insufferable.

343
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,700
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,460
I can't possibly imagine

345

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,250
(Anning.)

370
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
(If you won't help me,)

371
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,140
(someone else will.)

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,660
[Di Cheng'en. Noon at Caiwei Pavilion.]

373
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,600
[Marquis Zhongyi's Residence]

374
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,620
The daughter of a sinner

375
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,420
was locked up on Dai Mountain for ten years.

376
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,860
Just because of a will,

377
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,330
she was able to partake
in the Crown Princess selection

378
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,490
and even become a popular candidate.

379
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,810
Don't worry, My Lord.

380
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
She no longer has the Di family behind her.

381
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,700
She's just a stray.

382
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,380
Even if she's in the capital,

383
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,220
she won't make it far.

384
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,620
I got the news

385
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,010
that Di Cheng'en often goes out.

386
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,380
The streets are crowded.

387
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,140
It won't be hard to create an accident.

388
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,980
Because of Jiangnan
and the metropolitan exam incident,

389
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,770
His Majesty has grown weary of me.

390
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,770
Many of the ministers

391
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,660
also added insult to injury.

392
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,090
If we take action now,

393
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,660
we'd be giving them more hold on us.

394
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,730
You are right, My Lord.

395
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,770
Come and take a look at our rouge selection.

396
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,010
Miss, see anything you like?

397
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,490
Miss.

398
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,090
This really suits you.

399
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,250
Tanghulu!

400
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,370
Let me take you over there, okay?

401
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,290
Okay.

402
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,620
-Tanghulu.
-Have you had enough?

403
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,330
If so, let's go back.

404
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,770
Mu Qing.

405
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,330
Look.

406
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,810
Look how happy

407
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,180
the children and young ladies are.

408
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,220
There's no danger here.

409
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
If I

410
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,570
hadn't gone to Dai Mountain,

411
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,420
would I also be as happy as them?

412
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,730
No.

413
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,660
I just want to remind you of this.

414
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,490
This place may look nice and peaceful.

415
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,010
But in fact, dangers lurk in every corner.

416
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,290
Mu Qing.

417
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,050
It's rare for us to be out.

418
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,140
Cheer up a little, will you?

419
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,530
I know.

420
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,460
You were confined on Dai Mountain
for ten years alongside me.

421
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,220
It must have been hard for you, too.

422
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,460
I try to coax you,

423
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,530
but you never give in.

424
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,980
But I know.

425
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,730
You'll always stay by my side.

426
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,140
Right?

427
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,290
Let's go.

428
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,220
Anning.

429
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,770
Do not be rude to the General.

430
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,290
Where did you go?

431
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,090
I only wanted to give you guys a surprise.

432
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,010
I'm surprised the Princess of Northern Qin
is this petite and adorable.

433
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,570
I was also taken aback

434
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,730
when I first saw her.

435
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,180
Tanghulu!

436
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,900
Are you Ren Anle?

437
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,420
You're just like what's described in the huaben.

438
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,180
Steaming hot buns!

439
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,380
"Ren Anle, dressed in striking red,

440
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,770
appears on horseback."

441
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,330
I wonder if my 30,000-strong navy

442
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,980
is comparable to Your Highness' betrothal gift.

443
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,770
The women of the Jing State
are truly outstanding,

444
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,460
each one more formidable than the other.

445
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,620
This place is awesome.

446
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,420
As a woman from Northern Qin,

447
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,380
you must be used to desert storms.

448
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,230
I'm guessing you're brave
and good at fighting, too.

449
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,220
Actually...

450
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,290
Aside from eating,

451
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,900
I don't know anything else.

452
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,730
My brother is the good one.

Young Lady,

455
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,730
we found it.

456
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,460
There's a new wine shop at the merchant street.

457
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
The aroma is alluring.

458
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,730
I'm going to get a few vats.

459
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,140
There's still some time before the market starts.

460
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,380
Let's meet up after I'm done buying.

461
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,770
Okay.

462
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,380
Anle, come back soon.

463
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,770
I want to hear

464
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,980
your story in Jiangnan.

465
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,220
See you later.

466
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,980
Hey, Anning.

467
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,730
Let's go over there.

468
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,730
There seems to be fun stuff.

469

474
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,250
I heard the snack shop on the right of the street

475
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,460
is the best in town.

476
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,530
But the queue is always long.

477
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,980
I'm a little tired from walking.

478
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,620
Can you help me buy some?

479
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,730

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,980
What a surprise to have you visit my humble shop.
Please come in.

482
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,180
I'm just taking a look. Please carry on.

483
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,900
All right, please help yourself.

That's me.

I'm Ren Anle.

489
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,050
I didn't think I'd bump into Miss Di here.

490
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,530
You know me?

494
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,140
It's lonely up there.

495

The only things keeping me company

496
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,380
were the morning bells and evening drums,

497
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,140
oil lamps and the Buddha statues.

498
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,380
But thankfully,

499
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,900
I had some neat trinkets

500
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,620
the Crown Princess gifted me.

501
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,250
It helped to keep me entertained.

502
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,220
You've really suffered

503
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,730
the past ten years.

504
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,770
That's all in the past now.

Official Ren,

508
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,460
I shall take my leave.

509

Excuse me.

Help!

Come with me.

Official Ren?

518
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,770
Thank you for stepping up.

519
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,180
Why exactly did you
come to Caiwei Pavilion today?

520
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,290
Within the capital,

521
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,050
Caiwei Pavilion is the only place

522
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,140
I can visit.

523
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,660
Never mind.

524
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,810
This place is dangerous.

525
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,140
Since your bodyguard is here,

526
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,220
you should leave immediately.

527
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,010
Thanks again.

528
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,810

Are you okay?

531
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,460
Why did you suddenly come back?

532
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,860
Someone gave me this while I was on the street.

533
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
So I turned around.

548

your bad habit of walking without a sound.

549

If I were to change too,

550
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,460
you would have no one to reminisce about
in the capital.

742
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,940
Mingxi.

743
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,980
Both you and I know very well.

744
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,170
The Di family died aggrieved,

745
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,050
not from spears and swords,

746
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,690
but due to the despicable acts of others.

747
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,570
Even if I wish to redress the grievances
suffered by my people,

748
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,050
I will not resort to such methods

749
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,420
to accomplish my goal.

750
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:34,780
You must be tired.

751
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,300
I'll come and visit you another time.

752
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,940
Young Lady.

753
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,730
What's wrong with Official Luo?

754
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,570
Lengbei.

755
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,340
What are you...

756
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,460
Quiet.

757
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,650
You're such a liar.

758
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,900
When did I lie to you?

759
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,340
You totally lied to me.

760
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,940
The Crown Prince of Jing

761
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,300
is clearly a handsome man.

762
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,250
He's not at all ugly

763
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,250
like what you said.

764
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,530
You've met the Crown Prince?

765
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,250
I think

766
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,460
the Crown Prince is not only good-looking

767
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,690
but also kind.

768
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,820
Now,

769
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,690
I'm no longer that anxious
to go back to Northern Qin.

770
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,090
You must not fall for Han Ye.

771
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,090
Why not?

772
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,250
I think he's a good person.

773
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,530
Shuang.

774
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,210
The Jing State is going through a turbulent time.

775
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,210
I'm unable to protect you by myself.

776
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,420
Just listen to me.

777
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,900
You must not like the Crown Prince.

778
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,730
And you must not marry into Jing.

779
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:02,900
Got it?

780
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,820
Your Di Cheng'en survived unscathed,

781
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,170
while my subordinate got seriously injured.

782
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,050
How will you make up for this?

783
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,820
I was wrong

784
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,210
for not being forthright.

785
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,530
I will give up my own life

786
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,050
to repay it.

787
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,380
Your life?

788
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,340
Your life has always belonged to the Luos.

789
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,130
Moreover, there's someone you care about now.

790
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,690
Your life is worth nothing.

791
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,210
She's just a pitiful girl who is clueless.

792
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,690
An insignificant existence

793
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:47,980
before you, sir.

794
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,460
Precisely because she's clueless.

795
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,210
That's why I wanted you to keep her in check.

796
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,420
If she can do as she's told,

797
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,820
I shall let her live.

798
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,210
Yes, sir.

799
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,820
Remember.

800
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,980
So long as she behaves,

801
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,130
I can give her

802
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,250
what she wants.

803
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,860
(Once you get involved,)

804
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,250
(you've forfeited any real freedom.)

805
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,690
(As a pawn,)

806
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,130
(there is no way to break free
from the strategist's grasp.)

807
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,610
Official Ren.

808
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,780
Linlang.

809
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,210
What brings you here at this hour?

810
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:52,980
Official Ren.

811
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,940
The assassination attempt on Di Cheng'en

812
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,210
wasn't Official Luo's doing.

813
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,690
It was Marquis Zhongyi's people
who were after Di Cheng'en.

814
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,460
This incident happened

815
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,340
because I acted out of line.

816
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,820
Official Luo didn't want to tell you.

817
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,940
But I can't bear to see

818
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,340
the misunderstanding fester between you,

819
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,980
causing more issues.
