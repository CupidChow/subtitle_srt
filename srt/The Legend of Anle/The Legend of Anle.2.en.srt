the incident where Ren Anle encountered
the Crown Prince

and proposed to him with
30,000 naval soldiers as her dowry

191
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,730

the Crown Prince had described.

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,890

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,770
whether Ren Anle

198
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,060
can become the Crown Princess or not.

199
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,530
Why not?

200
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,940
The Crown Prince has been sending offerings
to Dai Mountain for ten years straight.

201
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Due to that...

202
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,890
Back then, our founding emperor
wanted the Di and Han family

203

to rule the nation together.

207

Even if she can't be the Crown Princess,

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,250
Be gentle.

368
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,420
I am being gentle.

369
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,660
Your Majesty.

370
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,180
Be gentle.

371
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm being gentle enough.

372
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,250
Your Majesty, are you okay?

373
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,090
Have some tea, please.

374
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,180
Your Majesty, now that you've had the tea,

375
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,730
that means

376
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,530
you acknowledged our marriage.

377
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,010
Ren Anle,

378
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,810
do not display such rudeness
in front of His Majesty.

379
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,420
The lady you brought back

380
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,900
is pretty interesting.

381
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,140
Your Majesty, you must've been worried.

382
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,290
This is my fault.

383
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,180
Your Highness,

384
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,050
the biggest fault of a son
is not having offsprings.

385
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,460
You still have a chance to atone for your mistake.

386
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,530
Your Majesty,

387
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,460
why don't you let us get married now?

388
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,530
We'll give you two grandchildren in three years.

389
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,380
Ridiculous.

390
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,290
I do think you two

391
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,290
suit each other.

392
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,290
What about this?

393
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,530
I'll confer you the title of Beauty.

394
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,100
-No.
-No.

395
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,100
Although His Highness and I

396
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,300
did spend one night together with great intimacy...

397
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,060
Wait.

398
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,620
Crown Prince, was she speaking the truth?

399
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,340
Your Majesty,

400
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,140
Miss Ren grew up
in an unconventional environment.

401
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,540
Please forgive her for using the wrong terms.

402
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,340
She did save me once.

403
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,060
I will remember

404
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,580
your kindness.

405
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,910
However, regarding the marriage,

406
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,140
I'm afraid I can't agree to it.

407
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,780
Crown Prince,

408
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,780
Anle is proposing to you
with 30,000 naval soldiers as her dowry.

409
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,750
Forget it.

410
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,540
It's pointless to keep arguing over this.

411
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,580
What about this?

412
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,100
I'll still give you command over my navy.

413
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,340
First, I don't want any rewards.

414
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,470
Second, I don't want any military merit.

415
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,270
Your Majesty, I just want you to give me a chance.

416
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
What kind of chance?

417
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,780
Since His Highness

418
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,100
doesn't want me to be the Crown Princess,

419
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm sure it's because he thinks

420
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,340
that my identity,

421
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,300
my abilities,

422
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,340
and my character don't match his.

423
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,750
However, if I can spend time

424
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,030
with His Highness in the same room,

425
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,100
he might develop

426
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,510
feelings for me.

427
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,780
He might look at me in a different light.

428
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,860
So, you wish to work with the Crown Prince?

429
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,670
That's right.

430
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,510
However, I need to give you a kind reminder.

431
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,540
I'm not really familiar with the officialdom.

432
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,060
Therefore, I prefer

433
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,580
an easy post with a good wage, a close range to home,

434
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
plenty of power, and no heavy duties.

435
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,540
This way,

436
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,860
I can spend time

437
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,270
with His Highness every day.

438
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,340
We did have women working in the imperial court

439
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,510
once in Jing State.

440
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,580
If so,

441
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,580
Crown Prince, what do you think?

442
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,580
Your Majesty,

443
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm currently in charge of
the Three Judicial Offices.

444
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,340
If that's the case,

445
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,060
let's make Miss Ren

446
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,100
the acting vice minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

447
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,820
At least she can learn
after the officials in Jing State.

448
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,860
Ren Anle,

449
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,510
what do you think about this position?

450
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,340
That's a nice name.

451
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,580
I like the Court of Judicial Review.

452
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,030
Thank you, Father-in-law...

453
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

454
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,950
Your Majesty,

455
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,300
are you sure you want this female pirate
to be Vice Minister of Justice?

456
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,380
Aren't you afraid that she'll mess things up?

457
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,060
She's just a girl.

458
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,100
However, her name struck fear

459
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,380
into the hearts of Dongqian Navy.

460
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,190
There's no way she's a nobody.

461
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,580
She's a double-edged sword.

462
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,140
She might be dangerous,
but useful in the right situation.

463
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,860
To hurt yourself or kill your enemy.

464
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,860
It depends on how you wield it.

465
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,860
[Court of Judicial Review]

466
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,670
(I think this case is almost done.)

467
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,340
(Yes. We can close the case soon.)

468
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,860
(Yeah. We found the clues.)

469
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,620
Official Ren, please.

470
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,430
Official Pei. Official Ren.

471
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,860
[Pei Zhan, minister of the Court of Judicial Review]
Today's my first day here.

472
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,380
So, do you have any cases for your boss...

473
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,910
You're the vice minister.

474
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,190
Vice minister.

475
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,340
So, do you have any cases

476
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,100
for me, the vice minister?

477
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,030
Official Ren,

478
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,860
we don't have any important cases today.

479
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,860
We've handled all of them.

480
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,270
That won't do.

481
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,670
Why don't you guys

482
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,510
make something up for me?

483
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,910
What?

484
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,430
She's messing around.

485
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,580
What does she mean by this?

486
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,580
Actually,

487
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,340
I thought this was a temple

488
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,910
when I was told the name of this department.

489
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,100
After that, His Highness told me

490
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,340
this was where cases are handled.

491
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,860
That's why

492
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,620
I have to find something to do.

493
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,340
If not,

494
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,620
I won't be able to become the Crown Princess.

495
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,670
Official Ren.

496
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,580
My name is Huang Pu.

497
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,420
[Huang Pu]
I have

498
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,670
[vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review]
the same rank as yours.

499
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,670
There's a murder case related to Lin Cong,
son of Lin Guozhong,

500
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,990
Director of the Ministry of Works.

501
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,580
It has been here for some days.

502
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,860
The case hasn't been closed yet.

503
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,860
Huang Pu, what are you doing?

504
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,620
About that,

505
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,860
it was just that a group of people
pushed around after drunk

506
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,100
and the victim fell to his death

507
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,380
by accident.

508
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,340
Look, I wrote it myself.

509
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,950
It's stated clearly on the scroll.

510
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,650
[Fell and died accidentally]

511
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,430
Yeah.

512
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,140
Please remember

513
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,430
that you're only the vice minister.

514
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,430
Official Ren, come over.

515
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,580
You came at the right time.

516
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,750
As long as you

517
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,910
sign your name here,

518
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,270
you'll have a huge task completed.

519
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,140
Official Pei, I never expected you

520
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,100
to get me

521
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
such a huge case

522
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
on my first day here.

523
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,470
[Ren Anle]

524
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,670
Okay.

525
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,950
Case closed.

526
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,620
Official Du.

527
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,100
Okay.

528
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
The rest of you,

529
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,860
go back if you have no other business here.

530
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,100
You're dismissed.

531
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,580
We shall take our leave.

532
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,860
Official Ren,

533
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,860
Marquis Zhongyi admires you greatly.

534
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,100
Since he does,

535
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,580
I have to perform well.

536
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,340
Official Ren, I will thank you on his behalf.

537
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,910
You flatter me.

538
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,860
Why are you still here?

539
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,340
I thought you were a ghost.

540
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,380
Another accomplice to the tyrant.

541
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
(Gu Yunnian,)

542
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,380
(you can take this case)

543
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,950
(as my meeting gift for you.)

544
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,950
[Court of Judicial Review]

545
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,430
Your Highness.

546
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,580
Greetings, Your Highness.

547
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,580
Your Highness,

548
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,190
I thought Ren Anle would stir things up

549
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,580
in the Court of Judicial Review.

550
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,580
But it's pretty quiet.

551
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,100
On my way here,

552
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,860
I did encounter many officials

553
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,910
who said they wanted to rest at home

554
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,910
as they felt unwell.

555
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,670
Your Highness,

556
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,580
I'm afraid this is a huge mess.

557
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,380
In the end, Ren Anle is just a village girl.

558
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,060
What if she falls for the temptation

559
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,340
and joins Marquis Zhongyi's rank?

560
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,860
We'll never know.

561
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,670
Petty people are adept at flattery

562
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,380
while gentlemen...

563
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,140
Do not suspect without reasons?

564
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
That's not right.

565
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,860
Your Highness, she was so infatuated with you...

566
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,510
She has gained a foothold in Jingnan
for so many years

567
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,380
and has 30,000 naval soldiers under her command.

568
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
She definitely isn't someone
as superficial as that.

569
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,540
Your Highness, are you saying...

570
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,670
She's good at pretending.

571
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,140
To the current Court of Judicial Review,

572
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,380
this is a good thing.

573
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,380
Wen Shuo.

574
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,140
Yes, Your Highness.

575
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,270
Head to the carriage

576
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,430
and move my stuff here later.

577
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,140
Okay.

578
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,270
Official Pei, what are you...

579
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,950
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

580
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,710
Could it be

581
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,060
that you're worried about me?

582
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,860
I'm worried about the Court of Judicial Review.

583
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,620
Why are you here alone?

584
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,430
It's because I prayed sincerely every day

585
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,950
for a chance to spend some time alone

586
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,580
with Your Highness.

587
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,140
I'm sure you feel the same,

588
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,140
right?

589
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,100
(This box is so heavy.)

590
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,580
Your Highness?

591
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,380
Pleasant opportunities like these do fly by, huh?

592
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,270
Your Highness,

593
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,340
we've brought the things you wanted.

594
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,670
So Your Highness is here to deliver gifts to me?

595
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,670
You can think of it that way.

596
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,620
Your Highness, I'll definitely cherish

597
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,860
your gifts.

598
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,820
You said so yourself.

599
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Of course.

600
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,140
What is this?

601
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,340
"Law of Jing and Its Interpretation".

602
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,580
How do you read this?

603
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,060
"Records of False Convictions".

604
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
And "Law and Punishments of Jing".

605
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,910
Why give me so many scrolls?

606
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,620
Your Highness, are you joking with me?

607
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,950
The Court of Judicial Review

608
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,510
is in charge of the legal trials of the nation.

609
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,860
Your title requires

610
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,620
that you familiarize yourself with Jing's law

611
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,860
and remember all the articles by heart.

612
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,340
Only then can you perform your duty at ease.

613
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,670
Do I have to go through all this trouble?

614
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,670
You volunteered to take up this post.

615
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,470
Hey, besides these,

616
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,380
you have one more box of books here.

617
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,140
You promised His Highness

618
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,190
that you would cherish them.

619
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,340
Finish them in seven days.

620
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,670
Memorize them in one month.

621
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,670
Your Highness, you're grilling me on fire.

622
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,580
Your Highness,
I think I understand your intention.

623
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,060
I don't know a lot of words

624
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,030
so I'll have countless questions to ask you.

625
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,860
I'm sure you give me so many books

626
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,060
so we can spend more time alone, right?

627
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,860
This is ridiculous.

628
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,340
Ren Anle,

629
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,860
we don't have much time.

630
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,140
I'll teach you something practical first.

631
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,430
We have plenty of time.

632
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,860
Your Highness, you can explain

633
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,580
each word to me one by one.

634
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,340
These are tricks you can use for litigation.

635
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
It's called the Five Listenings.

636
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,100
What?

637
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,670
Five Listenings.

638
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,140
You listen, I listen, he listens,

639
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,100
and what else?

640
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,950
First, listen to what they say.

641
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,140
Second, listen to their expression.

642
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,340
-Third...
-I know.

643
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,140
I know about this.

644
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,860
I already used the previous two Listenings

645
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,580
in our encounter.

646
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,580
Your Highness, when I first saw you,

647
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,910
I knew you had a great voice.

648
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,620
You were good-looking, too.

649
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,860
Third, listen to their breathing.

650
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,580
Speaking of which,

651
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,140
Your Highness, I've never listened

652
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,340
to your breathing before.

653
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,580
Sit properly.

654
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,620
Fourth, observe
if they're listening to you attentively.

655
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,620
Fifth, look into their eyes.

656
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,140
Do you have any...

657
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,430
If I have to look into their eyes,

658
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,340
why did you avoid my eyes then?

659
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,540
Your Highness, do you have a guilty conscience?

660
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,670
I'm not a criminal.

661
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,860
You don't need to use that on me.

662
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,860
However, I think

663
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,190
the Five Listenings can be applied anywhere.

664
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,750
Your Highness.

665
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,100
Your Highness!

666
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,380
I think I saw my reflection

667
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,860
in your eyes.

668
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,510
Ren Anle, stop messing around.

669
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Take your books.

670
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,860
I'll bring you to the cell for practice.

671
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,950
What?

672
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,230
Are you taking revenge on me for teasing you?

673
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,750
I'll treat your silence as a yes.

674
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,950
This is interesting.

675
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,270
Your Highness!

676
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,370
[Court of Judicial Review]

677
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,140
Vice minister of the Court of Judicial Review

678
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,510
is only one rank below the minister.

679
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,910
Not only do you need to hold trials every day,

680
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,100
but you also need to be in charge of
the 300 officials under you.

681
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,860
This is no joke.

682
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,910
Since I'm in charge of so many people,

683
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,950
Your Highness, you should treat me courteously.

684
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,340
I'm here to teach you.

685
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,580
Your Highness, are you saying that
you don't want to treat me courteously?

686
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,100
I guess so.

687
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,060
Courtesy is for strangers.

688
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,270
Intimacy is for lovers.

689
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,620
Your Highness, you're leaving already?

690
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,380
Let me see you off.

691
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,580
Take care. Be careful.

692
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,860
He's not taking the carriage?

693
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,910
Why?

694
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,140
Are you shy from my care for you?

695
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,820
Don't you think you went too far

696
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,580
to see me off?

697
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,620
I heard that our predecessors saw people off

698
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,060
by walking them to the suburbs.

699
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,580
Your Highness, why are you not feeling grateful

700
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,910
but complaining about it instead?

701
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,340
Although the Capital is a prosperous place,

702
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
don't you think it's overpopulated?

703
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,430
The metropolitan examination,

704
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,670
which is held once every three years, is coming soon.

705
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,620
Naturally, the big crowd.

706
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,580
Go away!

707
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,670
Get out of my way!

708
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,580
He's so arrogant!

709
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,100
Are you okay?

710
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,910
I'm fine.

711
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,870
How could he do that?

712
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,430
Do you even know how to ride a horse?

713
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,870
This is so inauspicious.

714
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,870
You're riding your horse recklessly
in a busy market!

715
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,140
This is no different from killing!

716
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
What if you crashed into someone?

717
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,870
You think your lot

718
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,430
[Gu Qishan, son of Marquis Zhongyi]
is worth killing by me?

719
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,180
You...

720
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,140
We're both promising examinees.

721
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
How could you be so rude?

722
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,870
Precisely.

723
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,580
I was wondering who you ignorant fools were

724
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,620
since you couldn't recognize me.

725
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,140
So you are just lowly scholars
from somewhere else.

726
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,580
Watch your manner! How could you say that?

727
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,540
Mind your words!

728
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,390
Ren Anle.

729
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,870
Your Highness, why are you stopping me

730
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,740
instead of him?

731
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,870
You just entered the Capital.
You mustn't make enemies.

732
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,510
The people are suffering

733
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,910
because of these rich and ignorant fools.

734
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,100
Do you want me to just stand idly by?

735
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,180
How could you do this?

736
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,620
Listen carefully.

737
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,910
I will definitely pass

738
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,100
the metropolitan examination this year.

739
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,100
Go ahead and brag.

740
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,140
You guys,

741
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,660
you guys,

742
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,830
and you guys,

743
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,740
it's difficult to make a living in the Capital.

744
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,510
I suggest you guys

745
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,260
flee back to your little homes!

746
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,310
You!

747
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,180
Stop right there!

748
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,100
Don't leave!

749
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,740
(What kind of person is that?)

750
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
(He's so rotten.)

751
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,870
Ren Anle.

752
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,870
(He was too arrogant.)

753
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,580
You command 30,000 naval soldiers.

754
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,060
You mustn't trip over at such a petty thing.

755
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,100
So, Your Highness, you do care about me after all.

756
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,990
Do you think we're the only ones
in this busy market?

757
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,700
Ren Anle!

758
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,510
Your Highness, I won't wash my face
for the entire month.

759
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,870
Ridiculous.

760
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,300
This is far enough.

761
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,580
Head back and memorize the scrolls.

762
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,990
Your Highness.

763
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,300
He's pretty daring.

764
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,990
Young Lady,

765
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,580
someone has been tailing us

766
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,950
for a long time.

767
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,220
Should I...

768
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,390
He's been tailing us since the hunting feast.

769
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,990
Crown Prince sent him to monitor you, Young Lady.

770
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,870
Just ignore him.

771
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
Since he wants to monitor me,

772
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,580
I'll grant him his wish.

773
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,390
Yuanshu, keep an eye on him.

774
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,220
Yuanqin,

775
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,990
let's head somewhere nice.

776
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,580
Okay.

777
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,800
[Crown Prince's Residence]

778
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,510
Your Highness,

779
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,300
it's not that your throwing skill
has deteriorated.

780
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,510
It's just

781
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,660
this jar is full.

782
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,700
There are 22 brushes inside.

783
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,550
The case I handled today

784
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,260
is the 23rd murder case I recorded.

785
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,830
Even this jar knows

786
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,740
that evil is pervasive and overflowing.

787
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,410
It can no longer be contained.

788
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,220
Marquis Zhongyi gets his way
by any means necessary.

789
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,390
We can't deal with him using ordinary methods.

790
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,910
As long as Marquis Zhongyi is around,

791
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,390
Jing State will not be at peace.

792
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,830
Your Highness!

793
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,260
Your Highness.

794
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,780
If so, let's see if the pawn you placed
in the Court of Judicial Review

795
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,300
is a good one

796
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,740
or a bad one.

797
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,950
Your Highness,

798
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,030
I've been following her for several days.

799
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,660
She has sent invitations
to all the third-rank officials and above

800
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,740
in the Capital.

801
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,740
Nothing seemed off about her schedule.

802
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,220
However,

803
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,100
she's at Lingxiang Pleasure House right now.

804
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,100
[Lingxiang Pleasure House]

805
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,870
You're here. Please come inside.

806
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,870
-Let's sit in front.
-Let's sit upstairs.

807
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,390
Okay.

808
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,350
It's full.

809
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,030
Let's go.

810
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,780
Is this the legendary Lingxiang Pleasure House?

811
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,990
Your Highness!

812
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,550
Your Highness!

813
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,990
I heard that this place

814
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,180
was famous for making wealthy people
squander their fortune.

815
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,030
You need plenty of money

816
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,700
just to enjoy their songs and have some tea here.

817
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,140
I heard that the best courtesan here, Linlang,

818
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,550
is known throughout the city.

819
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,180
However, not many people have seen her.

820
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,780
Your Highness,

821
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,390
look.

822
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,550
This place has actually set up a bet

823
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,180
of you and Ren Anle.

824
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,180
Everyone,

825
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,780

To my right

828
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,510
[Ren Anle]
is Official Ren Anle.

829
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,580
Will Official Ren become the Crown Princess?

830
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,830
Let's make a bet today.

831
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,990
Are you guys making a bet on me?

832
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,030
Isn't that Official Ren?

833
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,030
Could it be that you're the legendary...

834
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,950
That's right.

835
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,700
Since you want to bet on me,

836
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,950
you have to know

837
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,660
what I look like.

838
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,910
Guys, remember to bet on me.

839
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,780
(Ridiculous.)

840
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,580
Order them to cancel the bet immediately.

841
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,180
Your Highness, please don't.

842
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,700
At least it's half about you.

843
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,470
And if they find that you're also here,

844
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,580
it'll only end up garnering more attention.

845
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,580
Everyone, remember to bet on me.

846
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,180
Wait.

847
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,390
Official Luo?

848
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,870
What...

849
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,260
Official Luo.

850
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,950
Official Luo looked so desireless.

851
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,740
What a surprise

852
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,700
to see him here.

853
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,870
More than that, he's a regular.

854
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,780
Really?

855
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,740
Official Luo often comes here
and pretends to drink.

856
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,100
But he'll arrest the suspect
before anyone knows it.

857
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,100
The person in charge is so afraid of him.

858
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,660
We're simply betting for fun.

859
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,390
Please don't arrest us for this.

860
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,910
Who said I was going to do that?

861
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,830
This concerns the Crown Prince's marriage.

862
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm here to join you for the fun.

863
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,700
Change this

864
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,580
into chips.

865
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,700
Yes, My Lord.

866
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,780
Official Luo,

867
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,950
please have fun to the fullest.

nice to meet you.

874
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,780
I didn't expect you

875
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,260
to be so good-looking, too.

876
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,030
But speaking of which, Official Luo,

877
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,870
you're the first person

878
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,470
who dares to join this bet.

879
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,740
You're pretty daring.

880
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,780
I admire your bravery.

881
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,260
You're also the first person

882
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,220
in the Capital to treat me with such rudeness.

883
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,100
Shall we continue?

884
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,830
Naturally, I will bet that
I can become the Crown Princess.

885
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,260
If so, I'll bet

886
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,220
that you cannot become the Crown Princess.

887
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,470
Your Highness,

888
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,510
both Official Ren and Official Luo

889
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,100
are in red.

890
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,550
They look like

891
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,990
a pair of newlyweds.

892
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,180
Guys, remember to bet on me.

893
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,740
Bet on Ren Anle.

894
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,910
Come here.

895
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,740
Come on, don't be shy.

896
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,950
I'll make a bet.

897
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,180
I think Miss Ren has a huge chance of winning.

898
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,030
Did you guys hear that?

899
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,780
Come here, don't be shy.

900
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,910
Buddies, come here.

901
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,700
Come to me.

902
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,620
You guys...

903
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,100
You guys are going overboard here.

904
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,300
This is too much.

905
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,510
I told you to place your bet here.

906
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,260
Can't you see me?

907
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,870
Ren Anle.

908
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,780
Just give up.

909
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,220
No way.

910
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,390
Your Highness, what about this?

911
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,030
Let's make our own bet.

912
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,180
Between you and Ren Anle,

913
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,580
who do you think will win?

914
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,470
Di Ziyuan will win.

915
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,030
This is no fun.

916
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,990
