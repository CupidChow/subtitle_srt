00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,020
Luckily, Ren Anle saved me.

191
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,620
It was a close shave.

192
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,140
Han Ye.

193
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,140
You're the Crown Prince.

194
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,500
Do you even know your identity?

195
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,140
It's just Zhong Hai.

196
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,260
You don't need to capture him

197
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,500
personally.

198
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,780
You're the Crown Prince of Jing.

199
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,620
The Emperor's son.

200
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,900
Don't place yourself in danger.
It's as simple as that.

201
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,020
Don't you understand?

202
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,900
I already reminded you

203
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,780
during Jiangnan's disaster relief mission.

204
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,900
Your safety

205
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,140
concerns the entire Jing State.

206
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
You have to be prudent.

207
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,140
Don't tell me

208
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
you forgot everything I said.

209
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,380
I know my fault.

210
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,620
Han Ye.

211
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,900
You're the Crown Prince.

212
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm old now.

213
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,100
I don't want you

214
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,500
to depart from this world

215
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,100
before me.

216
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,980
Sorry, Father.

217
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,500
An assassin!

218
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,500
Protect His Majesty!

219
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,380
Protect His Majesty!

220
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,620
Yes!

221
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,620
Send the Empress Dowager back to Jingxin Hall.

222
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,380
Cheng'en,

223
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,620
leave with Grandmother.

224
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,260
(This is bad.)

225
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
(I entered the palace in a hurry.)

226
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,780
(Lengbei isn't with me.)

227
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,980
Look after the Empress Dowager. Hurry!

228
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,980
Cheng'en, stay here.

229
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,380
Retreat.

230
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,500
Go.

231
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,980
Notify the Imperial Bodyguards
to protect His Majesty.

232
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,980
Yes, Your Highness.

233
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,500
Your Majesty, be careful!

234
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,260
Ziyuan!

235
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,500
Ziyuan!

236
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,500
Ziyuan!

237
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,380
Ziyuan!

238
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,660
After him!

239
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,140
Stop right there.

240
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,780
Hurry!

241
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,260
Crown Prince,

242
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,500
stop pursuing him.

243
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,380
Summon the imperial physician.

244
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,020
Now!

245
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,900
Hurry.

246
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,100
How is it?

247
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,500
Is it serious?

248
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Your Highness,

249
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,220
although Miss Di suffered

250
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,740
a serious blow,

251
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,260
her life isn't in danger now.

252
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,900
She just needs to rest and recuperate.

253
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,900
Good.

254
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,500
Luckily, her vital organs weren't damaged.

255
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,140
Your Highness,

256
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,260
it's getting late.

257
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,500
Since the imperial physician said
Miss Di is fine now,

258
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,500
why don't we

259
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,260
head back and rest?

260
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,860
Cheng'en was seriously wounded
because she defended His Majesty.

261
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,420
I will wait here

262
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,900
until she wakes up.

263
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,500
Crown Prince,

264
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,020
the palace servants will look after her.

265
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,860
You have more important things to do.

266
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

267
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,380
All of you may leave.

268
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

269
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,500
That was a huge incident.

270
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,020
There were actually assassins in the palace.

271
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,220
I never expected the security here

272
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,260
to become this lax.

273
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,780
Your Majesty, please be appeased.

274
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,620
You have to get to the bottom of this.

275
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,500
I've already sent my men to investigate the case.

276
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,620
I will never let them off

277
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,340
for trying to harm you.

278
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
You may investigate the case.

279
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,620
However,

280
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,100
do not put yourself in danger.

281
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,620
You must remember my words.

282
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,780
I will.

283
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
I never expected her

284
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,260
to block the blow for me.

285
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,220
Your Majesty,

286
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
regarding the blow Ziyuan blocked for you...

287
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,380
I know what you're trying to say.

288
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,900
The Di and Han families founded
the Jing State together many years ago.

289
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,020
However,

290
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,380
the empire of Jing

291
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,900
has nothing to do with the Di family now.

292
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
Even so,

293
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,780
I never expected the daughter of the Di family

294
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,780
to save my life tonight.

295
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,260
Maybe the marriage alliance
between the Han and Di families

296
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,620
was destined.

297
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,820
Thank you,

298
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,780
Your Majesty.

299
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,860
Your wish

300
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,660
has finally been fulfilled.

301
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,500
Is thank you the only thing you can say?

302
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,780
Crown Prince,

303
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,820
some things

304
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,300
have already changed.

305
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,260
It's just

306
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,300
that you have no idea.

307
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,260
Anning,

308
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
you must be exhausted too.

309
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,780
You should head back and rest.

310
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,300
[Ren's Residence]

311
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,780
Ziyuan, you're awake.

312
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,500
You're still here?

313
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,220
I dared not leave as I was afraid

314
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,940
that your condition might worsen.

315
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,020
Thank you, Mingxi.

316
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,820
Thank you for staying by my side.

317
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,900
But you mustn't act recklessly in the future.

318
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,980
You have to notify me in advance
before you do anything.

319
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,300
What happened today

320
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,020
was too sudden.

321
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,860
I had no time to notify you.

322
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,020
Besides,

323
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,740
you've already done enough for me.

324
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,500
I didn't want you to be worried about me again.

325
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,300
However, if taking this path

326
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,020
means that you'll be sacrificed,

327
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,660
I'd rather let my ten-year effort
go down the drain.

328
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,060
I understand now.

329
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,820
I won't act recklessly again.

330
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,980
But speaking of which,

331
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,580
not only did you miss out

332
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,500
on the fireworks,

333
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,140
but you also missed out on a good show.

334
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,780
There were assassins

335
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,500
trying to assassinate Han Zhongyuan.

336
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,500
Di Cheng'en blocked a blow for him.

337
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
So, Di Cheng'en is...

338
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,500
Di Cheng'en is fine.

339
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,460
But after this incident,

340
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,010
I'm afraid the Crown Princess
has already been decided.

341
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
If that's the case,

342
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,740
our opportunity is at hand.

343
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
It's almost dawn.

344
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,220
The palace banquet is almost over.

345
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
It's time

346
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,780
to extinguish the fire.

347
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,260
Aren't you upset?

348
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,660
I'm upset about the truth
that hasn't been revealed

349
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,980
and those who suffered wrongful deaths.

350
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,260
All right.

351
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,060
Looks like the vengeful Ren Anle

352
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,740
has finally returned.

353
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,780
How did the assassins appear inside the palace?

354
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,300
Your Majesty,

355
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,740
the assassins we hired

356
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,780
were going to kill Di Cheng'en
on her way back to her residence.

357
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,060
The assassins in the palace

358
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,780
have nothing to do with us.

359
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,740
Why is there another group of assassins?

360
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,940
Also, why were they targeting the Emperor?

361
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,020
Say, do you think the Emperor

362
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,000
will find out that the assassins are hired by me?

363
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Your Majesty,

364
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,540
you lead a reclusive life.

365
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,500
Why would you be related to the assassins?

366
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,300
You're right.

367
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,020
I'm muddle-headed.

368
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,780
I don't know who they are.

369
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,180
Now that it has come to this,

370
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,260
I'm afraid

371
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,820
you have no way to get rid of Di Cheng'en.

372
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,820
I know that.

373
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,180
It's fine if the Crown Prince was the only one

374
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,260
being insistent.

375
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
But this time,

376
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,380
she has saved the Emperor.

377
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,500
Her merit is akin

378
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,500
to an appointment by an imperial decree.

379
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,820
Somehow,

380
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,500
everything is happening in her favor.

381
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,500
If so, we shall let her live for a few more days.

382
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,060
Have you found out the cause?

383
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,020
What's with the fire

384
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,380
on Wuliu Street?

385
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,700
It seems like it was related to Marquis Zhongyi.

386
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,620
I heard that he also sent his men
to capture Zhong Hai.

387
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,100
Official Ren was trapped in the fire.

388
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,780
That's why His Highness rushed inside to save her.

389
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,940
Marquis Zhongyi again?

390
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,660
Your Majesty, please be appeased.

391
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,780
Fortunately, His Highness is safe.

392
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,780
The fire on Wuliu Street

393
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,660
was a close shave.

394
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,780
Wuliu Street.

395
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,940
It's Wuliu Street again.

396
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,460
The Crown Prince was there to save someone,

397
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,660
but he said he was saved by someone else.

398
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,460
Zhao Fu,

399
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,740
tell me.

400
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,980
Is he just too benevolent?

401
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,460
Or does he have something for Ren Anle?

402
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,940
Maybe both.

403
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,420
Now that the Crown Princess has been decided,

404
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,500
he and Official Ren still have to...

405
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,940
Forget it.

406
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,260
Send some rewards to Ren's Residence.

407
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,820
Reward Ren Anle for saving the Crown Prince.

408
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,140
By the way,

410
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,300
Official Luo

411
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,300
also went to Wuliu Street.

412
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,060
Although he didn't enter the fire scene,

413
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,420
he did

414
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,820
take Zhong Hai away.

415
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,820
Now that Zhong Hai is in Luo Mingxi's hand,

416
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,020
it's no longer under the table.

417
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,820
Marquis Zhongyi

418
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,540
will keep himself in check more or less.

419
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

420
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,870
[Residence of the Princess]

421
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,540
(Wait.)

422
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,660
(Lengbei isn't here?)

423
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,780
(Where did he go?)

424
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,060
Lengbei,

425
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
you better don't disappoint me.

426
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,820
Why?

427
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,620
Why did she try to save Zhong Hai?

428
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,740
Your Highness.

429
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,140
You're awake.

430
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,380
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

431
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,580
His Majesty...

432
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,020
How is His Majesty?

433
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,540
His Majesty is fine

434
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,140
all thanks to you.

435
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,260
Your Highness, what have I done

436
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,780
to deserve your kindness?

437
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,540
You're my family's benefactor.

438
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,900
It's my duty to take care of you.

439
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,220
So, Your Highness,

440
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,540
am I

441
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,900
just your benefactor?

442
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,460
No matter who you are to me,

443
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,700
Di Ziyuan

444
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,620
will become the Crown Princess of Jing.

445
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,740
His Majesty has already agreed to it.

446
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
You don't need to worry.

447
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,780
His Majesty already agreed to our marriage?

448
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,500
Your Highness,

449
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,300
aren't you glad?

450
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,020
I have something else to attend to.

451
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
You should rest well.

452
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,540
Your Highness...

453
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,070
[Residence of the Princess]

454
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,460
Lengbei.

455
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,300
Where were you last night?

456
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,980
I...

457
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,740
Last night, I...

458
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,740
Anning.

459
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,220
Anning.

460
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,060
Mo Shuang.

461
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,460
Don't blame Lengbei.

462
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,980
It's all because of me.

463
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,980
You?

464
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,980
I was assaulted by some crooks

465
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,220
on my way back to Sifang House.

466
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,980
Luckily, Lengbei was there.

467
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,100
He chased away the crooks for me.

468
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,340
Is she speaking the truth?

469
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,340
Of course.

470
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,300
Anning,

471
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,340
you should reward Lengbei

472
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
for his heroic deeds.

473
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,460
By the way, Anning,

474
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,700
did something happen
during the palace banquet last night?

475
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,980
Were you hurt?

476
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,300
Why would I be hurt?

477
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,740
You should worry about yourself.

478
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,020
Are you okay?

479
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,340
I...

480
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,460
Who bullied you last night?

481
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,460
I'll make them pay.

482
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
I'm fine.

483
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,780
It was just some hooligans.

484
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,980
Lengbei already

485
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,500
taught them a lesson for me.

486
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,460
Anning,

487
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,220
if you're truly worried about me,

488
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,300
why don't you

489
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,900
teach me some self-defense skills?

490
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,500
Why don't you teach me now?

491
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,540
(Lengbei,)

492
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,860
don't attempt

493
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,700
such a dangerous act again,

494
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,740
okay?

495
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm fine.

496
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,780
By the way,

497
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,820
tomorrow,

498
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,540
come with me to the Residence of the Princess.

499
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,060
Tell Anning

500
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,220
that you were assaulted by some crooks

501
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,020
on your way to Sifang House tonight.

502
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,900
Tell her that I chased them away for you.

503
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,750
[Crown Prince's Residence]

504
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,300
Your Highness,

505
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,900
you're treasuring
this weiqi piece of yours so much.

506
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,700
I guess it's a beautiful memory for you.

507
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,380
It's just that...

508
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,460
Cut to the chase.

509
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,700
Zhong Hai, whom you guys
are investigating right now,

510
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,900
I met him before.

511
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,780
When I was in Jiangnan,

512
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,540
I saw Yuanshu and Yuanqin

513
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,540
holding a portrait in their hands.
They were looking for an elder brother.

514
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,580
According to my photographic memory,

515
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,380
I'm sure

516
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,820
that Zhong Hai

517
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,900
was the person in the portrait.

518
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,820
Zhong Hai is unlucky indeed.

519
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,780
Not only did he have such a boorish sister,

520
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,140
but he also

521
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,620
had to experience such...

522
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,900
Your Highness.

523
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,060
I'm not done yet.

524
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,120
[Residence of the Princess]

525
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,740
Lengbei,

526
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,380
why did you have to attempt such a risky move?

527
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,500
What does Father want you to do?

528
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,300
I told you before.

529
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Stay out of this.

530
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,300
Don't worry.

531
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,460
I didn't intend to hurt anyone last night.

532
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,500
Fine then.

533
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,620
I don't understand you guys at all.

534
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,460
Mo Shuang,

535
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,020
this place isn't safe.

536
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Forget about being the Crown Princess.

537
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,060
You dressed yourself in a style

538
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,220
that the Crown Prince liked during the banquet.

539
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,060
But has he ever paid any attention to you?

540
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,220
I already got my thoughts straight long ago.

541
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
You see,

542
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,700
when it comes to sword dancing,

543
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,100
I'm no match for Anle.

544
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,980
When it comes to love,

545
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,700
I'm no match for Cheng'en.

546
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,820
It's indeed hard

547
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,060
to be the Crown Princess.

548
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm glad that you know that.

549
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,700
Don't do such silly things again.

550
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,220
When you're free,

551
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,900
you should visit our residence more often.

552
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,580
Make friends with Princess Anning

553
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,220
and make her happy.

554
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,900
Lengbei, you're so thoughtful.

555
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,060
You're so nice to Princess Anning.

556
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,700
Judging from our current circumstances,

557
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,580
there's no harm in making her happy.

558
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,580
I'll be counting on you.

559
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,740
All right.

560
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,100
I'll stop here.

561
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,060
Princess Anning is in a bad mood.

562
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,700
-If she finds out...
-All right now.

563
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,460
You should go back and keep her company.

564
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,100
I'll make a move first.

00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,350
[Ren's Residence]

566
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,780
Your Highness?

567
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,980
Your Highness, what's with the sudden visit?

568
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,700
You were seriously wounded.

569
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,980
I was worried about you.

570
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,460
How are you?

571
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,700
It's just a minor injury.

572
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,980
I'm fine.

573
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,700
You knew it was dangerous.

574
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,380
Why did you risk your life to save Zhong Hai?

575
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,860
Your Highness,
you risked your life to save me too.

576
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,980
By the way,

577
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,820
I left in a hurry back then.

578
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,700
I didn't get the chance to express my thanks,
Your Highness.

579
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,220
Spare the formalities.

580
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,580
Sit down.

581
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,580
It was a life-or-death situation.

582
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,900
I would save the one in the fire

583
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,980
no matter who it was.

584
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,500
It's the same for me toward Zhong Hai.

585
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,020
What is this?

586
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,140
The eunuch who delivered them said

587
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,500
His Majesty rewarded me with these

588
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,220
because I saved you, Your Highness.

589
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,380
But you were the one who saved me.

590
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,100
Why is the story different?

591
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,620
However,

592
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,860
Your Highness, I still need to thank you

593
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,220
for saving me from His Majesty's lecture.

594
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,140
You've done a lot for me before this.

595
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,220
You deserve to have these.

596
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,220
However, people in the palace

597
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,980
always beat around the bush.

598
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,580
I will never understand
what you guys are trying to get at.

599
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,100
His Majesty only granted you a scabbard

600
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,140
without a sword.

601
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,500
That's right.

602
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,860
I think His Majesty wants me

603
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,620
to retract my edge, huh?

604
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,740
Don't mind him.

605
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,220
If you do retract your edge,

606
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,100
you will no longer be

607
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,380
the one and only Ren Anle.

608
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,980
However, I'm still worried about Zhong Hai.

609
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,220
Although he managed to escape death,

610
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,860
Marquis Zhongyi will still try to track him down.

611
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,300
Don't worry.

612
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,980
I will supervise this case

613
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,500
and make sure he's safe.

615
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Where did you come from?

616
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,380
What's your name?

617
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,100
I'm just a nobody.

618
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,340
Sir, there's no need to know who I am.

619
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,820
If so, do you know

620
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,340
who tried to kill you?

621
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,740
I don't know.

622
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,780
If so, why did you come all the way

623
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,340
to the capital?

624
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,820
I know who you are even if you don't tell me.

625
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,300
Your name is Zhong Hai.

626
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,220
You came to the capital

627
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,300
to redress grievances for the Zhong family.

628
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,980
However,

629
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,100
as long as you tell me the truth,

630
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,820
I can help you out.

633
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,820
Bring me to him.

634
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,700
You have to address me as Official Luo here.

639
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,300
I'll leave Zhong Hai to you.

640
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,300
He has a lot of secrets.

641
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,140
You have to interrogate him well.

642
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,020
Don't worry.

643
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,820
Since Ren Anle risked her life to save him,

644
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,500
I will definitely do my best.

645
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,780

Please uphold justice for the Zhong family,

I know the evil deeds Marquis Zhongyi and his son

656

have committed.

657
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,980
Although his family is dignified and renowned,

658
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
he disregards the law
and commits all kinds of evil crimes.

659
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,420
Not only will I hear about your grievances,

660

663
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,420
means that you have to suffer,

00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,020
don't worry about your limited power
and presence.

to save you from the fire.

680
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,020
I assume she felt frustrated

681
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,460
about the Zhong family's grievances too.

00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,500
Please preserve order

750
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,420
and reveal the truth!

751
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,780
I thought Gu Qishan was already banished?

752
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,940
That's right.

753
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,420
I thought...

754
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,260
Yeah.

755
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,340
Investigate Marquis Zhongyi!

756
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
Redress grievances for the Zhong family!

757
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,460
Investigate Marquis Zhongyi!

758
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,620
Redress grievances for the Zhong family!

759
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,940
Gu Qishan fled to avoid punishment.

760
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,820
And he has committed various crimes.

761
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,820
With my position on the line,

762
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,980
I, Huang Pu, will guarantee

763
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,820
that I will act impartially.

764
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,020
I will definitely uphold justice

765
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,300
for the Zhong family.

766
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,820
Thank you, sir.

767
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,450
[Marquis Zhongyi's Residence]

768
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,300
My Lord?

769
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,780
My Lord.

770
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,940
What did His Majesty say?

771
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,140
Father?

772
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,820
Father!

773
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,780
Father, say something.

774
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,740
Someone.

775
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,420
Send my son out of the city.

776
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:47,940
Yes, My Lord.

777
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,100
Father,

778
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,620
why are you chasing me away?

779
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,300
Wait!

780
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,740
Wait!

781
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,020
What are you doing?

782
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,420
My Lord, please make yourself clear!

783
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,940
What exactly did His Majesty say?

784
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,100
I didn't even get to see His Majesty.

785
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,140
How would I know what he had to say?

786
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,780
Father,

787
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,180
you're Marquis Zhongyi.

788
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,180
His Majesty will definitely forgive us.

789
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,420
You should beg him again.

790
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,940
Beg him?

791
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,420
How?

792
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,300
I already knelt

793
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,740
one day and one night in front of his chamber.

794
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,820
It didn't work.

795
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:26,940
My Lord,

796
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,820
you should beg His Majesty again.

797
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,100
That's right.

798
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,180
Father.

799
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,140
Shan,

800
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,300
it's not that I don't want to save you.

801
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,900
But this time, I cannot save you.

802
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,900
You should leave the city

803
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,420
and lay low for now.

804
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,700
Father!

805
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,660
Send him out of the city!

806
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,820
Father, I'm not leaving!

807
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,180
Young Master.

808
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,340
-I'm not leaving.
-Young Master!

809
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,460
Father!

810
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,100
Young Master, let's go.

811
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
I'm not leaving!

812
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,660
-Mother!
-Qishan!

813
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,220
-Mother, say something.
-Qishan!

814
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,860
Qishan!
