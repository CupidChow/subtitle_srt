The Founding Emperor

86
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,980
had appointed you as the Crown Princess.

88
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540

even if he had fallen in love with someone else.

94
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,500
Crown Prince, do you even remember

95
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,700
what I've told you?

96
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,540
Your Majesty.

97
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,820
-Grandmother.
-Empress Dowager.

98
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,420
I remember that you've always taught me

99
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,860
that whatever is spoken

100
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
must be honored with actions.

101
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,380
As the Crown Prince of Jing,

102
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
I have to lead by example.

103
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,940
I once said

104
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,820
that only Di Cheng'en will be the Crown Princess,

105
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,380
and this is the time for me to honor this promise.

106
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,420
You do remember
that you are the Crown Prince of Jing.

107
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,260
Then, do you remember
that she is the daughter of a traitor?

108
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,980
The Di family's crimes

109
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,260
have nothing to do with Cheng'en.

110
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,660
Moreover, she has been imprisoned
in Dai Mountain

111
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,820
for ten years.

112
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,980
Now, she's heeded the Emperor's orders
and changed her name to Cheng'en.

113
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,020
Grandmother, no matter what,

114
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,260
you shouldn't blame her
for what happened ten years ago.

115
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,980
You pretend to be subservient to me

116
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,340
while you play out your schemes here

117
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,420
and bewitch the Crown Prince.

118
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,340
You're from the Di family all right.

119
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,340
Emperor.

120
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,980
Give the order

121
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,100
and throw this vixen
out of the Crown Prince's Residence!

122
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,300
It was my wish to make Cheng'en

123
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,100
the Crown Princess,

124
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,340
and it's stated in the Founding Emperor's will.

125
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,220
I do not understand why you keep
objecting to this decision.

126
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,860
How dare you mention
the Founding Emperor and break my heart

127
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,580
just to protect the daughter of a traitor.

128
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,820
Emperor.

129
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,940
This is the Crown Prince you've raised.

130
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,100
Mother.

131
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,980
Calm down.

132
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,540
I heard that when Di Cheng'en was in Dai Mountain,

133
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,980
she transcribed Buddhist sutras every day

134
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,300
to pray for both of us.

135
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,540
Since she returned to the capital,
she has been obedient and respectful.

136
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,540
Perhaps she is not as you thought...

137
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,300
Emperor.

138
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,420
Have you also forgotten the past as well?

139
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,900
Have you been bewitched

140
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,100
by this Di woman's lies too?

141
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,220
My opinion is that the Crown Prince has grown up,

142
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,220
and he knows who he wants

143
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,660
to be his Crown Princess.

144
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,980
As his elders,

145
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,980
we should not interfere too much.

146
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,100
You...

147
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,780
All of you.

148
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,540
You may continue this folly,

149
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,500
but as long as I am the Empress Dowager of Jing,

150
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
this Di woman

151
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,860
will never enter the Crown Prince's Residence.

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,380
It's because of my late father.

184
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,500
When Han Ye held the hairpin in his hand,

185
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,660
I was actually hoping

186
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,780
that he would put it on my head.

187
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,740
What was I thinking?

188
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,860
That hairpin belongs to the Han family.

189
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,340
Ziyuan.

190
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,100
I believe the late Marquis

191
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,780
would understand the dilemma you're facing.

192
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,900
I'd like to take a stroll
in the former Marquis's residence.

193
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,220
I'll come with you.

194
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,700
No need.

195
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,460
There are some things

196
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,580
that I want to tell my father alone.

197
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,940
Very well.

205

206
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,100
It's snowing heavily.

207
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,340
When we wake up tomorrow,

208
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,900
the capital will be covered in white,

209
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,700
leaving not even the slightest trace.

210
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,660
If the snow were any heavier,

211
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,700
do you think it can cover the bloodstains
in the Residence of Marquis Jing'an?

212
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,780
I only know

213
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,380
that if the snow keeps falling,

214
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,340
you're going to fall sick.

215
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,660
Go back to your room.

216
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,780
That Di woman is scheming her way
to become the Crown Princess.

217
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,580
She must be plotting
to restore her family's power.

218
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,340
Di Cheng'en is joining
the Crown Princess selection

219
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,700
firstly because the Crown Prince

220
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,220
insists on following
the Founding Emperor's will,

221
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,540
and secondly,

222
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,780
as his father,

223
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,820
I tried my best

224
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,460
but still couldn't persuade him

225
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,100
to abandon her and select someone else.

226
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,220
I had no choice

227
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,540
but to let her return.

228
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,220
Still, Mother, do not worry.

229
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,100
If she's plotting something,

230
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,100
I'll take this opportunity

231
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,980
to eradicate the Di family once and for all.

232
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,660
However, if she's truly loyal to us,

233
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,660
she would prove much use

234
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,820
to us.

235
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Years ago, Di Yongning killed himself

236
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,900
without admitting his family's
treacherous ambitions

237
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,780
to everyone in the nation.

238
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,220
Even now,

239
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,140
there are still people

240
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,980
who doubt the crimes of the Di family.

241
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,140
That's why

242
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,660
I exiled the Di orphan to Dai Mountain

243
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,460
so that she would

244
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,580
swear her loyalty

245
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,460
and her family's

246
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,220
to me.

247
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,780
If Di Cheng'en becomes the Crown Princess,

248
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,700
to the Crown Prince,

249
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,580
he is merely honoring

250
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,900
the Founding Emperor's will.

251
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,580
However,

252
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,260
to me,

253
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,420
she is the key to taming the Di family

254
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,500
and will be my secret weapon.

257
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,180
Stand right there.

258

260
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,740
Do you know how much trouble I've gone through

261
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,020
to transfer you from the Northwest to Jiangnan?

262
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,900
Why have you run away and come back?

263
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,060
Speak.

264
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,260
Did you get yourself into trouble again?

265
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,020
No.

266
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,180
I didn't.

267
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,540
It's just that I missed you...

268
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,820
Cut that out!

269
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,140
If you don't tell me now,

270
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,300
no one will help you
when someone else discovers it.

272
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,660
I was wrong.

273
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
I was wrong.

274
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,860
Please help me.

275
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,580
Only you can help me now, Father.

276
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,700
What happened?

277
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,940

My Lord.

280
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,900
After the Young Marquis arrived in Jiangnan,

281
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,420
he drank, raped, and killed the eldest daughter
of the Zhong family, Zhong Jing.

282
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,540
Then, he tried to burn down the crime scene,

283
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,260
but he

284
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,420
accidentally

285
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,180
set fire to the entire residence
and killed everyone inside.

287
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,940
Please help me!

288
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,660

00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,540
Help you?

290
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,660

294
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,020
It's impossible to conceal the crime now,

295
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,420
so why don't we

296
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,780
get a scapegoat instead?

297
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,820

(I'm back.)

306
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,860
(But in this huge residence,)

307
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,820
(I'm all alone here.)

308
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,820
(The 80,000 men who died
at the foot of Qingnan Mountain)

(remain disgraced since ten years ago till now)

310
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,260
(because of false accusations,)

311
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,380
(and their bodies could not be sent home.)

312
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,620
(Back then, you killed yourself
to prove your innocence,)

313
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,980
(but no one did you justice.)

314

(Now, the person who incriminated us)

315
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,020
(is sitting on the throne,)

316

(enjoying the power he wields over the people)

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,860

319
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
I will do our family justice.

320
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,860
I will make the Han family

321
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,100
admit their crimes in front of the people

322
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,220
so that our 80,000 men

323
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,860
can rest in peace.

324
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,100
My will is determined.

325
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,140

What are you doing here?

328
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I heard the Crown Princess selection banquet
was held on the day Marquis Jing'an died.

329
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,900
It gave me much to think about.

330
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,100
Marquis Jing'an was a legend among the people.

331
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,140
I had never seen his heroic deeds
while he was alive,

332
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,140
but paying my respects here today

333
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,980
is a way to express my admiration.

334
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,140
A legend?

335
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,980
Yes.

336
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,220
The Di troops were known for their bravery,

337
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,460
yet they were exterminated overnight.

338
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,700
As their general, Marquis Jing'an

339
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,980
didn't expect that after he killed himself,

340
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,100
his whole family would be eradicated as well.

341
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,980
There are many theories

342
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,740
as to what happened that night.

343
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,740
I'm interested in such legends.

344
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,100
A hero was forced to die to prove his innocence.

345
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,780
80,000 men from the Di troops died in the wild.

346
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,740
How tragic

347
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,220
and cruel it was.

348
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,740
Yet, their sacrifice is summarized
by a mere word, "legend",

than an after-dinner story.

about the details of what happened,

353
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,580
but since you still remember Marquis Jing'an,

354
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,620
that means he's not truly dead.

355
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,340
I shall not disturb you
from remembering the dead.

how the Crown Prince

protected me that night?

364
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,620
he stood in front of me to defend me.

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
you don't have to be

367
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,020
as cautious as you were.

368
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,540
It's also time for you

369
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,860
to visit the Residence of Marquis Jing'an.

370
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,820
I'm not going.

371
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,220
Even though

372
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,780
I won the Crown Prince's heart
during the banquet,

373
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,340
I made a lot of enemies as well.

374
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,340
If I pay my respects
at the Residence of Marquis Jing'an,

375
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,700
people would use this to thwart my position.

376
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,460
But don't forget

377
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,580
that the Crown Prince is just in love

378
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,780
with your current identity as Di Ziyuan.

379
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,260
But the Empress Dowager and the Emperor

380
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,340
despise me as Di Ziyuan too.

381
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,580
If I pay my respects there now,

382
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,820
I would incur their wrath.

383
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,340
Mu Qing.

384
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,100
You didn't see

385
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,940
how scary the Empress Dowager's eyes
were last night.

386
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,820
Had the Crown Prince not stood before me,

387
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,940
she would have...

388
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,340
She would have killed me right there.

389
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,460
But the Crown Prince said

390
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,580
that he would wait for you
at the Marquis's residence.

391
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
If you don't go,

392
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,060
you'd risk exposing yourself.

393
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,340
I'm not going.

394
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,700
The Crown Prince would see it

395
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,820
as my way of protecting myself,

396
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,340
and he would be even more protective of me.

397
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,060
Since the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages,

398
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,180
why should I go?

399
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,980
I'm just worried that the Crown Prince
would get suspicious.

400
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,660
Mu Qing.

401
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
I know

402
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,580
you want the best for me.

403
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,700
But you didn't see

404
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,820
how the Crown Prince looked at me

405
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,860
when he stood in front of me.

406
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,220
He was so determined.

407
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,780
I believe

408
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,700
he wouldn't abandon me.

409
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,420
Ye.

410
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,340
The Residence of Marquis Jing'an
has been left in ruins for years.

411
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,820
It's impossible for me
to clear up everything overnight.

412
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,340
Didn't Ziyuan come with you?

413
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,340
She's probably still feeling ill,

414
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,860
so she's not here now.

415
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,580
Why deceive yourself?

416
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,660
You and I know

417
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,340
that she's trying to protect herself

418
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,940
so that she can become the Crown Princess safely.

419
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,300
Anning.

420
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Don't blame her.

421
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,820
Grandmother did mistreat her before this,

422
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,300
so it's only normal

423
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,100
that she's not coming.

424
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,660
I'm not blaming her.

425
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,980
I'm just resenting myself

426
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,060
while feeling sorry

427
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,980
for the Marquis and the Di troops.

428
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,700
A hero who founded the nation

429
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,860
couldn't even

430
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,580
have his own daughter come to pay her respects.

431
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,180
Both Marquis Jing'an and the Di troops

432
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,460
fought for the nation.

433
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,220
They are all heroes.

434
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,460
However, the tragedy ten years ago happened

435
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,700
because the Di family committed treason.

436
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,340
Anning.

437
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,980
You were still young back then,

438
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,940
and you were innocent.

439
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,940
You shouldn't be

440
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,780
bearing the blame.

441
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,460
I am not innocent at all.

442
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,060
The most innocent one is Ziyuan.

443
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,060
If it weren't for the tragedy ten years ago,

444
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,820
Ziyuan wouldn't have turned into Cheng'en today,

445
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,180
unable and scared of paying respects

446
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,060
to her own father.

447
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,180
Ye.

448
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,940
The Han family ruined Ziyuan.

449
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,460
After being imprisoned in Dai Mountain
for ten years,

450
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,580
she has become

451
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,100
a completely different person.

452
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,340
I also miss

453
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,660
the Ziyuan from the past.

454
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,580
Yes.

455
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,460
I also miss

456
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,180
the old Ziyuan.

457
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,660
Even though Ziyuan isn't coming,

458
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,100
I met someone else earlier.

459
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,220
Was Luo Mingxi here?

460
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,580
It's Anle.

461
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,300
You know

462
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,220
what was on my mind when I saw her?

463
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,220
I was thinking

464
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,820
that if Ziyuan wasn't sent to Dai Mountain,

465
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,700
she might have grown into

466
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,460
a free-spirited woman

467
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,180
who can travel all over the world.

468
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Ren Anle.

469
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,020
[Ren's Residence]

470
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,780
Now that you've paid your respects,

471
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,540
do you feel calmer?

472
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,780
The Di family is in an abject state now.

473
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,300
Only I can restore justice to my family.

474
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,940
That means I have to get rid
of unnecessary thoughts

475
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,260
to take my revenge.

476
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,660
By "unnecessary thoughts",

477
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,140
you mean Han Ye, don't you?

478
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,140
Yes.

479
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,140
I cannot lie to myself

480
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,220
that everything I said last night

481
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,900
was just the wine talking.

482
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,060
I have indeed

483
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,660
fallen for Han Ye.

484
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,260
But I also know

485
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,820
that compared to my emotions,

486
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,420
the 80,000 lives of the Di troops matter more.

487
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,900
That's why

488
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,340
I won't let myself

489
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,500
indulge in these emotions anymore.

490
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,780
Whether it's sincere or fake,

491
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,300
I'm going to be myself again.

492
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,420
Ziyuan.

493
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,140
You can always show

494
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,020
your truest self in front of me.

495
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,300
Throughout all these years of acting as Ren Anle,

496
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,300
I can only feel relaxed and free

497
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,500
in front of you.

498
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,380
When I went to pay my respects,

499
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,660
Anning was there too.

500
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,380
Anning?

501
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,140
You didn't expose yourself, did you?

502
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Anning used to be naive and straightforward.

503
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,940
However, for some reason, I feel

504
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,020
that she's now

505
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,620
becoming sensitive.

506
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,380
I'll look into this.

507
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,020
But just seeing you paying your respects

508
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,300
shouldn't make her suspect your identity.

509
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
Another thing.

510
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,300
The Zhong's familicide

511
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,780
is related to Gu Yunnian.

512
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,740
Gu Yunnian has been keeping a low profile lately,

513
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,660
but he's been searching

514
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,820
for a man called Zhong Hai.

515
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,060
Zhong Hai?

516
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,620
Him?

517
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,900
Yes.

518
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,780
He's one of the surviving members

519
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,020
of the Di troops that we're looking for.

520
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,940
Qianyue Pavilion has found out

521
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,820
that he once fled to Jiangnan,

522
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,020
but the floods ruined his life.

523
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,660
The Zhongs then took him in,

524
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,940
and since then, he's been loyal to the Zhongs.

525
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,540
He may also be

526
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,500
the only witness to the Zhong's familicide.

527
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,780
This is probably why Gu Yunnian

528
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,900
wanted to kill them all.

529
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,140
Zhong Hai

530
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,140
will become our key to bringing down Gu Yunnian.

531
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,580
Then, we have to find him

532
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,260
before Gu Yunnian does.

533
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
But

534
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,260
if he's still in Jiangnan,

535
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,820
we might not make it in time.

536
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,780
I have an idea.

537
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,740
Your Highness, this way.

538
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,060
Your Highness.

539
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,140
You look well.

540
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,300
I see you have recovered.

541
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,820
It's just a minor cold.

542
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,500
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

543
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,820
I've been feeling better since this morning.

544
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,540
You're practicing writing?

545
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,060
I wrote some poetry

546
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,420
while I had nothing to do.

547
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Here you go, Your Highness.

548
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,180
(Her handwriting)

549
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,660
(is still the same as in the past.)

550
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,420
I remember

551
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,140
you caused an uproar when you wrote

552
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,740
a plaque for your residence.

553
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,020
Because of that,

554
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,140
His Majesty lectured me.

555
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,060
Do you still remember?

556
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,940
Back then,

557
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,540
I was just eight years old.

558
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,740
There are many things

559
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,780
that I don't remember clearly.

560
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
It's getting late.

561
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
I should go now.

562
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,540
Your Highness, since you came all the way here,

563
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,860
won't you stay a while more?

564
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
You've just recovered,

565
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,780
so you need to rest.

566
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,580
Your Highness.

567
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,500
Your Highness!

568
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,620
Are you all right?

569
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,420
[Guiyuan Pavilion]

570
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,820
Look what I wrote.

571
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,580
Hold this.

572
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,180
Ziyuan!

573
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,540
Show me.

574
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,580
Your Highness?

575
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,860
Your Highness?

576
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,100
What's wrong?

577
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,380
Your Highness?

578
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,940
I'm fine.

579
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,300
I just remembered

580
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,900
I had some work to do.

581
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,340
I'll visit you some other day.

582
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,860
Your Highness, are you in love with Official Ren?

583
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,500
If you think

584
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,340
that you're disappointing Official Ren,

585
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
you may still

586
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,740
marry her

587
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,100
in the future.

588
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,620
You're overthinking.

589
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,820
Ren Anle is a palace official

590
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
and a pillar of the nation.

591
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,060
I will not marry her.

592
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,260
Your Highness?

593
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,820
Would you believe

594
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,980
that ten years can change someone's temperament

595
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,700
and even eliminate a scar completely?

596
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,660
I only know

597
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,780
that both life and people

598
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,260
are unpredictable.

599
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,860
Get someone to investigate

600
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,660
what happened over the past ten years

601
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,580
in Dai Mountain.

602
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,500
Yes, Your Highness.

603
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,780
The Crown Prince has already left.

604
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,020
Mu Qing.

605
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,940
Did I accidentally expose something?

606
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,340
The way the Crown Prince looked at me

607
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,260
definitely looked different.

608
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,580
Is he suspecting me because I can't remember

609
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,020
what happened in the past?

610
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,620
Who would remember every single detail

611
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,540
from ten years ago?

612
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,380
The Crown Prince would understand.

613
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,180
Han Ye.

614
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,860
The person who has returned
to honor her promise

615
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
can only be me.

616
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,140
[Residence of the Princess]

617
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,340
Marquis Jing'an fought
for the nation his entire life.

618
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,220
But in just ten years,

619
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,140
everyone has forgotten him.

620
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,300
I'm worried that I'd end up like them

621
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,100
if I'm away from the Northwest for too long,

622
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,100
slowly forgotten by the people.

623
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,900
But even after heroes die,

624
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,060
they remain heroes.

625
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,140
Just like you, General,

626
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,380
I will always remember them.

627
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,620
As long as we don't forget,

628
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,900
they will never truly die.

629
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,380
You said the same thing as Anle did.

630
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,620
Do you believe that the Di family
did not commit treason

631
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,820
and that they're innocent?

632
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,420
If they were not loyal to the nation,

633
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,620
why would you still remember them

634
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,300
even after ten years?

635
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,300
Lengbei.

636
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
It's been ten years.

637
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,660
My heart feels like it's being crushed
by a huge stone.

638
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,580
I had no one to confide in.

639
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,380
To think

640
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,460
you could understand me.

641
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,380
You can always tell me

642
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,100
what is bothering you.

643
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,260
You should get some rest.

644
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,220
Please leave the documents

645
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,540
to me.

646
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,380
We just met this morning,

647
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,340
and you called me here again.

648
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,820
You're already missing me?

649
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,180
I called you over

650
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,820
to tell you something important.

651
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,100
I know.

652
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,340
It's about Di Cheng'en.

653
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,740
What did Mu Qing tell you?

654
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,660
The Crown Prince is suspecting Di Cheng'en.

655
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,100
Do you remember what happened when you wrote

656
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,780
the plaque for Guiyuan Pavilion?

657
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,820
When I was seven,

658
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,140
I wrote the plaque for Guiyuan Pavilion,

659
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,580
but I accidentally fell from a high spot.

660
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,100
My shoulder had a severe gash.

661
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,860
They got the best imperial physicians
to treat me,

662
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,420
but it still left a scar as long as half a cun.

663
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,580
Han Zhongyuan reprimanded Han Ye
because of this,

664
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,060
and Han Ye even stayed in my residence

665
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,580
to look after me for ten days.

666
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,140
It seems

667
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,340
that Han Ye discovered that Di Cheng'en

668
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,260
does not have the scar.

669
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,380
It's been ten years.

670
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,220
Even the deepest scars would fade.

671
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,860
Even I can't remember much of it.

672
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,820
To think he still remembers everything.

673
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,140
It's fine even if he remembers.

674
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Since you've decided to keep
your distance from him,

675
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,140
just don't get too close,

676
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,780
then he'd never find out.

677
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,580
That's right.

678
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,740
There's no need to create the same scar
on Di Cheng'en's shoulder too.

679
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,300
Creating the scar now

680
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,660
would only prove her disguise

681
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,100
