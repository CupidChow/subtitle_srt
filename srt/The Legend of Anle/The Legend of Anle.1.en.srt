I noticed you sleeping here in thin layers.

185
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,230
I was worried that you might catch a cold.
I meant you no harm.

186
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,630
No harm, you say?

187
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,230
But you were being so sneaky.

188
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,870
I've explained to you.

189
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,630
We're of opposite sexes.

190
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,870
Miss, please let me go for your own good.

191
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,230
You have a great demeanor.

192
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,300
I'm flattered.

193
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,150
I can't even praise you now?

194
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,230
I know I have wronged you.

195
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,470
You are a decent man.

196
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,230
Thank you.

197
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,110
It's wet there.

198
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,110
Sit down over here.

199
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,420
It's fine.

200
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,990
Thank you for your kind intentions.

201
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,780
Miss.

202
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,630
You shouldn't be sleeping here

203
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,870
all alone.

204
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,230
Why not?

205
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,750
I sleep wherever I go.

206
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,540
What's wrong with that?

207
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,900
You might attract people

208
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,510
with malicious motives.

209
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,820
A malicious guy who would cover me up

210
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,030
in the rain?

211
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,540
My apologies

212
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,750
for my indiscreet advice.

213
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,230
Follow me, that guy is over there!

214
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,750
The spies from Dongqian are here.

215
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:58,900
Run!

216
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,270
Miss!

217
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,420
Miss!

218
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,700
Over there!

219
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,580
Hurry up!

220
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,870
Don't run!

221
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,110
Miss!

222
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,180
Miss!

223
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,580
We can stop running.

224
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,750
They're not after us anymore.

225
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,750
It's too early to tell.

226
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,780
They're a bunch of crooks.

227
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,630
It's obvious that you're from a noble family.

228
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,870
I bet you've never had any experience with this.

229
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,750
You look experienced, though.

230
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,990
May I ask what you do for a living?

231
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,390
Cold blood runs in a snake's body,

232
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,630
and a pungent stench wafts around a wolf.

233
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,870
I'm a wanderer in Jianghu.

234
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,110
I can judge a book by its cover.

235
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,510
I guess my worries were unfounded.

236
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,630
Still, rest assured, miss.

237
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,110
Even if they catch up,

238
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,230
I will protect you.

239
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,110
You won't even get a scratch.

240
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,750
Don't say that just yet.

241
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,750
A powerful outlander
can't suppress a local villain.

242
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,990
We still need to hide if we have to.

243
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,110
Check the pier!

244
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,110
Hide now!

245
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,390
Search over there.

246
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,700
They're gone.

247
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,780
Miss.

248
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,110
You can get up now.

249
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,150
They've gone far.

250
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,510
Don't move.

251
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,110
They might come back again.

252
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,230
What are you doing?

253
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,230
Better be safe than sorry.

254
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,510
Alright.

255
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,510
I'm sure they won't catch up now.

256
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,300
Isn't it dangerous

257
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,470
to go out to sea at this hour?

258
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,780
It's still safe for now.

259
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,110
We're traveling downwind.

260
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,390
The winds might change when we return, though.

261
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,780
(I can't afford to waste time on the sea.)

262
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,580
(But it'd be a headwind journey
if we head back now.)

263
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,180
(It might be difficult.)

264
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,630
Miss.

265
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,990
Have you been wandering around alone

266
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,750
over the years?

267
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,510
It's free to be alone.

268
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,230
Nothing holds me back,

269
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,390
and I can do whatever I want.

270
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,110
Besides, I'm a lucky girl.

271
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,110
Fate always brings the right people to me.

272
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,750
That's why

273
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,350
I met you today.

274
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,470
It's about to rain.

275
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,780
(The sea seems calm.)

276
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,030
(If I don't return now,)

277
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,950
(I might miss the opportunity of war.)

278
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,990
(Why is this boat spinning at the same spot?)

279
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,860
Mister.

280
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,910
When are you going to row ashore

281
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,270
at this pathetic rate?

282
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,030
Come on.

283
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
I'll teach you how to row.

284
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,300
Lift the oar up.

285
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,780
Miss, I can do it myself.

286
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,540
Then, put the oar down and row.

287
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,470
Miss, I can manage.

288
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,300
Put the oar down.

289
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,100
-See?
-I can row myself.

290
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,060
Row.

291
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,540
The oar.

292
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,100
Don't move!

293
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,950
You...

294
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,470
You told me not to move.

295
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,190
Mister.

296
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,140
You can't row,

297
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,470
but you didn't wake me up.
Is it because you care about me?

298
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,950
I didn't want to trouble a stranger.

299
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,540
It takes a century of affinity
to get on the same boat.

300
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,060
Looks like we share a deep connection.

301
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,820
Now that the sea is calm,

302
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,540
how will we go back?

303
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,470
It's a sunny day, and it's just the two of us.

304
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,510
Obviously, Heaven wants us
to spend some alone time together.

305
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,540
You can't run away from fate.

306
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,100
Miss.

307
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,470
I have something urgent to handle in Jingnan.

308
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,710
I can't waste so much time on the sea.

309
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,670
Well...

310
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,270
Miss, is there anything I can do for you?

311
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,780
The sea is calm.

312
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,300
Since you're eager to leave,

313
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,910
are you willing to do anything

314
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,950
I ask of you?

315
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,270
Take your clothes off.

316
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,750
What are you doing?

317
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,670
How can I make a sail without cloth?

318
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,580
Fine.

319
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,270
Since you won't take off your clothes,

320
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,270
I'll take mine off.

321
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,910
Miss, don't do this.

322
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,340
Mister.

323
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
For you, I'll give up more than my clothes.

324
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,430
Miss.

325
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,710
No need for this.

326
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,620
Aren't you in a rush to leave?

327
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,710
I'm helping you now.

328
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,270
Miss.

329
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,950
Some ships are coming this way.

330
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,100
[Dongqian Pirate Fleet]

331
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,100
It's the Dongqian Pirates.

332
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,820
These pirates are vicious

333
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,820
and merciless.

334
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,860
We need to leave here right now.

335
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,380
Mister, can you tread water?

336
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,470
Capsized boat spotted!

337
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,030
General!

338
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,910
Mister, you can't row a boat,

339
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,620
but you sure know how to tread in water.

340
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,270
I don't deserve such high praise.

341
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,950
To survive in this world,

342
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,430
we have to acquire a skill or two.

343
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,910
Mister, we've just met not long ago,

344
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,470
and you're calling yourself a wanderer in Jianghu.

345
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,580
Looks like

346
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,190
we have much in common.

347
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,710
Not at all.

348
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,470
In fact, you're braver than I thought.

349
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,430
The Dongqian Pirates are just in front of us,

350
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,230
and you still have the mood for banter.

351
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,540
Mister, you ought to spend more time with me,

352
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,670
and then you'll be surprised how bold you can be.

353
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,910
What should we do now?

354
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
When the time comes, you should leave

355
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,430
while I lure them away.

356
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,230
If you're not leaving, I won't.

357
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,340
Turn the boat over.

358
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,620
Mister.

359
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,620
If we manage to get out of this alive,

360
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,230
I shall marry you.

361
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,470
Enemy spotted!

362
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,540
It's the Anle Abode!

363
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,270
General, it's the Anle Abode!

364
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,100
Anle Abode?

365
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Mister, remember what I told you.

366
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,030
If we get out of this alive,

367
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,510
I will marry you for sure.

368
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,190
Welcome aboard, Chief!

369
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,820
Welcome aboard, Chief!

370
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,250
[Servants to Ren Anle, Yuanqin and Yuanshu]

371
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Welcome aboard, Chief!

372
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,030
I am Ren Anle, the Chief of Anle Abode.

373
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,470
[Chief of Anle Abode, Ren Anle]
If you petty evildoers

374
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,910
dare invade Jing,

375
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,140
I will...

376
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,030
What will I do?

377
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,190
You will eradicate them all!

378
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,100
Eradicate them all!

379
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,020
I will eradicate them all!

380
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
(Eradicate them all!)

381
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,100
(Eradicate them all!)

382
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,710
See?

383
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,060
I told you.

384
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,270
Don't write such fancy words for the Chief.

385
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,300
She can't remember them.

386
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,230
(Eradicate them all!)

387
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,430
Seventy-nine.

388
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,710
Dongqian Pirates.

389
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,030
Death count, 79.

390
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,470
Ren Anle!

391
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,910
Mister, that's the first time you called my name.

392
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,470
I like it.

393
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Young Lady, I'm coming to help you!

394
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,780
Out of the way!

395
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,670
Can't you see I have help already?

396
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,780
Even with the enemy in front of us,

397
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,190
you're still trying to protect me.

398
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,300
How dare these Dongqian Pirates

399
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,540
hurt my man.

400
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,780
(The Dongqian Pirates
have been fully exterminated.)

401
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,750
(All their ships have been confiscated.)

402
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,820
(Nice blade.)

403
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,620
(Show me.)

404
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,300
(Where did you get this?)

405
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,030
(I'll take it.)

406
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,910
(Take it.)

407
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,540
Wait.

408
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,910
What are they doing?

409
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,860
Applying medicine.

410
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,380
Applying medicine?

411
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,300
Mister,

412
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,950
I'm not trying to take advantage of you.

413
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,100
I'm applying medicine to your wound.

414
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,430
Who knows if they poisoned their arrows?

415
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,780
If you don't apply medicine in time,

416
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,300
you might lose your arm.

417
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,780
Chief Ren, have some respect for both of us.

418
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,910
We're under the scrutiny of the public.

419
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,540
Nice!

420
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,990
The public?

421
00:28:59,380 --> 00:28:59,950
Come here.

422
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,860
Pretend that she doesn't exist.

423
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,030
Come on.

424
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,300
Don't move.

425
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,430
I can manage.

426
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,190
Chief.

427
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,270
The navy forces from the Southeast are here.

428
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,780
There's a fleet ahead.

429
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
They're from Anle Abode.

430
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,470
Quick, get ready!

431
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,060
These military slowpokes

432
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,270
only arrive after the battle has ended.

433
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,100
Alright, then.

434
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,710
Feed the dead bodies to the fish.

435
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,340
We're retreating.

436
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,190
No need.

437
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,710
I know them.

438
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,100
Mister, you're from the military?

439
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,860
All the more reason we need to retreat.

440
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,710
Move it! Keep everything!

441
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,190
Throw the bodies into the sea!

442
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:26,670
Yes, Chief!

443
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,430
Hurry up!

444
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,580
Your Highness, I'm here!

445
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,340
I am the Crown Prince of Jing,

446
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,750
Han Ye.

447
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,620
You are the Crown Prince of Jing?

448
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,510
Now that I've saved you,

449
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,270
doesn't that mean
I will become the Crown Princess?

450
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,550
Chief Ren, you did save me.

451
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
By right, I...

452
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,820
Regardless of anything,

453
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,340
I should thank you.

454
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,990
But, about the position of Crown Princess,

455
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,710
I already have a fiancee.

456
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,710
I saved your life and you only said thank you.

457
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,140
Your Highness.

458
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,860
You must be joking.

459
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,100
Chief Ren, what do you want?

460
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,990
I will do my best to grant your wishes.

461
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,420
What I want is you.

462
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,620
Alright, I'm taking this

463
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,030
as the engagement gift.

464
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,860
My apologies.

465
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,070
I told you

466
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,900
my late grandfather
had betrothed me to another lady.

467
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,860
And you will marry no one but her?

468
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,620
I will marry no one but her.

469
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,140
Even if I offer a navy force of 30,000 men as my dowry,

470
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,900
are you still not changing your mind?

471
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,900
Chief Ren, it was brave and kind of you

472
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,860
to help the state eradicate the pirates.

473
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,230
You have the potential to become a general.

474
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,340
If you'd like,

475
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,990
I can recommend you to the imperial court.

476
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,140
Your Highness.

477
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,340
What I want is you,

478
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,030
not an official position.

479
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,660
I saved your life,

480
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,950
and we spent a night together.

481
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,790
The Crown Prince gave me
his treasured ornament as the engagement gift,

482
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,100
while I offered a navy force
of 30,000 men as my dowry.

483
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,380
Your Highness.

484
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,140
Thank you.

485
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,660
It's a deal. I hope you'll follow through.

486
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,620
Ren Anle.

487
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,660
Since when did I promise you anything?

488
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,030
That doesn't matter.

489
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,710
The thing is, everyone knows about it now.

490
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,140
Your Highness!

491
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,030
The Crown Prince is going to Anle Abode with me.

492
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,270
Send someone there to pick him up tomorrow.

493
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,270
Jili, Jili!

494
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,180
A wasted effort.

495
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,660
Jili!

496
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,140
Jili!

497
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,710
Your Highness!

498
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,710
I'm here!

499
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,950
Your Highness!

500
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,310
Your Highness!

501
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,660
(After that,)

502
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,420
(I ordered the Southeastern Navy Troops to
join the sailors from Anle Abode,)

503
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,140
(and we exterminated the Dongqian Pirates.)

504
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,860
(Ren Anle and Anle Abode
have played a crucial part)

505
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,820
(in this battle.)

506
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,470
This is the entirety of what happened.

507
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,310
Chief Ren offered

508
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,510
her 30,000 naval soldiers in exchange
for the position of Crown Princess.

509
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,750
[Emperor Jiachang of Jing, Han Zhongyuan]
Her offer was just a whim at that moment.

510
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,180
[Grand Chancellors, Wei Jian and Jiang Yu]
It should not be taken seriously.

511
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,180
"My 30,000 navy sailors and I
will pledge allegiance to Jing.

512
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,950
I do not need anything else in return.

513
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,710
All I ask for is the position of Crown Princess.

514
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,820
All I ask for is the position of Crown Princess.

515
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,070
All I ask for is the position of Crown Princess."

516
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,510
She wrote the same sentence thrice.

517
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,180
Ren Anle is an interesting figure, I see.

518
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,470
So, Your Highness, you spent

519
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,700
the entire night with her.

520
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,660
Grand Chancellor of the Left, please mind your words.

521
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,070
I have nothing to do with Ren Anle.

522
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,180
She healed my wound, that's all.

523
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,830
Your Majesty.

524
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,300
Regardless of anything else,

525
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,070
Ren Anle's 30,000 naval soldiers

526
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,550
[Marquis Zhongyi, Gu Yunnian]
is the only chance to restore peace in Jingnan.

527
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,740
Naturally.

528
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,700
However, this decision entails huge implications.

529
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,070
Are we really

530
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,700
going to make her the Crown Princess?

531
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,350
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

532
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,830
You may leave.

533
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,830
The Crown Prince stays.

534
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,550
Crown Prince.

535
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,140
You exterminated the Dongqian Pirates this time.

536
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,660
I am heartened to hear that.

537
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
However, while a man establishes his career,

538
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,510
he needs to build a family as well.

539
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,660
I am committed to honor
my late grandfather's order.

540
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,300
I will marry no one else except Ziyuan.

541
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,550
The Dongqian Pirates have been decimated.

542
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,260
I dare not take the credit,

543
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,300
but I beg you, Your Majesty,

544
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,830
to release Di Ziyuan from exile.

545
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,100
If we follow your logic,

546
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,350
Ren Anle was indispensable

547
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,950
in exterminating the Dongqian Pirates,

548
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,700
and what she wants

549
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,620
is also the position of Crown Princess.

550
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,140
I will do my best to persuade her

551
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,100
to receive other rewards instead.

552
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,510
The daughter of a sinful official
and a female pirate from the outskirts

553
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,140
are both unfit to become the Crown Princess.

554
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,580
The Spring Hunt is on the 15th day of this month.

555
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,220
Get ready for it.

556
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

557
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,720
[Ministry of Justice]

558
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,990
(Ziyuan.)

559
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,220
(The Dongqian Pirates have been exterminated,)

560
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,910
(but I still couldn't earn a chance
for you to leave the mountains.)

561
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,550
(In the entire Jing State,)

562
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,390
(I can only share my woes with Luo Mingxi.)

563
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,580
(And I)

564
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,140
(can only reminisce time and again)

565
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,220
(so that I can remember your eyes and draw them.)

566
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,030
Your Highness.

567
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,660
Luo Mingxi.

568
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,220
You should change your bad habit

569
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,470
of walking stealthily.

570
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,070
This is how I have always been walking.

571
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,740
Your Highness, you should get used to it.

572
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,830
Have a seat.

573
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,620
Why have you come to visit me

574
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,390
at this late hour?

575
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,870
What's the point of yearning for her?

576
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,390
The emperor still refuses to release Ziyuan.

577
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,070
Moreover, during the Spring Hunt
in a few days' time,

578
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,990
the emperor has invited
many noble ladies for you to meet.

579
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,740
That's why

580
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,180
you're the only one

581
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,580
I can talk to about Ziyuan.

582
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,220
I've never felt pressured
by the palace's constant urging.

583
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,620
I'm just scared that since ten years have passed,

584
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,430
even I am beginning

585
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,660
to forget what she looks like.

586
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,510
She must have grown older, taller,

587
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,220
and become different from what we recall,

588
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,780
but her eyes would never change.

589
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,620
It's her eyes.

590
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,350
Just remembering

591
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,220
how she looked at me with those eyes,

592
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,780
I can never enjoy the extravagant banquets

593
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,910
His Majesty has prepared for me.

594
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,580
(The late emperor appointed me
as the next Crown Princess.)

595
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,620
(Did he ask for my opinion back then?)

596
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
His Majesty reserves the position
of the Crown Princess for me.

597
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,990
Again, has he ever asked for my opinion?

598
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,180
The Crown Prince is here.

599
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,140
The Crown Prince is here.

600
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,030
It really is him.

601
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,180
It's His Highness!

602
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,660
I heard that a female pirate

603
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,070
is trying to marry the Crown Prince.

604
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,300
What a joke.

605
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,180
Exactly.

606
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,220
His Highness is so dashing.

607
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,180
He wouldn't pay attention to a pirate.

608
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,550
Exactly.

609
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,740
What do you think

610
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,070
Ren Anle looks like?

611
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,070
She must be a barbarian

612
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,220
with strong, burly arms.

613
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,780
Right?

614
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,700
I'm going to bet that she's a beauty, though.

615
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,660
Wen Shuo.

616
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,100
You're joining our bet too?

617
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,350
Someone who could fight alongside the Crown Prince

618
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,660
[Page to the Crown Prince, Wen Shuo]
to defeat the Dongqian Pirates

619
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,100
could never be an ugly woman.

620
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,910
Everyone knows that the Crown Prince

621
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,550
is pining for someone.

622
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,430
Even though she can't leave Dai Mountain,

623
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,100
she won't get replaced easily

624
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,070
by a female pirate.

625
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,780
Exactly.

626
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,430
Do you think the Crown Prince
has really fallen in love with her?

627
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,510
I don't think so.

628
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,100
I don't think so, either.

629
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,430
Now, everyone in the upper echelons of the state

630
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,030
must have heard

631
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,430
that the Crown Prince
is the most handsome man in the state,

632
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,100
and even a female pirate

633
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,220
is willing to offer 30,000 navy forces
just so you'll marry her.

634
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,260
No.

635
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,910
She wants to marry you.

636
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,140
Have you revised your studies?

637
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,350
I know.

638
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,260
Even if you do fall in love with someone else,

639
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,910
only that lady in the Dai Mountain
will be the Crown Princess.

640
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,350
But, we're placing bets

641
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,700
on whether Ren Anle is pretty or burly.

642
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,470
Your Highness, mind giving me a tip?

643
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,620
Jili?

644
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,510
Well?

645
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,550
Look.

646
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,470
[Ren Anle's servant, Yuanqin]

647
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,580
She's

648
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,740
as beautiful as the morning sun

649
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,990
and a lily blossoming on a lake.

650
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,180
Where did she come from?

651
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,180
She killed two birds with one shot!

652
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,140
Amazing!

653
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,830
Marvelous!

654
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,220
Your Highness.

655
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,180
We meet again.

656
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,070
Miss?

657
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,620
You are...?

658
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,660
My name is Ren Anle.

659
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,510
