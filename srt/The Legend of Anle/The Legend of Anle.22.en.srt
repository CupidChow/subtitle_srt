00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,340
Not worth mentioning, though.

190
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,700
Life there was about being forced
to go practicing and go out to the sea

191
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,180
while mingling around with rough men.

192
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,260
Everyone was always in haste

193
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,220
when we ate or took a shower.

194
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,820
Things never waited for me.

195
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,820
Aren't you the daughter of the Chief?

196
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,580
That makes no difference.

197
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,420
We need to be impartial

198
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,700
to convince the other pirates.

199
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,820
Anle Abode only pedestalizes great strength.

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,940
The Chief shouldn't have privileges.

201
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,820
Otherwise, we'd be thrown into the sea.

202
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,580
How could they do that do you?

203
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,340
Your Highness, no need to get upset about this.

204
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,980
I'm a pirate.

205
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,860
There's no way

206
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,500
they should treat me like a noble lady.

207
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,460
Still, you're a woman.

208
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,060
We have to accept the destiny

209
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,420
of our births.

210
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,100
I was born in a water fortress,

211
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,340
and I'm meant to be a pirate.

212
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,620
Your Highness.

213
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,860
Are you feeling bad for me?

214
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,820
Don't be.

215
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,500
I've already toughed it out.

216
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,820
And now you're caring about me,

217
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,060
so all those hardships I've been through

218
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,700
is worthwhile, then.

219
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,140
Anle.

220
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,380
Once we return,

221
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,980
I'll take Di Cheng'en

222
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,700
as my Crown Princess.

223
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,460
(It's finally happening.)

224
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,260
In that case,

225
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,260
I'll let go of my obsession with you

226
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,460
and offer both of you fine brew

227
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,060
as my blessing.

228
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,460
Thank you.

229
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,100
I accept your blessing.

230
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Hopefully,

231
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,700
Di Cheng'en and I

232
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,260
can always be happy throughout our life

233
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
as you wished.

234
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,460
That'd be great.

235
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,940
As the ancient people said,

236
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,940
"When a shooting star, as radiant as the moon,

237
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,940
hovers in the middle of the sky,

238
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,980
it signifies a great fortune
will grace the state."

239
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,700
True. A great fortune.

240
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,940
Ren Anle.

241
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,000
Do you still remember that day
when people in Mutian Prefecture

242
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,500
were releasing wishing lanterns by the river?

243
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,940
I do. Why do you bring this up?

244
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,740
It's a shame that we didn't release

245
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,620
any wishing lanterns.

246
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,980
Look, stars in the sky

247
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,180
are like lanterns.

248
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,660
Why don't we make a wish upon them?

249
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,420
All right?

250
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,580
You're the Crown Prince of Jing.

251
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,820
You will get everything you ask for.

252
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Why do you even need to make a wish?

253
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,220
What about you?

254
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,740
My wish

255
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,540
can't be achieved by praying to Heaven.

256
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,860
You know what it is.

257
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,420
I do.

258
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,340
Ren Anle.

259
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,540
Your Highness.

260
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,700
I once fell for a woman

261
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,540
called Ren Anle.

262
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,580
However, in this life,

263
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,980
I'll keep Di Ziyuan safe.

264
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,740
Please

265
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,060
never forget this.

266
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,770
♪Do you feel guilty?
I raise a glass to my reflection in the mirror♪

267
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:30,560
♪Tender old times are merely a tint of life♪

268
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:39,270

♪Forlorn fates intertwine,

272
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,260
(If it weren't for my warm care,)

273
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,820
(why would you develop feelings for me)

274
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,460
(and leave Di Ziyuan behind)

275
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,220
(whom you've been waiting for over ten years?)

276
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,900
(I'll help you)

277
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,660
(revisit the scene on that day.)

278
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,220
♪I'm mooning over you amidst loneliness,
berthed in sleepless nights♪

279
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,420
(Your Highness, you can't let go)

280
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,740
(the obsession with Miss Di,)

281
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,420
(is it because you feel guilty?)

282
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,170

284
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,180
Well...

285
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,660
We should go back now.

286
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,020
But this time,

287
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,900
you and I must stay well

288
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
until the end.

289
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,460
Sure.

290
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,900
General.

291
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,260
Both the Crown Prince and Official Ren

292
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,980
will be back safe and sound.

293
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,420
No matter how hard it is,

294
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,020
I will find them.

295
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,420
I believe the full sky of stars

296
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,260
knows you will.

297
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,820
What's wrong?

298
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,580
I'm good.

299
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,140
Did you sprain your ankle?

300
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,980
I think so.

301
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,940
Stay still.

302
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,900
Is it here?

303
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,140
Feeling better?

304
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,220
Yes. We should go now.

305
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,620
Get on my back.

306
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
What are you doing?

307
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,700
You carried me when we came here.

308
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,020
Needless to say, I should return your favor
when we're going back.

309
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,740
Come on.

310
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,260
Maybe

311
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,900
we can stay here a bit longer?

312
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,460
Sure.

313
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,060
Are you tired?

314
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,780
Sleep.

315
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,260
I'll wake you up later.

316
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,340
Your Highness!

317
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,940
Ye!

318
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,060
Your Highness!

319
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,500
That way.

320
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,220
Ye!

321
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,300
Your Highness!

322
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,500
Come here.

323
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,980
Quick, come here.

324
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,020
There they are.

325
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,100
(How did they manage to survive?)

326
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,980
Ziyuan.

327
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
It's time.

328
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,620
We should go back.

329
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,860
Official Luo.

330
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,220
Official Ren is saved.

331
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,060
Official Luo.

332
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,740
Official Luo.

333
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,010
Please take care of yourself.

334
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,450
You shouldn't neglect your...

335
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,290
I'm good.

336
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,770
How's the Western Outpost coming along?

337
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,090
Tip came through.

338
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,530
As expected, it wasn't Marquis Zhongyi.

339
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,290
But the mastermind remains mysterious.

340
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,690
Qianyue Pavilion will continue
to look into this.

341
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,050
Yes, sir.

342
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,450
All right.

343
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,210
You may leave.

344
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,850
Please rest well.

345
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,770
I shall take my leave.

346
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,770
Go ahead.

347
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,170
Your Majesty!

348
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,770
We've found His Highness!

349
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,650
Your Majesty.

350
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,850
Princess Anning has someone
to deliver the message.

351
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,530
[Your Majesty]
His Highness wrote this himself.

352
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,010
Good.

353
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,090
What a relief.

354
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,570
Your Majesty.

355
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,770
No.

356
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,930
Get the imperial physician!

357
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,850
I'm too happy.

358
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,210
I'm over the moon.

359
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,690
Your Majesty, you're really

360
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,090
worried about His Highness.

361
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,090
Not only is he the Crown Prince of Jing,

362
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,170
but he's also my son.

363
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,450
Yes.

364
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,970
Han Ye.

365
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,490
Don't make noise.

366
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,970
Go somewhere else to collect the firewood.

367
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,050
You're awake?

368
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,050
Have we left the valley?

369
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,330
Yes.

370
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,770
If so,

371
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,770
you'll soon be someone's husband.

372
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,570
Please adhere to the etiquette.

373
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,490
Don't let your bride down.

374
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,850
Take a sip to wet your throat.

375
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,570
Ginseng tea?

376
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,250
I don't want it.

377
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,850
You're weak now.

378
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,570
It's good for you.

379
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,370
You don't like the bitter taste?

380
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,490
Jili only prepared some fruit here.

381
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,050
Are we arriving in the capital?

382
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,170
Yes.

383
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,010
What's on your mind, General?

384
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,690
Lengbei, did you discern anything?

385
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,170
Why do you ask so?

386
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,770
Did you see the face of Ye

387
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,170
when he carried Anle on his back in the valley?

388
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,650
Official Ren was unconscious.

389
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,930
It's understandable
for His Highness to take care...

390
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,530
No.

391
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,770
The way Ye looked at her had changed.

392
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,930
(Did he find out that she was Ziyuan?)

393
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,010
(No, I shouldn't overthink it.)

394
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,290
Maybe he feels bad for Anle, who falls sick

395
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,290
after saving him.

396
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,210
Anle.

397
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,530
We're reaching soon.

398
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,250
Once we reach,

399
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,810
I'll seek an audience with His Majesty
to report everything to him.

400
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,730
You should return to get a rest

401
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,330
and come back for duty

402
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,850
after some days.

403
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,890
Also, I'll report your merits in this incident

404
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,010
to His Majesty

405
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,290
once you're back on the mend.

406
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,610
We're back in the capital,

407
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,210
are you happy?

408
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,130
I am.

409
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,170
Me too.

410
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,370
The most joyous moment in life

411
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,850
is when one triumphs in the examination

412
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,970
or the wedding night.

413
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,610
We'll part ways soon.

414
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,930
May our prayers

415
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,610
will be answered.

416
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,810
I, Luo Mingxi,

417
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,930
welcome Your Highness and Official Ren back.

418
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:55,930
Ren Anle.

419
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,010
My prayer was answered

420
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,650
on the day I fell off the cliff.

421
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,930
Though I'm getting married to Di Cheng'en

422
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,570
afterward,

423
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,490
I'm still glad

424
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,090
that you're Ren Anle, not Di Cheng'en.

425
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,570
And I hope

426
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,850
you can carry on with this name.

427
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,210
Be it a pirate back in Jingnan,

428
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,570
or you stand beside me in the imperial court,

429
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,570
as long as you remain as Ren Anle,

430
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,930
I won't have any worries, then.

431
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,530
Your Highness.

432
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,410
I have my own things to do.

433
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,010
I'm not living to ease your worries.

434
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,010
Ren Anle.

435
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,650
His Majesty has been ruling the Jing State
for over a decade,

436
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,650
his cruelty is beyond your expectation.

437
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,770
You always act unruly and recklessly.

438
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,730
Before I can fully protect you,

439
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,090
don't overstep the line of the reign.

440
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,930
Make sure you stay alive.

441
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,770
You took me wrong.

442
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,770
His Majesty is a benevolent emperor

443
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,650
and treats his subjects kindly.

444
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,330
I've received his grace.

445
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,690
Why would I offend His Majesty?

446
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:59,390
[Yuanshui Pavilion]

447
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,730
Ren Anle and His Highness
were in the same carriage.

448
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,010
I was groveling to her previously.

449
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,570
It turns out she was just brushing me off,

450
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,410
saying that she would adhere to the etiquette.

451
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,170
Since His Highness has returned,

452
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,570
the wedding will be put on the table.

453
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,690
Don't let such trivial matters get to you.

454
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,170
Imperial Guards and the people

455
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,210
are looking at them

456
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,850
being so close.

457
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,170
How can this be a trivial matter?

458
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,250
They're always on intimate terms, to begin with.

459
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,250
And now, they've spent so many days together

460
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,170
at the bottom of a valley.

461
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:49,690
Mu Qing.

462
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,690
Will His Highness change his mind?

463
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,850
Will he renounce me?

464
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,530
Everyone has their own destiny.

465
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,690
Perhaps

466
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,410
it might be good for you.

467
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,170
Destiny?

468
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,730
I could change my identity and name.

469
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,330
I can change my destiny as well.

470
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,930
I heard His Highness is sick.

471
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,850
I must visit him.

472
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,330
Not this hairpin.

473
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,690
Not this one.

474
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,570
I have to look gaunter.

475
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,130
From the first encounter in the capital

476
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,050
to the widely-known marriage proposal,

477
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,170
Ren Anle,

478
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,930
the target of your 30,000 navy forces
is never after me

479
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,730
nor trades for a post.

480
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,170
What are you after?

481
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,130
Ye.

482
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,730
Ye.

483
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:53,850
You're injured now.

484
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,250
You should rest in bed.

485
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,730
So, you knew it.

486
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,050
Anle and Ziyuan

487
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,770
are the same person.

488
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,050
Yeah.

489
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,290
She's been beside us all this time,

490
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,290
and yet we only got to recognize her recently.

491
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,290
But, Ye,

492
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,290
I feel somehow sad

493
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,610
and happy at the same time.

494
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,250
I can relate to you.

495
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,050
Though I only found this out later,

496
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,050
I'm still happy for her.

497
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,170
I'm happy that she's been living freely
over the past decade.

498
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,850
And more,

499
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,890
she has grown into a free soul.

500
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,650
I'm afraid that Ziyuan

501
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,530
didn't live as freely as you thought
for the past decade.

502
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,050
Pirates stay on the water since infancy.

503
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,850
They have no roof over their heads

504
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,690
and are exposed to danger.

505
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,050
She must've suffered a lot back then.

506
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,650
Still, I'm relieved

507
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,330
that the one up in Dai Mountain wasn't her.

508
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,330
I hope Anle

509
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,570
can carry on with her life in this way.

510
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,850
She will.

511
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,850
I will shield her lifelong

512
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,250
against blizzards out there.

513
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,250
You're in delicate health now.

514
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,490
Take good care of yourself.

515
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,450
But I don't have

516
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,090
a delicate frame as you do.

517
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,090
You're exhausted this time.

518
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,770
You ought to have enough rest.

519
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,050
Don't worry. I'm strong.

520
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,250
When you and Han Ye

521
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,290
were at the valley bottom these days...

522
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,850
I was about to tell you that.

523
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,930
I'm sure you've never seen

524
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,090
the naughty side of Han Ye.

525
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,570
He refused to help me

526
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,770
after saving my life

527
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,490
but kept bossing me around.

528
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,730
Not only that,

529
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,210
-he never stopped whining about his wound...
-Ziyuan.

530
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,130
Did you realize

531
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,290
that something changed about Han Ye for you?

532
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,130
Did he?

533
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,690
Instead, I think

534
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,130
he has become naughtier.

535
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,890
Is it because he's been too close to me?

536
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,850
People can be easily influenced
by their company.

537
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,450
Ziyuan.

538
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,610
You've gone soft, right?

539
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,730
Do you remember

540
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,370
why you gave me the name Anle?

541
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,530
I've been bearing this name for over ten years.

542
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,090
But I only genuinely felt peaceful and joyful

543
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,890
during those days at the bottom of the valley.

544
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,130
It's snowing heavily out here.

545
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,810
Let's go in. I have something to tell you.

546
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,340
[Crown Prince's Residence]

547
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:20,650
Your Highness!

548
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,090
You're His Highness's bodyguard.

549
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,930
How could you let His Highness get hurt so badly?

550
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,970
You must be punished.

551
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,170
I failed my task.

552
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,530
Please punish me, Your Highness.

553
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,610
Get up.

554
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:41,890
It's not your fault.

555
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,850
The imperial court shouldn't know about this.

556
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,570
Don't tell anyone about this.

557
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,250
You may go.

558
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,650
Yes.

559
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,130
I know what to do.

560
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,730
I won't tell anyone.

561
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,330
Your Highness, your health is precious

562
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,770
to shoulder the responsibility for the nation.

563
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,970
Never risk your life again.

564
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,250
Please take care of yourself

565
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,530
for my sake.

566
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,730
I'm a bereaved lady.

567
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,850
My younger brother, Jinyan,

568
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,170
already passed away ten years ago.

569
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,850
I...

570
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,610
I can only rely on you now.

571
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,770
I want to take a nap.

572
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,730
You should go.

573
00:41:59,130 --> 00:41:59,810
Yes.

574
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,130
Please get some good rest.

575
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,330
I'll take my leave.

576
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,930
You're indeed her cat's paw.

577
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,650
Otherwise, you wouldn't have known

578
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,730
that the death of Jinyan still haunts me.
