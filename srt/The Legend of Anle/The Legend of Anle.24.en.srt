You neither want to betray your superiors
nor feel unworthy of your comrades.

are you seeing her in this state?

205

You're right.

213
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,920
My apologies, Official Ren.

214
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
His Highness is not well
because he has been busy lately.

Let me make you some tea first.

220

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,480

Forgive me for disturbing your rest,

No matter.

227
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,040
Do you have to speak so formally?

228
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,720
Wen Shuo,

229
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
don't you still have some books left to memorize?

230
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
I won't disturb you then.

231
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,520
Your Highness,

232
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll go and keep an eye on the young lord.

233
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,280
What's this?

234
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,240
I heard the Crown Princess' conferring ceremony

235
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
will be held during the Empress Dowager's
birthday celebration.

236
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm afraid that I might confuse the gift
for Empress Dowager

237
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
with this one.

238
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,840
So I brought it to you first.

239
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,320
It's a shame.

240
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,760
It was such a beautiful jade fan.

241
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,920
I humbly offer this gift,

242
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,160

and Di Cheng'en a harmonious

243

Thank you,

248
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,600
What do you really mean by this?

249
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,480
Nothing.

250
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,280
Are you and Luo Mingxi

251
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,720
planning something
during the birthday celebration?

252
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
Your Highness, you're joking.

253
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,680
It's the Crown Princess' conferring ceremony.

254
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,240
What can we do?

255
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,240
We can only watch from the sidelines, that's all.

256
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,360
You know that's not what I meant.

Are you...

258
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,520
Are you planning to regain your identity
as Di Ziyuan?

I call you Ren Anle

263
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,480
because you can keep being Ren Anle.

264
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,120

to do what you wish.

Di Ziyuan is Di Cheng'en now.

268
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,840
If you act recklessly,

269
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,520
it's deceiving the Emperor
no matter how you explain it.

Not to mention
that you're the daughter of a criminal.

273
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
So the Di family

274
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,280
has always been the criminals to you.

275
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,840
You have never trusted us at all.

276
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,640
There is strong evidence supporting this claim.

277
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,560
If so, I am determined to reveal the truth!

278
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,200
So you were planning

279
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,920
to clear your name
during Empress Dowager's birthday celebration.

280
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,680
I never intend to hide this matter from you.

281
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,280
Should I be glad that you didn't hide it from me

282
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,160
or should I be sad
that you're telling me about this?

283
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,040
This matter is putting me
in a difficult situation.

285
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,540

286

nor involved in the rebellion.

287

The reason I can share this with you

288
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,980
is because I trust the Crown Prince of Jing.

289
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,300

367
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,060
I wish Empress Dowager endless longevity

368
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,580
and blessings.

369
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,340
Your Majesty,

370
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,060
this box of pearls complements
your embroidered robe perfectly.

371
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,420
Look how round and full each pearl is.

372
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Excellent.

373
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,680
I pray that Your Majesty
has good fortune and a long life.

374
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,020
I haven't read many books,
so I only know these two lines.

375
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,340
I hope Your Majesty won't mind it.

376
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,340
I've also prepared a gift for you.

377
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,180
It may not be a valuable item.

378
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
But I heard Your Majesty
appreciates Buddhist scriptures.

379
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,820
So I hand-copied a scroll,

380
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,820
hoping Your Majesty can read it
in your leisure time.

381
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,180
This gift may be modest.

382
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,180
But I pray for blessings

383
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,660
and prosperity for Your Majesty.

384
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,140
You're thoughtful.

385
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,060
Accept it.

386
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,180
Ren Anle,

387
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,300
today is Empress Dowager's
birthday celebration

388
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,260
and the Crown Princess' conferment.

389
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,060
Nothing must go wrong.

390
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,060
Your Majesty, you can rest assured.

391
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,060
About you and the Crown Prince...

392
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,660
Regarding that,

393
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,140
we're not fated to be together.

394
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,820
I'm glad you understand that.

395
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,820
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

396
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,140
I won't do anything like snatching the groom.

397
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,020
(Today is the day.)

398
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
(After today,)

399
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,340
(I'll be the Crown Princess.)

400
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,980
Summon

401
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,060
Di Cheng'en!

402
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,860
Today is Empress Dowager's birthday banquet,

403
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,980
I wish Your Majesty

404
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,340
abundant blessings and good health.

405
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,940
That's thoughtful of you.

406
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,820
I, Di Cheng'en,

407
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,980
am a descendant of the Di family,
a daughter of a criminal,

408
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,460
and was originally considered a dead person.

409
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,700
It's because of His Majesty
and Her Majesty's grace

410
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,980
that I survived until this day.

411
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,180
On this day of the Empress Dowager's
birthday celebration,

412
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,460
I, Di Cheng'en,

413
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,180
am willing to confess my wrongs

414
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,100
as the daughter of the Di family
and express my gratitude for your benevolence.

415
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,220
The Di family is innocent!

416
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,180
Preposterous!

417
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,980
Who dares to make a commotion?

418
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,700
Your Majesty,

419
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,740
this humble subject, Zhong Hai,
pays respects to Your Majesty.

420
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,860
Zhong Hai,

421
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,180
isn't the case of the Zhong family
already settled?

422
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,340
I just granted you the reward
for loyalty and righteousness.

423
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,940
Why have you come forward?

424
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,580
Your Majesty,

425
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,300
I'm not here

426
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,460
for the Zhong family's case.

427
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,980
Your Majesty,

428
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,860
the Di family's army is not a rebel force.

429
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,980
They have been wronged.

430
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,100
Zhong Hai,

431
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,100
what nonsense are you talking about?

432
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,380
Every word I say is true

433
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,620
because

434
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,980
I am a former servant of the Di family!

435
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,620
The Di family's army has been wronged.

436
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,980
We were framed!

437
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,740
Today,

438
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,060
I am here to plead their case!

439
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,300
That's groundless.

440
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,700
Zhong Hai,

441
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,060
the Di family's army acted

442
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,220
without permission.

443
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,100
The truth is clear.

444
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,380
How can you say they were framed?

445
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,380
We didn't act without orders.

446
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,780
We only set out to Qingnan Mountain

447
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,220
after receiving the order.

448
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,060
At that time,

449
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,100
we received orders
to provide reinforcement to Qingnan City.

450
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,060
We dared not delay.

451
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,820
We traveled a long journey day and night

452
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,300
to reach the foot of Qingnan Mountain.

453
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,620
But when we arrived,

454
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,380
we noticed that the Northern Qin Army seemed

455
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
to have known about our whereabouts.

456
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,300
They had already set up an arrow formation,

457
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,820
forcing us

458
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,860
to retreat through the narrow passage

459
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,940
facing Qingnan City and seek reinforcement.

460
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,100
But little did we know

461
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,980
(that just after passing through the passage,)

462
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,100
(we fell into an ambush
by the guards of Qingnan City)

463
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,860
(before we could figure out the situation.)

464
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,220
(At that time,)

465
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,860
(it was very dark.)

466
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,980
(We couldn't see how many people)

467
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,580
(or arrows there were.)

468
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,460
(All we could hear was the sound
of arrows showering on us like rain.)

469
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,100
(There was no place to hide.)

470
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,060
We're the Di Troops!

471
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,460
(We shouted that we were from the Di Troops.)

472
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,340
(But no one paid any attention to us.)

473
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,620
(The arrows were released without stopping.)

474
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,980
(My fellow comrades all died.)

475
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,580
(The mountain was covered in their blood.)

476
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,460
Run!

477
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,100
(I was fortunate to escape death)

478
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,220
(because I was under the bodies
of my fellow soldiers.)

479
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,740
Your Majesty,

480
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,700
we are not rebels.

481
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,980
We have not betrayed the Jing State.

482
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,580
The Di Troops are innocent.

483
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,980
We are innocent!

484
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,220
Marquis Jing'an was innocent!

485
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,700
Your Majesty,

486
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,980
my fellow comrades died in vain.

487
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,580
We were wronged!

488
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,300
Please investigate this matter thoroughly,
Your Majesty.

489
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,500
Your Majesty, please investigate this matter.

490
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,180
Your Majesty,

491
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,220
I have something to ask Zhong Hai.

492
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,740
Go ahead.

493
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,340
Zhong Hai,

494
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,100
none of the eighty thousand soldiers
of Di Troops survived.

495
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,340
Now, you claim to be
a former servant of the Di family,

496
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,340
bringing up old grievances in public.

497
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,100
But, Zhong Hai,

498
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,820
you are already a criminal.

499
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,200
Your words are merely yours alone
and without proof.

500
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,460
How can we be convinced?

501
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,820
Your Majesty,

502
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,460
I disagree with His Highness.

503
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,220
Zhong Hai is a criminal

504
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,220
who has managed to live peacefully
for so many years.

505
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,940
Why would he suddenly come forward now

506
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
and get involved in this mess?

507
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,820
Moreover, treason is a serious crime.

508
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,940
If there is no injustice,

509
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,740
why would he step forward?

510
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,300
Your Majesty,

511
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,860
I believe there's something suspicious
about this case.

512
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,460
It requires further investigation.

513
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,700
What more is there to investigate?

514
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,740
The Crown Prince's words are reasonable.

515
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,740
No one can neither verify this person's identity

516
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,700
nor his words.

517
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,940
Today is my birthday celebration.

518
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,980
We can't tolerate this traitor causing trouble.

519
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,460
Guards,

520
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,940
take Zhong Hai away.

521
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,340
Your Majesty.

522
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,860
Your Majesty,

523
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,860
Zhong Hai may be a former soldier
of the Di family.

524
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,460
But he dares to come forward

525
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,460
and bring up old matters now.

526
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,860
There must be something fishy about this.

527
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,100
I implore Your Majesty to think it over.

528
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,340
Your Majesty,

529
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,980
I have a different opinion

530
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,580
from the Grand Chancellor of the Right.

531
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,220
As they say, the authorities
are often blinded by their position.

532
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,580
Perhaps

533
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,340
they think they were innocent.

534
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,460
Let me go! Your Majesty!

535
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,460
Your Majesty,

536
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,460
someone can prove my innocence!

537
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,980
He's right outside.

538
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,340
Please, Your Majesty.

539
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,100
Please let him enter.

540
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,700
Your Majesty.

541
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,260
Since someone can vouch for Zhong Hai's words,

542
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,140
why not question him openly?

543
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Crown Prince,

544
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,100
how can you really believe this traitor's words?

545
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,700
Grandmother,

546
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,940
we must clarify
now things have come to this point.

547
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,340
I, Zhang Jian, pay my respects to Your Majesty.

548
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,860
Your Majesty,

549
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,220
this person seems to be Gu Yunnian's guard.

550
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,100
Yes.

551
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,620
But ten years ago,

552
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,100
I was Gu Yunnian's deputy general.

553
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,980
Ten years ago, we were ordered
to ambush the Northern Qin Army.

554
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,420
But in reality, we were ambushing the Di Troops.

555
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,140
Your Majesty,

556
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,100
I have committed a serious crime.

557
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,300
Zhang Jian, please tell us in detail.

558
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,580
Your Majesty.

559
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,240
Ten years ago, Gu Yunnian called together
a group of men

560
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,620
to go to the narrow pass of Qingnan Mountain,

561
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,500
claiming it was to ambush the Northern Qin Army.

562
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,700
I was one of them.

563
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,900
That night,

564
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,460
he ordered us to guard mountain foot
and block the entrance.

565
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,180
He ordered that any enemy trying to break in,

566
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,420
regardless of what they said,

567
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,340
should be ignored and killed on the spot.

568
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,500
That day,

569
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,700
it was very dark.

570
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,860
We couldn't see the situation
on the mountain clearly.

571
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,700
But logically,

572
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,700
the only people that could come down
from Qingnan Mountain

573
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,660
were the Northern Qin Army.

574
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,100
With the military order we received,

575
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,700
we shot and killed

576
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,820
all the troops that came down

577
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,460
from the mountain that night.

578
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,300
Zhang Jian,

579
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
as you said,

580
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,880
you couldn't tell who they were
because it was dark.

581
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,460
How did you recognize

582
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,260
that they were the Di Troops?

583
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,140
When we were collecting the bodies,

584
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,180
we discovered the troops we ambushed and killed

585
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,100
were all wearing the Di Troops' armor.

586
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,720
I've committed a crime, and I am guilty!

587
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,500
Zhang Jian,

588
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,900
keep talking.

589
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,380
After that,

590
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,420
I became more suspicious about the situation.

591
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,940
But at that point,

592
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,700
I had to let it go.

593
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,140
Unexpectedly,

594
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,660
the next day, Your Majesty issued a decree,

595
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,380
ordering all the garrison troops
to persuade the Di Troops to surrender first

596
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,860
before executing them.

597
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,180
They chose death over betrayal.

598
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,140
Does such a treacherous army exist?

599
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,700
Your Majesty's decree

600
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
made me even more suspicious.

601
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,220
I also believed that I had killed
the enemy from Northern Qin.

602
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,360
They were only wearing the Di Troops' armor.

603
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,660
But

604
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,820
the days went by

605
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,380
as we guarded the border.

606
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,900
Yet, the Di Troops never came and attacked.

607
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,980
Instead, we received news

608
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,740
of the eighty thousand Di Troops

609
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,860
being ambushed and killed
by Northern Qin's cavalry

610
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,300
at the foot of Qingnan Mountain.

611
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
It was then

612
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,980
that I finally realized

613
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,820
that we had indeed killed the Di Troops.

614
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,060
We have wronged the eighty thousand soldiers.

615
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,580
This grave sin

616
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,340
is unforgivable.

617
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,340
Zhang Jian,

618
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,900
your words

619
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,500
could cause a huge uproar in the Jing State

620
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,900
and shake the whole country.

621
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,700
Can you take responsibility
for what you just said?

622
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,340
Your Highness,

623
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,300
every word I said is true.

624
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,180
I wouldn't dare to utter a single lie.

625
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,900
The heavens and earth can bear witness to it.

626
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,860
Very well.

627
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:52,900
Zhang Jian,

628
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,820
as you said,

629
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,020
back then,

630
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,420
you were just involved in a night battle

631
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,900
where you couldn't distinguish
between friend and foe.

632
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,900
Could you determine

633
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,740
whether the Di Troops
had conspired with the Northern Qin

634
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,460
and then fell out which led
to being ambushed and killed?

635
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,620
Or if they were caught in a trap
set by the Northern Qin

636
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,340
after entering the Northwest?

637
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,300
These two scenarios are plausible.

638
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,420
Can you clarify that?

639
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,900
(The reason I can share this with you)

640
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,140
is because I trust the Crown Prince of Jing.

641
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,660
I only believe in evidence.

642
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,660
Your Highness, you have a point.

643
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,180
I indeed

644
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,220
can't tell what the situation was like
at that time.

645
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,740
Very good.

646
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,500
You didn't try to deceive us.

647
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
Let me put it another way.

648
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,180
Even if what you said is true,

649
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,620
that the Di Troops
were accidentally killed by you,

650
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,540
it is possible that Gu Yunnian

651
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,740
mistakenly believed
that the Northern Qin intended to attack the city.

652
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,940
So he led the troops to battle

653
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,260
and accidentally killed the Di Troops.

654
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,460
There are countless possibilities,

655
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,380
and it's not enough to prove
it was a deliberate murder.

656
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,220
Your Majesty,

657
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,620
Gu Yunnian

658
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,940
ambushed and killed the Di Troops

659
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,980
because he received a secret letter
from the capital.

660
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,780
Zhang Jian,

661
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,380
how can you tell that the letter
was from the capital?

662
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,180
And how can you be sure

663
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,260
that Gu Yunnian ambushed
and killed the Di Troops

664
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,900
because of that letter?

665
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,540
I'm not sure

666
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,740
about the content of the letter.

667
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,500
Zhang Jian,

668
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,020
you were merely a guard.

669
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,860
How dare you speak such reckless words!

670
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,740
What secret letter?

671
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,340
It's all nonsense!

672
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,380
Who else knows about this matter,

673
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,940
and who else witnessed it with you?

674
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,420
Indeed, only I saw it.

675
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
As for the letter,

676
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,500
Gu Yunnian had already burned it back then.

677
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
Outrageous!

678
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,620
I think

679
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,620
you are clearly lying!

680
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,460
No!

681
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,180
I'm not lying.

682
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,340
Everything I said is true.

683
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,700
I implore His Majesty and Empress Dowager
to investigate this matter.

684
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:34,940
Your Majesty,

685
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,540
since this matter involves Gu Yunnian,

686
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,260
why not bring him here

687
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,100
and let him confront Zhang Jian face-to-face?

688
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,700
Permitted.

689
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,860
Emperor,

690
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,120
do you also believe in this barbarian's words?

691
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,700
Your Majesty,

692
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,540
as the Crown Prince said earlier,

693
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,860
this matter has come to a point

694
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,820
where we must confront it head-on.
