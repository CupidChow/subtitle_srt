and the internal ledger went.

57
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,380
hands all the problems to me.

58

successfully passed the first round.)

59

pave the way for them next.

61
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,940
Yes, and it's the right time now.

62
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,660
Qianyue Pavilion looked into Jiangnan

63
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,820
and found out Zhong Liwen
is good at bribery and blackmail.

64
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,260
Records of corruption
are kept in an internal ledger.

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,820
We investigated the internal ledger before.

66
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,820
But because Zhong Liwen was too careful

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,380
and Jiangnan isn't our territory,

68
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,580
we had trouble succeeding.

The pendant appeared in Mutian Prefecture.

72
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,260
It is said to have been pawned
by a man surnamed Zhong.

73

78
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,700
describe it wrongly?

81

Coming from the army,

82
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,260
he should have
strong anti-reconnaissance capability.

83

The Di family's coin
is no ordinary thing after all.

84
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,140
If they did find out it,

189
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,740
then...

190
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,620
No way.

191
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,500
I must check it out.

192
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,260
You seem to be in a hurry, Official Zhong.

193
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,020
Looks like I came over at a bad time.

194
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,100
I didn't expect you to visit me all of a sudden,
Your Highness.

195
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,980
Please forgive me.

196
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,500
Save the etiquette.

197
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,620
This way, please.

198
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,500
Enjoy.

199
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,860
I wonder why you're here,

200
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,260
Your Highness.

201
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,260
I came to Jiangnan

202
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
just to solve the flood.

203
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
It's inevitable that I need to rely on you.

204
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,980
So I would like to ask you for more help.

205
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,020
In the future,

206
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,220
I can report back to His Majesty.

207
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,340
I, Zhong Liwen,

208
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,620
and the 25 staff of Mutian Prefecture under me

209
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,460
are at your disposal.

210
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,860
We're at your beck and call.

211
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,020
Alright.

212
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,340
Sit.

213
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,220
Thank you, Your Highness.

214
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,460
Official Zhong.

215
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,140
The source of Jiangnan's flood

216
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,460
is the weak dam.

217
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
I've tracked down

218
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,100
the river workers who built the dam last year.

219
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,100
Your Highness, these...

220
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,180
If I hadn't found out about it,

221
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,820
for how long did you plan
to hide this from me?

222
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,180
What do you mean, Your Highness?

223
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,460
Official Zhong.

224
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,460
Your tea looks good.

225
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,820
Come on.

226
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,460
Tell me

227
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,860
where you got it.

228
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,740
Sit.

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
I want to know more about Jiangnan

230
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,540
from you.

231
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,620
You'll tell me, right?

232
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,340
Yes.

233
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,660
I will

234
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,540
tell you everything I know.

235
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,870
[Zhao Manor Copper Mine]

236
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,540
Sir.

237
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,700
Have we been set up?

238
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,140
Sir.

239
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,100
It's rare to see bandits

240
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,420
attacking an imperial mine.

241
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,460
Bandits versus pirates.

242
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,460
Yuanqin.

243
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,860
Who do you think will win?

244
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,420
Yuanshu.

245
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,700
Why don't you give it a shot?

246
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:34,980
Get ready!

247
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,100
-Miss!
-Miss!

248
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,500
Don't shoot.

249
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,740
We're not bandits.

250
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,020
We're officers of Mutian Prefecture.

251
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,140
You're officers?

252
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,500
That makes us

253
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,140
heavenly troops sent by the Jade Emperor.

254
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,140
Fire!

255
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,020
Miss!

256
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,780
Miss!

257
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,860
Miss!

258
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,020
We-We're really officials
from Mutian Prefecture.

259
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,140
Nonsense.

260
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,020
Why would officers dress like bandits

261
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,140
and come to Zhao Manor?

262
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,220
I'm not talking nonsense.

263
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,340
Miss.

264
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm a private adviser of Mutian Prefecture.

265
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,500
Our governor received a tip-off

266
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,140
that bandits are going
to rob Zhao Village tonight.

267
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
That's why we came in disguise.

268
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,620
It's a misunderstanding.

269
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,540
It's a misunderstanding, miss.

270
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,020
Yes.

271
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,860
Really?

272
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,620
Are you really officers?

273
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,300
General.

274
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,380
If you don't believe us,

275
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,020
you can follow us back to Mutian Prefecture

276
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,540
and ask Official Zhong.

277
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,860
Yuanshu.

278
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,620
Get someone to go to Mutian Prefecture and ask.

279
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,740
Your Highness.

280
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,860
We caught a gang of bandits

281
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,100
in Zhao Manor in the south of the city.

282
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,860
Official Ren doesn't know what to do,

283
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,540
so she asked me to ask you.

284
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,100
Official Zhong.

285
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,100
It's a surprise to me

286
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
that there are bandits in Jiangnan.

287
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,460
I-I'm sorry.

288
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,140
These bandits have shown up

289
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,420
because of the recent flood.

290
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,460
These bandits usually...

291
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,740
Official Zhong, in your opinion,

292
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,700
what should we do with them?

293
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
These bandits

294
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,100
burned, killed, looted,
and commit all sorts of crimes.

295
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,860
We should

296
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,900
get rid of them.

297
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,660
Alright.

298
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,100
Now that we got your approval,

299
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,980
it makes things easier for Official Ren and me.

300
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,940
Your Highness.

301
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,020
I'll go to the south of the city
and deal with this myself.

302
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,260
It's late.

303
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,900
You don't need to see me off, Official Zhong.

304
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,300
Please take care, Your Highness.

305
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:54,820
Sir.

306
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,780
I can't believe the crown prince

307
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,580
made me endure this

308
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,660
helplessly.

309
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,540
It seems I can't keep these officers anymore.

310
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,180
Sir.

311
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,540
Where are you going?

312
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,660
We can't hide the river workers anymore.

313
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,540
I need to check

314
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,580
if the internal ledger is safe.

315
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,780
I'll be right back.

316
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,180
Guard the door.

317
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,420
The rest of you are going in with us.

318
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,900
Oh, no. I fell into the trap.

319
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,780
Thank you, Official Zhong.

320
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,180
Your Highness.

321
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,820
Official Ren.

322
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,380
This is my wives' ledger.

323
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,180
Your Highness, Official Ren, are you

324
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,500
interested in this too?

325
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,540
Your Highness, if you don't believe me,

326
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,460
you can check it yourself.

327
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,520
[Ledger]

328
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,540
Wen Shuo, take a look at it.

329
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,220
Arrest Zhong Liwen.

330
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,460
Lock him up for trial.

331
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,540
Yes.

332
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,300
Your Highness.

333
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,300
You can't arrest me.

334
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,500
I'm the governor of Mutian Prefecture.

335
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,220
Let me go!

336
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,060
Let go of me!

337
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,060
Let me go!

338
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm the governor of Mutian Prefecture.

339
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,540
Zhong Liwen.

340
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,220
Take a good look

341
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,140
at what this is.

342
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,340
It's the disaster relief letter
of me and my colleagues.

343
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,820
What are you trying to say with this,

344
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,540
Your Highness?

345
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,740
The word "Xue" on this letter

346
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,220
and the word "Cui" on this ledger

347
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,780
share an identical writing style.

348
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,540
The tail was extended.

349
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,220
And it was written in a hurry.

350
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,340
And the character "Wen"

351
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,060
is the same one you used

352
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,260
in your invitation to His Highness.

353
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,740
Official Zhong.

354
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,700
How do you explain this?

355
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,980
My wife is illiterate.

356
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,980
I had someone to do the bookkeeping.

357
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,260
What's wrong with that?

358
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,700
Your Highness.

359
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,220
I have ascertained

360
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,220
that this ledger

361
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,140
contains the names of 12 concubines.

362
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,220
And the handwriting of these 12 concubines

363
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,780
is identical to the handwriting
of the 12 officials

364
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,340
on the document.

365
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,140
Official Zhong, have you forgotten

366
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,340
what I said yesterday?

367
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,820
This is my brother who has an unequaled memory.

368
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,060
You can only blame yourself for overthinking

369
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,140
and holding that treacherous banquet

370
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,300
at Wangjiang Terrace.

371
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,060
Official Ren.

372
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Ren Anle.

373
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,820
If it weren't for you...

374
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,300
Zhong Liwen.

375
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,700
These 12 people are the same officials

376
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,820
involved in the dam construction last year.

377
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,780
How dare you say it's not your internal ledger!

378
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,780
Take him away.

379
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,700
Yes.

380
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,420
Move.

381
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,060
I can't believe

382
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,980
24 people were sent.

383
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,140
They're heading

384
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
to the county magistrate
near Mutian Prefecture to arrest them.

385
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,860
Besides Zhong Liwen,

386
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,340
12 other officers are involved.

387
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,340
When they're back,

388
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,490
the jail's going to be full.

389
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,580
Mutian Prefecture isn't a big place,

390
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,580
but there are so many corrupt officials.

391
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,540
When the leader sets a bad example,
their followers will follow suit.

392
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,820
Unlike me.

393
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,460
With His Highness as an example,

394
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,540
I can only become a charming man.

395
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,860
Miss Yuanqin.

396
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,980
I brought this for you.

397
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,060
A charming man?

398
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,260
You?

399
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,700
Mr. Wen, you're still young.

400
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,740
After gaining some experience,

401
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
you'll make great achievements.

402
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,220
Yes.

403
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,140
I'm just a little young.

404
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,260
But my mind...

405
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,820
But

406
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,060
you're rather naive

407
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,820
and childish indeed.

408
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,980
Wait for me.

409
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,340
The flood receded
and corrupt officials have fallen.

410
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,980
I'd like to see

411
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,220
what the people of Mutian Prefecture

412
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,300
wished for.

413
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,300
The flood

414
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
has killed and injured many this year.

415
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,060
"May the dam be solid forever,
so we'll never suffer again.

416
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,780
The river will always be clear
and the world will always be prosperous."

417
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,180
That reminds me
of the blood letter written by the people.

418
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,180
Everything is still fresh in my mind.

419
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,700
It's still shocking to recall it now.

420
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,700
Each of these lanterns

421
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,980
was once a living person.

422
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,420
It's a good thing that someone

423
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
still remembers and misses them.

424
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,180
There is light

425
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,020
at the end of the tunnel.

426
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,500
But...

427
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,020
Your Highness.

428
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,420
I've only joined Court of Judicial Review
for a few months

429
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,220
and already found out
many miscarriages of justice.

430
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,540
Mutian Prefecture alone

431
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,180
was already so problematic.

432
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,300
I wonder when

433
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,820
people of the Jing State

434
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,420
get to have an incorruptible country.

435
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,420
It will take many years

436
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,340
to have an incorruptible country.

437
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,220
It doesn't happen overnight.

438
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,420
But Your Highness,

439
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,420
some people are alone for years

440
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,180
and never get their cases cleared.

441
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,900
No one remembers or cares about them.

442
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,500
How long will those people have to wait?

443
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,220
I can't answer your question.

444
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,460
But Anle,

445
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,260
with someone like you
getting rid of corruption in the Jing State,

446
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,220
I believe the world

447
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,500
will one day be free of corruption.

448
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,660
Besides,

449
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,940
you're not alone.

450
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,740
No matter when,

451
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,020
you and I are in the same boat.

452
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,140
I don't want to be in the same boat with you.

453
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,420
More like the same bed.

454
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,100
Watch out!

455
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,100
Your Highness.

456
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,420
You're shy.

457
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,780
Ren Anle.

458
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,900
Hit me then.

459
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,020
Hit me.

460
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,020
Hit me...

461
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,660
Ridiculous.

462
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,100
(What are you so happy about?)

463
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,700
Anle.

464
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,460
You're amazing.

465
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,540
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

466
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,180
Isn't Wen Shuo

467
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
the biggest contributor today?

468
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,020
You got Wen Shuo

469
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,260
involved in the first place.

470
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,300
You know he's smart and has a good memory.

471
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,700
So he would be of great help.

472
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,940
So on our trip to Jiangnan,

473
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,020
you set me up to take him with me

474
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,700
and asked Yuanqin to test him.

475
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,260
That's what made him accomplish so many things.

476
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,180
That's because you have nurtured Wen Shuo well.

477
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
It's the first time I've seen someone

478
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
who can remember

479
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,220
names and handwriting that well.

480
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,500
Actually,

481
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,940
aren't you playing a game too?

482
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,420
Since investigating the river workers,

483
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,700
you've been trying to get Zhong Liwen

484
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,020
to fall into your trap.

485
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
It's because I have a smart partner

486
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,460
like you

487
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,020
that I don't have to do a one-man show.

488
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,500
After all, it took you a lot of effort

489
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,420
to pick me and allow me to stay by your side.

490
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,540
No.

491
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,700
Ren Anle.

492
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,660
You're actually

493
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,900
the only accident.

494
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,700
Doesn't the most perfect crown prince

495
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,180
turn every accident

496
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,420
into a win?

497
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,700
Are you happy

498
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,940
that I saw through you?

499
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,860
[Mutian Prefectural Government Office]

500
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,660
Ren An...

501
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,180
Wen Shuo.

502
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,180
Follow me to the court later.

503
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,180
Sure, Your Highness.

504
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,420
Your Highness.

505
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,180
Do you feel like someone's missing?

506
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,180
The trial is about to begin.

507
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,540
Stop grinning.

508
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,700
The ministers have submitted their memorials
to His Majesty recently.

509
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,500
And Zhong Liwen
haven't sent us a letter for so long.

510
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,020
Did something

511
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,500
go wrong in Jiangnan?

512
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,180
If Crown Prince tracked him down,

513
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,460
would it implicate us?

514
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,900
You never know.

515
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,700
It seems

516
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,500
we can only use that method again.

517
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,740
Dear, please.

518
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,100
Well...

519
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,020
Aren't you afraid he'll show mercy again?

520
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,020
I know him

521
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,460
better than you.

522
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,260
He returned the favor to Crown Prince last time.

523
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,260
If he doesn't get the job done this time,

524
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,540
he won't get to make it out alive and see me.

525
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,260
Yuanqin, why is it so noisy outside?

526
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,500
Why don't you check it out?

527
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,220
I heard from the servants

528
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,260
that His Highness

529
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,500
rebutted the officials into silence.

530
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,460
They started the trial?

531
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,260
Yes.

532
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,540
This morning,

533
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,980
His Highness heard that you refused

534
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,100
to go to the trial with him,

535
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,020
so he stood alone outside for a long time
before leaving.

536
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,740
He's doing his job as the crown prince.

537
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
Why should I meddle?

538
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,300
If it weren't for you,

539
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,020
His Highness' trip to Mutian Prefecture

540
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,260
wouldn't be so fruitful.

541
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,580
By the way,

542
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,340
how's the investigation
with the lotus silver pendant?

543
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,020
Yuanshu and I have been asking around these days.

544
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,220
We eventually concluded

545
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,700
that a man surnamed Zhong pawned it.

546
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,300
But the man surnamed Zhong acted alone.

547
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,500
We don't have any leads on him yet.

548
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,940
It seems one of us

549
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,980
will never get what we want.

550
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,060
No wonder they said

551
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,740
once Zhong Liwen is brought down,

552
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,060
the whole Jiangnan won't starve.

553
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,300
This is no residence.

554
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,060
A corrupt official
who extracts money from the people

555
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,820
deserves to die.

556
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,020
According to their servants,

557
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Zhong Liwen never let anyone go near his study.

558
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,540
There's a good chance
the name list is hidden in there.

559
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,780
Leave it to me.

560
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,820
Possess the three qualities
and let the divinatory symbols overlap...

561
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,340
-It's you?
-It's you?

562
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,780
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

563
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,500
It's painful.

564
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,500
Zhong Liwen is a corrupt official.

565
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,820
But he's a man of culture.

566
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,060
I thought he'd have

567
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,500
many out-of-print books in his study,

568
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,700
so I came over to have a look.

569
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,340
What about you?

570
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,780
You don't look like a book lover.

571
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,060
You came here for no reason.

572
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,300
Are you here to find...

573
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,140
She's finding her brother.

574
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Find... your brother?

575
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,980
Yes.

576
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,260
Is...

577
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,140
Is your brother a servant here?

578
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,300
It's none of your business.

579
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,140
You're really vulgar.

580
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
The book you're holding...

581
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,060
I've only read this book for a while,

582
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,300
but I find it interesting.

583
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,540
Miss Yuanqin, we indeed share the same interests.

584
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,260
I thought of sharing it with you.

585
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,740
But it's too dark in here.

586
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,780
Why don't we read it outside?

587
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,620
Sure.

588
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,820
I think this is a really good line.

589
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,540
Look.

590
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,060
Those 80,000 men make a long list.

591
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,780
Where can it be?

592
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:22,460
[Wangjiang Terrace]

593
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Are you done?

594
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,300
Yes.

595
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,060
We have solid evidence of Zhong Liwen's

596
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,540
embezzlement of disaster relief food
and river dam funds.

597
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,820
He has been sentenced to beheading in autumn.

598
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,820
The remaining officials
have been dismissed and prosecuted.

599
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,100
And the squires' fortunes

600
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,820
are confiscated

601
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,340
to be used for disaster relief.

602
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,580
You worked so quickly.

603
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,420
Anle.

604
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,020
You weren't idle either.

605
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,580
I'm good

606
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
at making things easier for you.

607
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,460
The disaster relief fund

608
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,900
is already on its way.

609
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,100
And the disaster victims
can have some temporary respite.

610
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,100
If you ask me,

611
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,540
the court doesn't have to

612
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,100
send any relief fund.

613
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,060
You've taken care of everything,

614
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,580
haven't you?

615
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,540
Anle.

616
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,100
It's not me.

617
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,780
It's us.

618
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,260
Speaking of which,

619
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,540
I have something to say.

620
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Since I helped you

621
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,780
solve such a big case,

622
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
shouldn't my rank in Crown Prince's Residence

623
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,100
increase by three ranks?

624
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,660
Let me think.

625
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,100
Beauty...

626
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,180
Shouldn't I be

627
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,100
Lady of Excellent Beauty now?

628
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,380
It seems

629
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,580
that I'm only one step away
from being Crown Princess.

630
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,540
Do you really think so?

631
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,180
No matter what I think,

632
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,780
you still have

633
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,380
someone you need to get rid of, don't you?

634
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:15,020
[Mutian Prefecture]

635
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,620
[Three days later]

636
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,500
What's on your mind, Your Highness?

637
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,740
Nothing's on my mind.

638
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,260
Let me guess.

639
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,380
You're probably thinking,

640
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
"Ren Anle

641
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,580
wants to stay here a few more days.

642
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
But I won't give her what she wants.

643
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,660
I'll anger her." Right?

644
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,020
No.

645
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,900
No?

646
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,780
Then you must be thinking,

647
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,620
"After we get back to the capital,

648
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,260
I'll throw Ren Anle

649
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,740
into the battle for the title of crown princess

650
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,100
and watch them fight like crickets.

651
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,780
How fun would that be?" Right?

652
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,540
That's not it.

653
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,540
I got it.

654
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,060
You must be thinking,

655
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,100
"After I get back to the capital,

656
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,420
I'll make Ren Anle Crown Princess."

657
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,580
Or are you

658
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,580
thinking the other way around?

659
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,540
"After I get back to the capital,

660
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,700
I'll get rid of Ren Anle."

661
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,420
You always think I'm thinking about Ren Anle.

662
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,620
Shouldn't you?

663
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,380
Yes.

664
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,500
I tell myself all the time

665
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,620
that I shouldn't.

666
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,060
You don't have to.

667
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,540
Then tell me

668
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,980
why you're in a hurry to go back to the capital.

669
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,300
As you suggested,

670
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,980
I'll take care of that restless person.

671
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,580
Why won't you stay in Jiangnan

672
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
and wait for your chance?

673
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,780
The new governor is about to take office.

674
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,940
He could get in trouble

if the assassination
happened in Mutian Prefecture.

676
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,140

What's on your mind?

700
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,900
I'm thinking

701
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,700
that it's a blessing

702
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
to the Han family and the Jing State

703
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,780
that these people

704
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,260
have a diligent and loving crown prince like you.

705

The Di family gave up half of their land

706

to the Han family to end the war.

707
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,180
If Di Shengtian could see this,

708
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,420
I'm sure she wouldn't regret it.

709
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,100
You're right.

710
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,420
There may never be

713
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,020
can usher in a peaceful and prosperous era.

a safe journey back to the capital.
