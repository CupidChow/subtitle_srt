Gu Qishan

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,390
will be exiled instead.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,390
It's all right. There's still plenty of time.

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,990
But Your Highness,

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,340
you feel guilty about it

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,580
and I have nothing to lose, anyway.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,110
Well, I assume this meal

32
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,500
will be on you today.

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,670
Take your seat.

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,030
Today,

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,910
I've arranged something great for you.

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,630
Where are you?

37
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,270
Coming.

38
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,830
Here I am.

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,830
Look.

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,390
Sorry for being late.

41
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,900
Please forgive me, Your Highness, Official Ren.

42
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,900
It's all right, you're just in time.

43
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,350
I wanted to have a private moment with you,

44
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,740
but you might get embarrassed, so...

45
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,510
Considerate, aren't I?

46
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,390
What would you like to listen to today?

47
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,670
Anything.

48
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,860
I heard that people are talking about this story

49
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,230
called "The Pretty Pirate Ren Anle

50
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,180
Courts the Crown Prince
with Thirty Thousand Naval Forces".

51
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,020
Can you do this?

52
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,350
That book has been selling like hotcakes,

53
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,900
and I haven't gotten my hands on it yet.

54
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,700
Instead,

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,860
how about I tell you the story

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,990
of General Anning, the Defender of the Borders

57
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,790
and Conqueror of the Northwest?

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,350
What do you say?

59
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,180
We'll listen to that.

60
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,550
Wonderful.

61
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,550
Anle is here,

62
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,620
but you want Anning.

63
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,270
The current emperor has a daughter

64
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,900
whose bravery and prowess rival those of a man.

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,990
Out in the war field, she has never lost a battle.

66
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,460
She is Anning, the Eldest Princess.

67
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,140
Princess Anning has always loved martial arts.

68
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,390
At the age of 12, during the
annual Fall Hunt Banquet,

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,180
she emerged victorious among her contenders.

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,900
Overjoyed, His Majesty asked what she wanted.

71
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,070
Instead of riches and gold

72
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,270
or expensive silk clothes,

73
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,180
Princess Anning requested to
be deployed to the Northwest...

74
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,900
Your Highness.

75
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,140
-To guard the borders.
-Let's have a drink.

76
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,550
While the princess's request seemed reasonable...

77
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,460
Listen attentively.

78
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,230
After all, the Jing State was founded by warriors,

79
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,270
and the founding emperor...

80
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,790
It's a boring story.

81
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,270
What's there to listen?

82
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,550
It's still better than some stories

83
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,580
laden with exaggerated and fabricated content.

84
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,990
During that, men fought bloody battles,

85
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,990
so did many women.

86
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,140
On the borders of our state, however,

87
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,020
life is still hard.

88
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,110
Why?

89
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,420
For you.

90
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,270
Thank you, Your Highness.

91
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,020
Continue.

92
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,420
Don't stop, no matter what happens.

93
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,420
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,030
The Northwest borders Northern Qin.

95
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,710
Two states have ceased fire for years,

96
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,740
the borders were often plagued by rogue bandits.

97
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,590
Over the past six years,

98
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,230
Princess Anning's bravery

99
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,300
and constant victories in battle

100
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,230
secured peace among the people.

101
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,150
And, on that fateful day,

102
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,230
some bandits from Northern Qin struck again.

103
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,380
Princess Anning rode her steed,
rushing to the battlefield.

104
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,710
Such high praises.

105
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,990
Don't tell me he's actually the royal storyteller.

106
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
There's no need for envy.

107
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,860
Heroines like you two should respect each other.

108
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,300
Instead of having respect for me,

109
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,710
you want me to respect her?

110
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,740
(She was quite elegant, though.)

111
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,030
(She wore a golden crown of condor wings)

112
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,740
(and a silver-red battle cloak.)

113
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
(She rode her ebony war horse)

114
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,710
(and hold her scimitar.)

115
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,860
(As she saw the bandits,)

116
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,940
(she remained as polite as ever,)

117
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,260
presenting the demeanor of our state.

118
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,990
[Anning, Princess of Jing]
So, you're Ren Anle?

119
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,230
Anning?

120
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,990
Why are you back?

121
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,110
We'll settle your scores later.

122
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,710
Could she be the legendary...

123
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,550
The legendary Princess Anning.

124
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,710
I didn't expect her

125
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,260
to be ruder than what the stories tell.

126
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,110
You're asking for this.

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,940
Anning!

128
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,500
Stop this!

129
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,940
Out of my way!

130
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,620
I am the Crown Prince.

131
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,110
I only listen to the General.

132
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,030
I don't want to hurt you.

133
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,590
See?

134
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,030
The Crown Prince would rather protect me, not you.

135
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,990
You are shameless.

136
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,790
We told you not to stop, no matter what happens.

137
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,790
Go on.

138
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,420
(Despite her beaming smile,)

139
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,030
Princess Anning showed no mercy.

140
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,990
(She...)

141
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,590
(She rode her horse and hold her scimitar,)

142
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,590
(toward the bandits bravely,)

143
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,420
(She...)

144
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,860
(Taking cover from the glint of her scimitar,)

145
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,110
(she waved her left arm)

146
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,110
(and punched hard)

147
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,860
(directly against the bandit's chest.)

148
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,740
Where's your beaming smile?

149
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,350
Don't believe his exaggerated story.

150
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,230
All fight and no talk.

151
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,420
Where's your noble demeanor?

152
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,790
When we deal with bandits,

153
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,860
we don't show mercy.

154
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,470
What did you say, bandits?

155
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,990
I am a palace official.

156
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,990
Is that so?

157
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,110
On my way here, I heard so much

158
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,860
about you harassing the Crown Prince.

159
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,590
What a coincidence!

160
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,990
I also heard many tall tales
about your so-called exploits.

161
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,350
I have no need for a false reputation.

162
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,230
I only want your life.

163
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,670
My life is worth a fortune.

164
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,550
I'm afraid you'll have to
exchange it with your life.

165
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,030
Princess Anning, follow me if you dare.

166
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,230
Stop!

167
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,710
General!

168
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,660
Nice fight.

169
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,780
It was exhilarating.

170
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,540
I'm Anle.

171
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,660
I'm Anning.

172
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,660
I wasn't able to stop the Crown Prince.

173
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,590
You may punish me, General.

174
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,230
Given his martial abilities,

175
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,110
you did a good job stalling him for minutes.

176
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,990
You're just back from the borders for debriefing,

177
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,230
but before seeing His Majesty,

178
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,430
you caused quite a scene.

179
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,660
Isn't it appropriate?

180
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,350
Yeah.

181
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,900
I thought only my presence

182
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,540
would bring chaos and calamity

183
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,430
wherever I go.

184
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,780
Only your presence?

185
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,430
Disagree?

186
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,020
Of course.

187
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,780
Let's have another round.

Cheers.

194
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,780
How many times have you scared
the bandits off till they wet their pants?

195
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,900
Don't mention it. Too many times.

196
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,140

do men admire you?

202
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,990
Wrong question.

203
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,860
Actually, I don't care

204
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,500
if men admire me.

205
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,310
I chose a life of war and battles

206
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,740
for my own sake and my nation's peace.

207
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,230
Well, I'm different.

208

You may not be interested
in defending the borders,

in the face of danger.

you smashed a pleasure house

Why would I get a husband?

251
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,110
Can a husband lead an army to war

252
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,310
or can he rule the nation?

become so invested

287
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,510
in choosing a consort

the Crown Prince is essential to our state.

Unless he gets married,

293
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,390
our state would remain shaky.

294
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,900
For the late emperor's will,

295
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,510
the Crown Princess doesn't get married,

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,510
is to select an eligible lady

Your Majesty,

307
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,390
the final decision lies with His Highness.

nothing has changed.

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,430
I'd have recommended her name as well.

316
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,910

317
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,430
that Marquis Zhongyi's daughter was recommended.

he even colluded with ministers of Works.

And apparently, he's living in the lap of luxury.

he's not going to let you off.

That's right.

she will be your best cover.

In that case,

358
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,420
it'll be harder for anyone

He's gathered the ministers to pressure Han Ye,

and instigated the Empress Dowager

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,380
to make his daughter the Crown Princess.

365
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,070
Gu Yunnian sure has everything laid out.

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,550
By doing so,

367
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,070
he can target you

If we can get the fake Di Ziyuan here,

372
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,030
we may benefit from Han Ye's obsession.

373
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,470
The more chaos, the better.

374
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,380
I asked to marry Han Ye with 30,000 naval forces

375
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,790
and no one else should be his wife.

376
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,270
[Jingxin Hall]

377
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,270
[Sun Yujun, Empress Dowager of Jing]

378
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,580
Mother.

379
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,060
The servants always told me

380
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,420
that you were busy with national matters.

381
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,710
Very well,

382
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,180
but why can't you take care of family business?

383
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,950
I have not visited you lately, Mother.

384
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,950
That's because...

385
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,950
I mean,

386
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,950
the Crown Prince is in his twenties,
and he's still not married.

387
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,140
His marriage is

388
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,990
almost the biggest joke in our state.

389
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,540
It's not that I don't want to urge him.

390
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,190
But over the years,

391
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,670
he has been using the late emperor's will

392
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,430
as his excuse for rejection.

393
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,060
I can't refute that.

394
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,380
He may be insensible.

395
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,140
Don't tell me you are, too.

396
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,670
Your father was foolish enough

397
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,910
to sign a random marriage contract.

398
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,820
Are you as foolish as he was?

399
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,670
The Crown Prince's marriage
concerns our family and our state.

400
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,140
A woman from the Di family can't hold him up.

401
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,670
Matron Sun.

402
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
[Daughter of the Hanlin Academy Chancellor]
All eligible noble young ladies

403
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,820
and daughters of ministers in the capital...

404
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,910
All their engagement cards are here.

405
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,990
I'm sure we'll find

406
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,140
a Crown Princess from here.

407
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,300
[Daughter of the Vice Minister of Personnel]
Here are all the eligible ladies in the state.

408
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,300
Pick one.

409
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,430
Son,

410
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,670
what do you mean?

411
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,540
Regarding my marriage,

412
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,580
I will honor the promise my grandfather made.

413
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,380
Honor his promise?

414
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,300
You're living happily but what about me?

415
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,780
You know what?

416
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,060
Everyone has been pressuring me lately.

417
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,190
They're asking me

418
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,780
why I'm not finding you a wife!

419
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,620
I have failed you as a son.

420
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,620
Sorry for the disturbance I've caused you.

421
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,820
You have failed me!

422
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,990
Is there anyone else in this world

423
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,100
around your age

424
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,300
who refuses to get married?

425
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,140
You are the Crown Prince.

426
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,910
You were born into royalty,

427
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,140
so our family matters concern the nation too.

428
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,270
You don't want to get married?

429
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,820
What if our people call you a disloyal son?

430
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,380
I want to marry Di Ziyuan

431
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,820
to fulfill my grandfather's wish.

432
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,060
And that's my duty as the Crown Prince.

433
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,030
As you just said, Your Majesty,

434
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,820
I was born into royalty,

435
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,540
so our family matters concern the nation too.

436
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,380
I'm also remaining loyal to my nation.

437
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,340
Shut up!

438
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,910
Please let me marry who I want, Your Majesty.

439
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Get out!

440
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,290
[Yuchen Hall]

441
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,910
Your Highness.

442
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,380
I am absolutely determined
to honor my grandfather's promise.

443
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,060
Your Majesty.

444
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,910
Please have some tea.

445
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Your Highness, when you need a wife,

446
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,780
you can't forget me,

447
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,820
who asked to marry you with my navy.

448
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,060
Your Highness, I'm here to solve your worries.

449
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,780
I'm Ren Anle from the Court of Judicial Review.

450
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,620
Greetings, Your Majesty.

451
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,910
Rise.

452
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,780
What is it, Official Ren?

453
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,230
I'm here to beg for forgiveness.

454
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,230
What wrong have you done?

455
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,230
I was desperate to please His Highness

456
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,140
by solving the case,

457
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,990
and I captured the Marquis Zhongyi's son.

458
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,380
I got myself into such huge trouble.

459
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,780
I beg for your forgiveness, Your Majesty,

460
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,820
for I'm new here
with little knowledge of officialdom.

461
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,990
The Court of Judicial Review handles all cases

462
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,470
and judges what's right or wrong.

463
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,950
Since you were enforcing the law,
you did nothing wrong.

464
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,380
Your Majesty, are you praising me?

465
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,580
So, I don't need to apologize, huh?

466
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

467
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,780
Why do you think

468
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,470
that I would punish you?

469
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,060
I heard that Marquis Zhongyi

470
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,140
would marry his daughter to His Highness.

471
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,230
So I was thinking,

472
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,620
only am I losing a potential husband,

473
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,950
I have also offended Marquis Zhongyi.

474
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,100
Isn't it just like,

475
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,380
a wild goose chase

476
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,860
that ends up in a double loss?

477
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,540
So...

478
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,230
Days ago, you asked to marry my son

479
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,620
but it didn't turn out well.

480
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,950
You solved the cheating case perfectly, though.

481
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,620
Why would I blame you?

482
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,470
In fact, I think

483
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,910
you're a talented official.

484
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
No, no.

485
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,950
I became an official

486
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,470
just to be good enough for His Highness.

487
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,990
Now, I just heard

488
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,620
that someone else might marry him.

489
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,470
So I rushed here immediately.

490
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,470
If I were to choose,

491
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,380
I do think

492
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,780
you're a perfect wife for him.

493
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,470
But it's a pity

494
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,620
that the decision

495
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,910
lies with the Crown Prince himself.

496
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,380
Now, I'm willing to marry him,

497
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,300
but the Crown Prince isn't willing to marry me.

498
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,300
How about

499
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,910
we organize a Crown Princess selection instead?

500
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,950
Count me in,

501
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,140
as well as Di Ziyuan.

502
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,380
That way, both of us can compete fairly.

503
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:14,990
Ren Anle,

504
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,100
why are you helping the Crown Prince?

505
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,140
I'm not.

506
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,470
Humans are selfish, after all.

507
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,990
Think about it, Your Majesty.

508
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,780
I want to become the Crown Princess.

509
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,380
So, I need to make the first move.

510
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,470
But His Highness doesn't want to marry me

511
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,300
and all he wants is Di Ziyuan.

512
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,780
There's indeed no solution.

513
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,230
There is.

514
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,620
The Crown Princess selection.

515
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,140
Once Di Ziyuan participates,

516
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,380
His Highness will also join the process.

517
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,670
Your Highness,

518
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,470
take this imperial decree.

519
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,380
"True to our traditions and the laws of nature,

520
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,190
the palace hereby orders the Crown Prince,

521
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,380
Han Ye, who is of eligible age for marriage,

522
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,910
to marry a consort.

523
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,670
Hence, it is announced

524
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,910
[Imperial Decree]
that any pretty eligible lady

525
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,300
and sign up and take a virginity test

526
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,380
for the Crown Princess selection."

527
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,540
I thank His Majesty,

528
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,140
but my mind is set.

529
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,820
I cannot take this decree.

530
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,820
"Miss Di Ziyuan,

531
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,910
who will be released from exile,

532
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,580
is also one of the candidates.

533
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,910
That is all."

534
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,820
Will His Majesty

535
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,540
finally release her?

536
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,140
That's right.

537
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,950
His Majesty has agreed to release Di Ziyuan.

538
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,300
You actually did it.

539
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,540
Your Highness, take this decree.

540
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,580
Yes.

541
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,820
Come on.

542
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,540
I followed you all the way

543
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,140
from Jingnan to the capital,

544
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,140
and I'm offering my 30,000 navy forces as dowry

545
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,910
just to be the Crown Princess.

546
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,860
But look at you.

547
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,540
You only care

548
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,140
about Di Ziyuan on Dai Mountain.

549
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,380
Whatever you want,

550
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,910
I'll get it for you.

551
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,060
You were worried about Dongqian Pirates,

552
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,910
so I went and eradicated them.

553
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,910
You were stressed out over the cheating case,

554
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,910
so I solved it on behalf of Pei Zhan.

555
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,380
You insist on marrying Di Ziyuan,

556
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,990
so I pleaded with His Majesty

557
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,990
to release Di Ziyuan from exile.

558
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,670
Still, Your Highness,

559
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,910
can you take your eyes

560
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,340
off Di Ziyuan for a while

561
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,540
and look at this girl beside you?

562
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:11,440
♪The fireworks light up the night sky♪

563
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,710
♪My hair has turned as white as snow,
still waiting for you to look at me♪

564
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:26,430
♪If I don't survive this life,
I hope fate smiles upon you♪

565
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,470
♪No matter how long this life lasts,
my yearning for you lasts longer♪

566
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,230
Han Zhongyuan has finally agreed

567
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,580
to let Di Ziyuan leave the mountain.

568
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,580
How's our doppelganger doing up there?

569
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,670
She's been acting normally
over the past ten years.

570
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,190
It's just that

571
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,300
sometimes, she longs to see the world outside.

572
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,230
If she's an obedient pawn...

573
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,430
We'll set her free.

574
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,140
Official Luo.

575
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,140
There's something else

576
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,710
that seems weird.

577
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,430
Speak.

578
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,430
Princess Anning, who grew up with Di Ziyuan,

579
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,540
has placed a heavy bet on Ren Anle.

580
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,860
Princess Anning studied with Di Ziyuan,

581
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
and they were close friends.

582
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,670
But she fell sick days after the Di massacre,

583
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,140
and her servants died suddenly.

584
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,580
Then, she left for the Northwest,

585
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,580
and had never returned since then.

586
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,620
Then, we should find an opportunity

587
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,820
to test her.

588
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,500
[Residence of Marquis Jing'an,
the former Di Residence]

589
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,430
(Ziyuan,)

590
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,380
(His Majesty allowed you to leave the mountain.)

591
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,620
(I'm feeling)

592
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,270
(excited and scared at the same time.)

593
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,470
Ziyuan, wait for me!

594
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,620
(Anning, hurry up.)

595
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,910
(Let's play behind the rockery.)

596
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,270
(Sure.)

597
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,950
Ziyuan used to be your close friend, General.

598
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,380
Now that she's returning to the capital,

599
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,910
you should be happy.

600
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,230
I am happy.

601
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,670
It's just that I often
lost to her when we sparred,

602
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,300
and I don't want to be disgraced again.

603
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,380
It's been ten years.

604
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,380
This residence

605
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,430
will finally have its mistress back.

606
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,430
Still, I wonder if her return

607
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,140
would a blessing

608
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,820
or misfortune for her.

609
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,430
You've also been away for years,

610
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,540
being stationed in the Northwest.

611
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,580
Why is that so?

612
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,910
I love the Northwest.

613
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,820
That's a very free region,

614
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,430
where I can ride my horse and do archery.

615
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,910
Unlike this boring palace.

616
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,380
Indeed.

617
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,620
Only the palace would produce such a boring man.

618
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,580
But as far as I know,

619
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,430
you used to be a genteel girl.

620
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
Why would you want to stay in that savage land?

621
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,380
It was Ziyuan who showed the timid me

622
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,060
grandeur mountains

623
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,910
and vast skies.

624
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,140
Greetings, Princess Anning.

625
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,540
To commemorate our meeting,

626
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,780
I've prepared a gift for you.

627
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,060
What is this?

628
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,810
It's so pretty.

629
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,990
How beautiful!

630
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,430
You are the Eldest Princess of Jing.

631
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,140
One day, you shall travel across the nation

632
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,140
to look at the boundless mountains and rivers.

633
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,430
(I knew something happened between them.)

634
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,060
With 30,000 navy forces under her command,

635
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,670
Ren Anle is the talk of the capital,

636
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,710
and solving the cheating case gave her prestige,

637
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,230
winning the support of the people.

638
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,990
Ren Anle has all the conditions to her advantage,

639
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,780
the position of the Crown Princess

640
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,820
would naturally...

641
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,950
Would naturally be a piece of cake.

642
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,910
However, as Ren Anle, everything I said

643
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,230
and every pledge I swore...

644
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,380
None of them counts.

645
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,710
Then,

646
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,340
do you know

647
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,990
why you've become a popular candidate again?

648
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,860
Anning placed a huge bet on you.

649
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,620
Perhaps,

650
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,780
you can invite her here to enjoy some music

651
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,820
and have a heart-to-heart conversation.

652
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,060
Wine makes people talk.

653
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,400
[Residence of the Princess]

654
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:31,910
Anning.

655
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,270
Anle.

656
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,140
What brings you here?

657
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,910
It's a lovely night. We can't let it go to waste.

658
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,950
With you around,

659
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,540
I guess I can still call this night lovely.

660
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,990
Are you unhappy?

661
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,990
No.

662
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,100
Tell me if you're feeling upset.

663
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,670
I will only listen, and won't offer advice.

664
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,140
If you don't offer advice,

665
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,910
why would I tell you?

666
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,990
When someone's depressed,

667
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,870
she needs a quiet listener.

668
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,390
Ten years ago,

669
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,390
I had a very close friend.

670
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,220
Due to certain reasons,

671
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,990
His Majesty ordered

672
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,870
her whole family should be massacred.

673
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,100
Although my friend survived,

674
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,140
she was thousands of miles apart
and we couldn't meet.

675
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,910
Since then, I've always felt guilty.

676
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,950
I joined the military because of her,

677
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,700
but it was only my wishful thinking.

678
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,870
I know what I owe her

679
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,910
and I can never repay her this life.

680
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,580
I didn't want her to get in trouble

681
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,910
but I was too weak to stop it.

682
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,430
Anning,

683
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,700
I'm sure she can feel

684
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,510
what you said just now.

685
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,910
Don't be upset.

686
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,620
Go, let's have fun at Lingxiang Pleasure House.

687
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,310
Bet on Ren Anle! Do it.

688
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,980
I heard that you placed a huge bet on me.

689
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,140
To express my gratitude,

690
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,460
I'll get you the prettiest courtesan

691
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,620
at this Pleasure House.

692
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,740
She'll keep us company.

693
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,430
What do you think?

694
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,740
The prettiest?

695
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,180
Ren Anle, you're truly a genius.

696
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,140
Of course.

697
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,660
You've seen a bunch of rugged soldiers.

698
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,910
So it's time to see the prettiest girls

699
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,830
and try something new.

700
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,060
Sure.

701
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,950
Let me see how pretty she is.

702
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,390
If she does look good,

703
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,830
we'll have her to ourselves tonight.

704
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,740
Let's go.

705
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,240
[Crown Prince's Residence]

706
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,470
Your Highness.

707
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,470
Your Highness.

708
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,910
What?

709
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,910
You're out of breath.

710
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,430
Princess Anning and Official Ren

711
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,950
are at Xiangling Pleasure House again.

712
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,060
I thought something horrible happened.

713
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,580
They became sworn sisters there.

714
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,100
So, they went back there

715
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,580
to enjoy a drink. That's normal.

716
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,390
But Princess Anning said

717
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,030
she would have the courtesan the whole night.

718
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,390
That's absurd.

719
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,470
One, one, one!

720
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,100
Six!

721
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,950
I don't think you can beat me.

722
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,430
Come on.

723
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,220
Look closely.

724
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,700
Is that your lucky puff?

725
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,300
Roll it!

726
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,220
Drink.

727
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,830
-Drink.
-I'll drink up.

728
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,830
I...

729
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,870
Where's the courtesan?

730
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,950
Relax, ladies.

731
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,430
Miss Linlang is preparing.

732
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:50,990
Take her time.

733
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,780
The night is long.

734
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,780

735
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,030

738
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,100
How dare you barge in here?

739
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Barge?

740
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,350
I thought he was your man.

741
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,300
Yes.

742
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,220
I am not her man.

743
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,830
What's going on here?

744
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,700
So, are you or are you not her man?

745
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:18,990
What do you mean?

746
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,740
You're quitting?

747
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,430
I am your bodyguard, General.

748
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,140
I misunderstood Official Ren.

749
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,780
Well, it's my fault.

750
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,950
Don't quarrel.

751
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,510
Next time, I'll just ask

752
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,300
if he's your personal bodyguard.

753
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,830
Ren Anle.

754
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,550
Ren Anle.

755
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,220
Go away.

756
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,220
Come on, Ren Anle.

757
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,580
How dare you tease me?

758
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,700
He's looking at us.

759
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,700
But you know what?

760
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,140
I'm feeling on a roll.

761
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,260
Ren Anle.

762
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,950
We'll get wasted tonight.

763
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,870
Of course.

764
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,700
Official Luo.

765
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,550
I'm going to meet the two ladies.

766
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,870
Anning does not like extravagance.

767
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,780
Simple and plain will do.

768
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:58,780
Linlang,

769
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,070
you need to make sure

770
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,830
everyone loves you.

771
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,510
You seem to be reluctant

772
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,550
to let Official Ren be the Crown Princess.

773
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,700
Ren Anle's goal

774
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,070
is never about being the Crown Princess.

775
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,430
How are your preparations?

776
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,140
I've prepared three to five songs I'm good at

777
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,070
for the ladies to choose from.

778
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,510
You don't need that many.

779
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,510
One song is enough.

780
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,140
It's always this hard to get that lady.

781
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,780
If she still doesn't come,

782
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,350
we'll be out of booze.

783
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,870
Let me go take a look.

784
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,700
Oh, my.

785
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,220
I saw what you did.

786
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,700
Isn't that personal enough?

787
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,030
He literally

788
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,510
held you in his arms.

789
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,830
Your eyes were fooling you.

790
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,260
Impossible.

791
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,830
You must be drunk.

792
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,740
Ladies, Miss Linlang is here.

793
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,660
My name is Linlang.

794
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Greetings, General,

795
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,430
and Official Ren.

796
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,430
Requiem?

797
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,390
When we were young,

798
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,960
Ziyuan played this song too.

799
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,430
