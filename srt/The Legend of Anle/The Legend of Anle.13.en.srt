00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,340
the only person who has visited her

186
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,900
is her former bodyguard, Luo Mingxi.

187
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,340
Humiliated, she had to change her name
before she could return,

188
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,740
and now she's all alone

189
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,740
in the capital.

190
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Then, why haven't you

191
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,220
visited her yet?

192
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,500
The gap between us has grown too wide.

193
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,660
If you want your family to reconcile with hers,

194
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,860
then it's best if you marry the girl

195
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,540
from Dai Mountain.

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,380
That's why the Crown Princess

197
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,500
can only be Di Ziyuan.

198
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,600
[Yuanshui Pavilion]

199
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,620
Has the Empress Dowager

200
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,740
called me into the palace?

201
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,260
No matter how many Buddhist sutras you copy,

202
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,780
you will not gain the Empress Dowager's favor.

203
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,420
I am neither the daughter
of the powerful Marquis Zhongyi

204
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,860
nor the noble Princess of Northern Qin.

205
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,220
As the daughter of a sinner,

206
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
other than presenting

207
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,500
some handwritten Buddhist sutras,

208
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,900
what else could I do?

209
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,980
Have you revised

210
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,900
Di Ziyuan's past today?

211
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,260
I've been memorizing it for ten years.

212
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,620
Everything's imprinted on my mind.

213
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,620
Even Luo Mingxi, her closest friend,

214
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,780
didn't suspect me, did he?

215
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,220
The people in the palace are unfathomable.

216
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,300
Do not let your guard down.

217
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,500
Mu Qing.

218
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,460
I know you want the best for me.

219
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,420
I'll revise her life story
after I finish copying this.

220
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,380
Now, the Crown Prince
insists on marrying no one else but me.

221
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,860
His confidante, Luo Mingxi,

222
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,380
is also showering me with affection.

223
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,660
As long as I win the Emperor
and the Empress Dowager's favor,

224
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,540
the position of Crown Princess

225
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,340
will be mine.

226
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,220
Stop coveting things that do not belong to you.

227
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,260
What about my decade-long imprisonment
in Dai Mountain

228
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,420
and the humiliation I'm facing now?

229
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,500
Do they belong to me?

230
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,140
Miss Di.

231
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,740
The Empress Dowager has sent someone here.

232
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,980
You managed to execute

233
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,340
a cunning strategy this round.

234
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,780
Well played.

235
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,100
Still, my skills are not enough

236
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,620
to defeat you, Official Luo.

237
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,980
This is why I have lost.

238
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,340
If only Di Cheng'en

239
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,780
had half of your talents,

240
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,380
I wouldn't be so worried now.

241
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,260
Perhaps her inadequate skill in weiqi

242
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,260
is not due to her lack of talent.

243
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,500
I heard from Qianyue Pavilion

244
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,860
that she has been sending
her handwritten Buddhist sutras

245
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,340
to the Empress Dowager.

246
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,860
It looks like

247
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,740
she's desiring more than freedom.

248
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,260
Mu Qing.

249
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,780
The Empress Dowager sent someone to inform me

250
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,900
that the Empress Dowager
praised my calligraphy,

251
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,340
and she wants me to write the plaque
for the newly built prison.

252
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,340
She has finally acknowledged me.

253
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,220
Do you know that the prison

254
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,980
was rebuilt from the Residence of Marquis Jing'an?

255
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,820
The Residence of Marquis Jing'an
had been abandoned for years,

256
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,620
so they're making good use of it, aren't they?

257
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,500
You are now Di Ziyuan.

258
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,740
The Residence of Marquis Jing'an
is your former residence.

259
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,980
When I want to be the Crown Princess,

260
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,740
I'm not Di Ziyuan.

261
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,420
When they want someone to write the plaque,

262
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,620
I'm her.

263
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,420
Mu Qing.

264
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,380
The Crown Prince has not visited me,

265
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,100
and the Empress Dowager is making
my life miserable because of my identity.

266
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,900
If I offend both of them in this dispute,

267
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,620
I would be sent back to Dai Mountain,

268
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,220
and then

269
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,020
I'd never get to leave there anymore.

270
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,100
Excuse me.

271
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,900
Make way.

272
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,500

273
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,580
What is it?

274
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,180
People from the Northern Qin are here.

275
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,940
The Princess of Northern Qin
is joining the Crown Princess selection.

276
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,140
They've probably sent some emissaries
in advance.

277
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,260
The Jing State and the Northern Qin
may have called a truce,

278
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,340
but our relations are far from cordial,
and they're joining the selection?

279
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,300
News of the Northern Qin
seems to reach your ears quickly.

280
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,180
I was stationed at the borders with you,

281
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,700
and under your influence,

282
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,940
I have developed an interest in their affairs.

283
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,020
Is that so?

284
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,180
That's right.

285
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,660
You're over-exaggerating.

286
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,060
The people from Northern Qin are cunning.

287
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,540
Keep your guard up.

[Ministry of Justice]

289
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,300
I heard she's ill,

290
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
and you still refuse

291
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,940
to visit her.

292
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
You do have a heart of stone.

293
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,620
Do you think she's really ill?

294
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,020
They built a prison right on her former residence,
and they want her to write the prison's plaque.

295
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,900
This is utter humiliation.

296
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
It's worse

297
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,140
than telling her to change her name.

298
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,140
That's why the ministers
have petitioned to object,

299
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,460
and they've dropped the matter for now.

300
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,420
But if Ziyuan didn't insist

301
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,260
on sending her handwritten sutras
to the Empress Dowager,

302
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,580
she wouldn't have attracted such trouble.

303
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,820
Still, I am not qualified to comment on this.

304
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,660
Back then,

305
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,020
had I not presented the sword
of the Di family to His Majesty,

306
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,660
I wouldn't be here,

307
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,020
sitting and chatting with you,

308
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,380
right?

309
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,940
This incident has reaffirmed my belief

310
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,940
that her will has remained the same
despite her decade-long suffering.

311
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,460
She changed her name just to avoid trouble.

312
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,540
She would never forget
what happened to her family.

313
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,900
I seem to detect several connotations
in your statement.

314
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,580
Do you also think

315
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,180
that my family sided with yours
just to avoid trouble,

316
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,900
and not because we were truly loyal

317
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,220
to the current emperor?

318
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,780
Both of us are outsiders.

319
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,060
We cannot hold a candle

320
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
to what she has experienced.

321
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,060
I guess that's why you're scared of meeting her.

322
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,940
Actually, the royal family
showed her enough mercy

323
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,060
when you asked her life to be spared.

324
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,140
So, there's no need for you

325
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,660
to honor that promise

326
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,940
of making her Crown Princess.

327
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,940
Luo Mingxi.

328
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,580
Are you instigating me?

329
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,580
I have always stayed loyal to Ziyuan.

330
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,260
However, now that she's returned to the capital,

331
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,380
I need to be prudent

332
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,940
so that she becomes the Crown Princess.

333
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,780
How will you do so?

334
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,540
The palace will hold a banquet
for the Crown Princess selection.

335
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,940
Before that, if she can keep a low profile,

336
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,180
everything will proceed smoothly.

337
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,700
How will you ensure that?

338
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,380
Yes.

339
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,700
She has suffered for so long.

340
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,260
But if I act on impulse,

341
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,820
everyone would target her.

342
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,820
Even the hidden guards you sent

343
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,020
couldn't stop the Empress Dowager's people.

344
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,380
I guess my hidden guards

345
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,660
have always been underwhelming.

346
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,100
You mean Ren Anle?

347
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,420
How do you know?

348
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
How do I know?

349
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,140
The Northern Qin is joining the selection,
but you seem uninterested,

350
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,740
and you refuse to meet Ziyuan.

351
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,380
What you care about,

352
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,860
and what tugs at your heartstrings,

353
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,180
is her, isn't it?

354
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
Oh, Luo Mingxi.

355
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,180
Worldly relationships

356
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,420
matter the least
when selecting a Crown Princess.

357
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,780
I'm not saying I'm in love with her.

358
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,940
You don't have to explain to me.

359
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
I just need to remind you

360
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,660
that the Crown Princess selection

361
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,420
will impact the nation's future.

362
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,180
Everyone wants to join this game,

363
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,580
each with their own motives.

364
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,500
Think about it.

stop you from visiting her,

367
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,860
she wouldn't be at risk,

368
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,940
or it's possible

369
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,900
that someone would drown her quietly.

370
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,180
The human mind is the most unpredictable.

371
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,100
Give it more thought.

375
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,460
You don't have to show me to the door.

It's Official Luo.

377
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,740
Still, Your Highness,

378

you are as attentive as ever.

379
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,940
The capital is in its hottest season
at this time of the year,

380
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,020
and looks like we have another dry year

381
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,220
coming ahead.

382
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,820
But in Jingnan,

383
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,860
this is also when the Flowers of Longing
are in full bloom.

384
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,180
Jingnan has never had heavy snow,

385
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,820
unlike the capital.

386
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,140
Still, after staying here for so many years,

387
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,860
you and I should have gotten used to it.

388
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,380
Dress warmly.

389
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Thank you for your concern.

390
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,180
What are you doing?

391

A wind is blowing.

392
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Looks like the whirlwind in the capital

393
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,740
is coming sooner than I thought.

394
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Your Highness, you should go back soon.

Remember to return it.

399

Your Highness.

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,380
I think it's raining soon. Let me hitch a ride.

401
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,500
Your Highness, Miss Di has finally arrived

402
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,340
and so has

403
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,060
the Princess of Northern Qin.

404
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,580
What a happy occasion.

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,460
Stop talking nonsense.

I have not met Ziyuan yet.

408
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,940
Are you trying to prove

409
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,340
your innocence and determination to me?

410
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,860
I shall take note of it.

411

412
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,620
The Princess of Northern Qin
is joining the selection too.

413
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,660
I know that the marriage of the Crown Prince

414
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,820
is a national affair as much as it is personal,

415
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,380
but I feel so perplexed now.

416
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,060
It's pouring.

417
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,780
You claimed to be perplexed,

418
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,140
but you still leaned towards me
without hesitation.

419
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,660
Wipe yourself dry.

420
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,220
I just don't want you to catch a cold,

421
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,500
or else no one would be working
at the Court of Judicial Review.

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,180
I chose to work there

423
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,260
to relieve you, Your Highness.

424
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,620
Since you're perplexed,

425
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,060
allow me, your problem solver, to help you.

426
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,060
How about this?

427
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,940
I heard that
when the Princess of Northern Qin arrives,

428
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,180
His Majesty will hold a grand feast

429
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,820
to start the Crown Princess selection.

at Lingxiang Pleasure House tomorrow.

What do you think?

433
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,380
Ridiculous.

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,180
After all, during the banquet,

435
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,380

If not for this portrait,

I'd have almost forgotten your visage.

440

When you left 13 years ago,

441
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,180
the weather was as horrible as it is now.

442
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,980
At that time, I waited miserably here,

443
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,700
only to hear the announcement of your death.

444
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,140
Now,

445
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,060
even the surviving daughter
of the Di family has returned.

446
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,660
Do you expect me to treat her with kindness?

447
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,700
For that Di woman,

448
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,220
you've always been partial to them,

449
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,500
yet you've never spared a thought for me.

out of the ordinary?

She may have gotten away from writing the plaque,

454
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,340
but she seems to be sending

455
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,380
her handwritten sutras more often.

without my permission?

You could have stayed hidden
and feigned illness until I return

Despite having 80,000 soldiers,

547
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,380
the Di family couldn't escape
from the Emperor's wrath.

00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,340
I'm getting a little tired.

733
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,740
We'll drink

734
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,380
next time.

735
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,180
Sure.

736
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,620
[Crown Prince's Residence]

737
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,340
Your Highness.

738
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,740
Was the lady we saw

739
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,940
really Di Ziyuan, whom you often mention?

740
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,540
Why do I think that she's not as you described?

741
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,820
Her eyes

742
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,020
do look like the Ziyuan I remember.

743
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,540
Still, her personality

744
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,220
feels like a stranger to me.

745
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,020
Compared to Anle,

746
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,980
you could say she's not

747
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,180
to your liking, right?

748
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,940
Ridiculous.

749
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,140
Wen Shuo.

750
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,900
Do you remember anything
from when you were young?

751
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,980
When I was young?

752
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,500
I caught a bad cold when I was little

753
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
and almost died.

754
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,340
After that,

755
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,540
I can't really remember my life
before five years old.

756
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,580
I only remembered that I met you...

757
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,580
It's fine if you don't remember.

758
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,500
The past is not important.

759
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,780
If the past is not important,

760
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,500
why can't you let go of Miss Di and move on?
