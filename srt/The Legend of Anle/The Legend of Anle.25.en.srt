[Episode 25]

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,660
I, Gu Yunnian, the convict,

26
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,060
am here, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:49,460
Long live Your Majesty.

28
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,980
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

29
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,460
I wish you longevity.

30
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Gu Yunnian,

31
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,060
Zhang Jian testified against you
and said that you received a secret order

32
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,060
to eradicate the Di Troops.

33
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,260
Did you know that?

34
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,060
(Don't worry.)

35
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,060
(I will save you.)

36
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,700
(I remember what you did for me)

37
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,180
(back then.)

38
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,740
Out with the truth.

39
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,060
I trusted you before.

40
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,020
How could you

41
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,780
attempt such a rebellious act?

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,020
Yes.

43
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,740
I did receive a letter

44
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,860
to kill the Di Troops.

45
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,740
But even now,

46
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,780
I had no idea who wrote the letter.

47
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,380
And I burned it

48
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,620
as instructed in the letter.

49
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,020
You didn't know who wrote it?

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,620
You followed the order

51
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,300
even when you didn't know who wrote the letter?

52
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,060
Gu Yunnian,

53
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,780
back then, you were already
an esteemed commander.

54
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,300
How could you commit such a mistake?

55
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,980
Ren Anle,

56
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,180
when I say I don't know, that means I don't know.

57
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,620
I was responsible for everything.

58
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,740
On the surface, you were trying
to ambush Northern Qin.

59
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,380
But in reality, you were massacring the Di Troops.

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,100
You committed such a heinous deed

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,500
without knowing

62
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,660
who ordered you to do so?

63
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,300
And you even burned the evidence.

64
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,620
I assume you never thought

65
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,620
that people would try to redress the case
after so many years, huh?

66
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,580
Enough!

67
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,620
His Majesty and the Crown Prince
didn't even utter a single word.

68
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,460
Who do you think you are,
interrogating him yourself?

69
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,780
I am

70
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,580
sharing their burden right now.

71
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,180
Your Majesty,

72
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,580
Official Ren has a point.

73
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,780
Gu Yunnian, you've committed such a heinous crime.

74
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,620
Don't think that you can get away with this

75
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,740
just by saying that you have no idea.

76
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,740
That's right.

77
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Back then, there were only a few people
who could order him to do so

78
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,060
since he was already a high-ranking official.

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,180
Don't think of leaving this hall

80
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,060
until you've explained everything.

81
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,140
Your Majesty,

82
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,380
the letter is long gone.

83
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,340
Just treat this as my fault.

84
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,460
However, Your Majesty,

85
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,260
I've never let you down.

86
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,020
You never let His Majesty down, huh?

87
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
The cheating case during the examination,

88
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,060
the flood in Jiangnan,

89
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,340
the annihilation of the Zhong family,
and the assassination in the palace,

90
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,820
how could you say
that you didn't let His Majesty down

91
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,700
after committing all these atrocious deeds?

92
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,380
Your Majesty,

93
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm not a cultured individual.

94
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,020
However, I have no idea

95
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,540
why you think this person is a patriot.

96
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,940
I was just trying to protect my son.

97
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,620
That's why I concealed his mistakes
by doing the wrong things.

98
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,020
Although I've committed slight blunders,

99
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,220
I've never committed major crimes.

100
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,220
Gu Yunnian, you massacred
the Di Troops by mistake.

101
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,620
And now, you still try to sound
grand and imposing?

102
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,260
Don't tell me you want to put the blame
on His Majesty.

103
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,500
Ren Anle,

104
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
stop your nonsense!

105
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,260
Gu Yunnian,

106
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,500
since it has come to this,

107
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,180
the crimes you've committed until now

108
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,580
were enough for you to be sentenced to death.

109
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,140
You better tell us the truth!

110
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,180
Do you want your family and clan
to be executed as well?

111
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,180
Out with the truth!

112
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,940
Your Majesty,

113
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
it was an old case from ten years ago.

114
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,940
I cannot remember now.

115
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,000
Since Zhang Jian said there was a letter,

116
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,620
that means the letter did exist.

117
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,420
If Empress Dowager said there was no letter,
that means the letter didn't exist.

118
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Your Majesty, I've served you all my life.

119
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm sure you know my personality well.

120
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
I admit that I'm prideful
due to my achievements.

121
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,620
That's why I was arrogant enough
to ignore the law.

122
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,380
However, I wasn't the one

123
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,140
who arranged for the assassination.

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,120
However, Your Majesty,
since you're already doubting me,

125
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,180
no matter what I say, it's useless.

126
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,700
Now,

127
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,260
no one will believe in my words.

128
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
The Marquis Zhongyi today

129
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
is just like the Marquis Jing'an back then!

130
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,140
This must be karma.

131
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,340
That's fine.

132
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,780
Nurture the wicked to control the virtuous.

133
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,980
Kill the wicked to establish authority.

134
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,460
Since I'm a wicked official,

135
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,900
Your Majesty, I'll serve you one last time.

136
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,940
I shall

137
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,140
make my exit.

138
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,620
Gu Yunnian!

139
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,180
Your Majesty,

140
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,060
Empress Dowager,

141
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,380
Gu Yunnian is dead.

142
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,340
Gu Yunnian is dead.

143
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,020
Now, we have no way to verify
the secret letter's existence.

144
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,540
The old case of the Di family

145
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,260
has now turned into an unsolvable case.

146
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,020
Since that's the case,

147
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,180
I shall leave this case
to the Three Monitoring Offices.

148
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,340
Someone,

149
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,900
take them away.

150
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,860
Today's my birthday banquet.

151
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,660
It's also the Crown Princess's
conferring ceremony.

152
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,140
Everyone,

153
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,620
I hope you guys are not affected
by that incident just now.

154
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Di Cheng'en,

155
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,860
come here.

156
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,860
Your Majesty,

157
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,500
Empress Dowager,

158
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,020
I don't know who Zhong Hai is

159
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,500
and what he was talking about.

160
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,900
I only know

161
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,020
that the Di family has let Jing State down.

162
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,580
And, Empress Dowager, your birthday banquet

163
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,740
was affected by the crimes of the Di family again.

164
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,460
Please pardon me.

165
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,380
Di Cheng'en of the Di family
is filial and loyal to her ruler.

166
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,140
Her actions are to be commended.

167
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,700
I understand your feelings.

168
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,900
From now on,

169
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,620
Di Cheng'en is no longer the daughter of a rebel.

170
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,500
She's the Crown Princess of Jing.

171
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

172
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,140
Wait.

173
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,540
Di Cheng'en has no right to acknowledge
the Di family's crime on their behalf.

174
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,700
I don't think Di Cheng'en

175
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,260
is suitable as the Crown Princess.

176
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,020
Your Majesty, please rescind your edict.

177
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,900
Ren Anle,

178
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,620
what are you saying?

179
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,380
I'm the orphaned daughter of the Di family.

180
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,860
Why would I have no right to acknowledge
the Di family's crimes on their behalf?

181
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,500
Your Majesty,

182
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,740
Empress Dowager,

183
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,620
I've already acknowledged their crimes.

184
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
The Di family will not deny

185
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,100
the heinous crimes they'd committed.

186
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,660
The Di family is innocent.

187
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,900
I've already confessed to it.

188
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,980
What nonsense are you saying?

189
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
The Di family is innocent.

190
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,020
Ren Anle,

191
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,900
what are you doing?

192
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,980
Do you know what you're saying?

193
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,340
I said,

194
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,620
Di Cheng'en has no right to acknowledge
the Di family's crimes on their behalf.

195
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,860
The only person who can speak
on the Di family's behalf

196
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,900
is me, Di Ziyuan.

197
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,780
You...

198
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,820
Di Ziyuan?

199
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,060
Did you say you were Di Ziyuan?

200
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,740
Ren Anle, are you out of your mind?

201
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,020
I'm the true Di Ziyuan!

202
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,380
You're just a female pirate from Jingnan.

203
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,460
What are you up to?

204
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,580
You said you're Di Ziyuan.

205
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,660
What evidence do you have?

206
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,620
I think

207
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,300
you're still bent on being the Crown Princess.

208
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,620
That's why you intend to stir up trouble here.

209
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,020
Fine.

210
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,020
You said you were Di Ziyuan, right?

211
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,260
Di Ziyuan received a scar on her left shoulder

212
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,140
when she was playing in the palace at a young age.

213
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,420
Since you said you were Di Ziyuan,

214
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,780
do you dare to show us the scar?

215
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Why not?

216
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,020
Sun Momo.

217
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,180
Anning.

218
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
Check her shoulder.

219
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,260
Check it thoroughly.

220
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,780
Yes.

221
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,900
Ziyuan.

222
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,020
Just tell them what you see.

223
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,740
I trust you.

224
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,740
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager,

225
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,500
there's a scar on Official Ren's left shoulder.

226
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,620
Ridiculous.

227
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,260
Do you think you can prove that you're Di Ziyuan

228
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,260
with that scar alone?

229
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,740
I have a witness too.

230
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,140
Who is your witness?

231
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
His Highness,

232
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,500
do you think I'm Di Ziyuan?

233
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,100
(If no one believed that you were Di Ziyuan,)

234
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,180
you would have no way to redress the case.

235
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
I have a witness.

236
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,780
I'm afraid

237
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,620
that he might not do what you wish for.

238
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,540
I just need to let him know

239
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,700
that my family was framed back then.

240
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,060
Han Ye will definitely side with me.

241
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,140
Between justice and world peace,

242
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,060
which do you think is more important to Han Ye?

243
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,700
Why do you trust Han Ye so much?

244
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,140
If achieving world peace is his dream,

245
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,980
justice should be what he preaches.

246
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,900
If world peace is established

247
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,700
upon the foundation of injustice,

248
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,740
Han Ye

249
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,620
will never agree to it.

250
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,980
Your Highness,

251
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,260
injustice fills the streets.

252
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,260
How could I remain peaceful and happy?

253
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,460
Your Majesty,

254
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,140
Ren Anle is Di Ziyuan indeed.

255
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,740
I believe in the Crown Prince.

256
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,780
I will take you as Di Ziyuan for now.

257
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,740
Your Majesty!

258
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,260
However,

259
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,620
if you're Di Ziyuan,

260
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,140
who is she?

261
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,860
Your Majesty, you issued an edict and sent me

262
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,660
to Yongning Temple ten years ago.

263
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,620
I swapped my identity with hers.

264
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,980
She went to Dai Mountain on my behalf.

265
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,260
After that,

266
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,780
I became an outlaw.

267
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,300
I became Ren Anle, the pirate
of Anle Abode in Jingnan.

268
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,300
So, you didn't mean it
when you proposed to the Crown Prince

269
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,660
with 30,000 navy forces as your dowry.

270
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,980
It was

271
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,700
a meticulous plot
devised by you from the start.

272
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,620
Ren Anle, the pirate of Jingnan,

273
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,820
did come here to propose to His Highness.

274
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,540
However, I'm standing here as Di Ziyuan.

275
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,020
I'm here to redress the Di family's grievances.

276
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,900
Ren Anle!

277
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,980
Your identity as Di Ziyuan

278
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,900
doesn't make your words more convincing.

279
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,540
Empress Dowager, please show everyone

280
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,260
the birthday gift I gave you.

281
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,860
Zhao Fu.

282
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,340
Your Highness, please open the scroll.

283
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,820
Vanguard of Di Troops Tiger Battalion,

284
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,220
Zhang Shaocheng.

285
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,300
Died on Qingnan Mountain

286
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,340
at the age of 28.

287
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,660
Tribune of Di Troops Tiger Battalion,

288
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,220
Zhao Honghai.

289
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,620
Died on Qingnan Mountain

290
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,540
at the age of 32.

291
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,380
Centurion of Di Troops Tiger Battalion,

292
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,300
Sun Zhaofang.

293
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,820
Died on Qingnan Mountain

294
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,700
at the age of 35.

295
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,100
Soldier of Di Troops Tiger Battalion,

296
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,380
Wang Hongyu.

297
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,100
Died on Qingnan Mountain

298
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,060
at the age of 25.

299
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,100
Soldier of Di Troops Tiger Battalion,

300
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,540
Liu Yufang.

301
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,100
Died on Qingnan Mountain

302
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,020
(at the age of 27.)

303
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,540
(Soldier of Di Troops Tiger Battalion,)

304
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,740
(Sun Yucheng.)

305
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,540
(Died on Qingnan Mountain)

306
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,140
(at the age of 23.)

307
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,060
Ziyuan,

308
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm afraid the few of us

309
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,380
cannot shake up the case of the Di family.

310
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,700
It's not just us.

311
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,620
There are another 80,000 of us.

312
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,140
They are always

313
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,220
by our side.

314
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,700
Your Majesty,

315
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,380
loyal officials had been framed,

316
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,140
and the soldiers were angry about their deaths.

317
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,060
Your Majesty, please clear the Di family's name

318
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,700
and uphold justice for the people!

319
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,820
Gu Yunnian is already dead.

320
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,020
No matter if he massacred the Di Troops

321
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,540
on purpose or not,

322
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,540
there's no way for us to verify it now.

323
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,700
However,

324
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,540
one thing was clear.

325
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,580
The Di Troops acted without an order.

326
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,900
There was ironclad evidence of their crime.

327
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,220
Even if you're Di Ziyuan,

328
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,540
you can't just redress grievances
without any evidence.

329
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,300
Gu Yunnian is dead indeed.

330
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,540
And there's no way to tell
if he killed my people on purpose

331
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
or if he received a secret letter.

332
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,540
However, Your Majesty

333
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,140
did send a letter to my father back then.

334
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,500
I never wrote

335
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,660
to Di Yongning

336
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,820
that year.

337
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,300
This concerns my father's innocence.

338
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,900
I will not lie.

339
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,820
Back then, Your Majesty,
you sent a letter to Jingnan.

340
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,340
You ordered my father
to deploy his troops to the Northwest.

341
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,780
Gu Yunnian confiscated
all of the commanders' tallies

342
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,300
when he executed my clan.

343
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,540
However, he didn't find the secret letter.

344
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,540
It's because my father handed the letter

345
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,580
to me.

346
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Now, the secret letter

347
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,660
is in this very hall.

348
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,580
Where is it?

349
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Your Highness,

350
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,700
please hand your fan to me.

351
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,540
Why did you give the fan to me?

352
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,620
It's because you're my safest bet, Your Highness.

353
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,300
The hardest object to forge in the entire world

354
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,340
is your imperial edict, Your Majesty.

355
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,380
I did not write that letter.

356
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,220
Grand Chancellor of the Right,

357
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,300
you're the elder of two dynasties.

358
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,820
You were the Imperial Tutor too.

359
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm sure you know
His Majesty's handwriting the best.

360
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,860
Of course I can recognize
His Majesty's handwriting.

361
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,740
If so, please see
if this is His Majesty's handwriting.

362
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,220
This concerns the lives
of 80,000 innocent people.

363
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,740
Grand Chancellor of the Right,

364
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,060
please tell us the truth.

365
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,220
Speak.

366
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,540
Your Majesty,

367
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,660
according to the secret letter,
you ordered the 80,000 Di Troops from Jingnan

368
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,300
to deploy their troops to the Northwest

369
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,900
on the day they received the letter.

370
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,060
And your imperial seal is on the letter.

371
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,380
As for the handwriting,

372
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,100
Your Majesty, it is your handwriting.

373
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,820
I did not write this letter!

374
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,540
But the Grand Chancellor of the Right
has already proven

375
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,060
that the handwriting was yours, Your Majesty.

376
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,380
What a joke.

377
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,460
I'm the Emperor.

378
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,360
Do you expect me to prove my innocence to you?

379
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,820
Your Majesty.

380
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,620
Right Chancellor,

381
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,420
do you not trust me as well?

382
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,900
If that's the case,

383
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,180
Your Majesty, please uphold justice

384
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,380
for the people.

385
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,220
Your Majesty, please uphold justice
for the people.

386
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,020
Your Majesty, please uphold justice
for the people.

387
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,500
Your Majesty, please uphold justice
for the people.

388
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,020
Are you guys

389
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,980
trying to rebel here?

390
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,300
Your Majesty, please clear the Di family's name

391
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,900
and uphold justice for the people.

392
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,660
Are you guys trying to rebel here?

393
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,860
Your Majesty, please give us an explanation.

394
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,060
Crown Prince,

395
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,460
do you not trust me as well?

396
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,060
Your Majesty, I only believe in evidence.

397
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,340
His Majesty didn't write the letter.

398
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,220
(But I'm worried)

399
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,700
that we lack the most important witness.

400
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,060
We still have no way to testify
against the mastermind.

401
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Han Zhongyuan represents
the entire imperial family.

402
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,140
As long as I can influence the crowd
and make him bow,

403
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,460
our issue will be resolved.

404
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,140
That's the reason why I dare
confront them in the imperial court.

405
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,300
As for Anning,

406
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,540
although I don't want to drag her into this,

407
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,020
she should act out
of her sense of responsibility

408
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,260
in front of the crowd.

409
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,700
His Majesty didn't write the letter.

410
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,540
It was the Empress Dowager.

411
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,620
Anning,

412
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,580
what are you saying?

413
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,140
You're accusing your own grandmother!

414
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,220
The Empress Dowager of Jing!

415
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,100
Anning, oh, Anning.

416
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,780
I have no idea how I raised

417
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,380
an unfilial granddaughter like you.

418
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,060
How dare you accuse me and ruin my name in public!

419
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,140
Your Majesty!

420
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,620
Your Majesty,

421
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,140
since Princess Anning said

422
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,620
that this incident was related
to the Empress Dowager,

423
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,700
why don't we hear

424
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,820
what Princess Anning has to say?

425
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,540
Such nonsense!

426
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,060
Anning,

427
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,900
you must be confused.

428
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,060
Someone.

429
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,060
Princess Anning is unwell.

430
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,580
Bring her to her chamber.

431
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,700
But...

432
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,460
Shut up!

433
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,820
This is no place for you to speak.

434
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
On the night Your Majesty executed the Di family,

435
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,300
I went to Jingxin Hall.

436
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,540
That night,

437
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,140
I intended to seek Grandmother
so that she could make a plea for the Di family.

438
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,140
However,

439
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
I found out about her secret instead.

440
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,820
How's Marquis Jing'an doing?

441
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,540
He already killed himself.

442
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,900
That's good.

443
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,190
At least he won't need to know
about the fall of the Di family.

444
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,820
It'll be worse than death to him.

445
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,900
However...

446
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
What is it?

447
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,700
Although His Majesty executed
the entire Di family,

448
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,540
he spared Di Ziyuan.

449
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,460
Forget it.

450
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,140
She's just a girl.

451
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,180
He's keeping her alive

452
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,140
so that people won't spread gossip
about his cruelty.

453
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,620
Just grant her an accidental death
after two years.

454
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,900
Your Majesty, you're wise indeed.

455
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,460
If not, even if I stole
His Majesty's imperial seal

456
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,980
and sent the fake edict to Jingnan,

457
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,140
Marquis Jing'an might not believe

458
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,780
that His Majesty issued a secret edict

459
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,620
and ordered him to deploy his 80,000 troops
to the Northwest.

460
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,380
By the way,

461
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
tell Gu Yunnian to find

462
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,540
the secret edict

463
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,500
and destroy it.

464
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,460
After that, Liangxi took his own life.

465
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,900
The head eunuch of Jingxin Hall went missing too.

466
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,300
Your Majesty,

467
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,140
I'm guilty.

468
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,620
I knew the truth since ten years ago.

469
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,060
However, I didn't tell you the truth.

470
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,060
That's why the Di family and their 80,000 soldiers

471
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,900
suffered wrongful deaths.

472
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,820
I'm too ashamed to be the Princess of Jing.

473
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,900
Please punish me.

474
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,180
You were young back then.

475
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,900
Maybe you were mistaken.

476
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,900
Your Majesty,

477
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,380
that is indeed Anning's statement alone.

478
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,920
It's insufficient to convict
Her Majesty of such a crime.

479
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,820
However, the Grand Chancellor
of the Right did say

480
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,980
that the letter was written by Your Majesty.

481
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,380
Even if it's just an imitation,

482
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,460
there are only a few people in the world
who can achieve that.

483
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,300
Your Majesty, did you forget?

484
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,460
Before I became your tutor,

485
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,820
Her Majesty

486
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,820
was your tutor.

487
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,060
Wei Jian!

488
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,060
I did

489
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,020
write this letter.

490
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
I did

491
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,300
do the wrong thing.

492
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,980
So what?

493
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
The Di family

494
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,060
had too much military power for their own good.

495
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,700
They threatened their ruler's position.

496
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,460
I was deeply troubled by it.

497
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,180
However, the Emperor wasn't willing
to do the dirty deed

498
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,380
on account of his ties with Di Yongning.

499
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,540
I had to do it

500
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
for the sake of the world!

501
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,620
If anyone has the guts,

502
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,220
you may take me to the Imperial Clan Court
and put me on trial.

503
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,060
I will wait for him!

504
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,420
Your Majesty!

505
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,380
Please uphold justice for the people

506
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,300
so that the laws of Jing State
will not be trampled upon!

507
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,740
Your Majesty, please practice wise judgment

508
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,380
and interrogate the culprit

509
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,300
to uphold the laws of the nation!

510
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,100
Your Majesty, please practice wise judgment

511
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,900
and interrogate the culprit

512
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,860
to uphold the laws of the nation!

513
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,860
The Di Troops

514
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,820
risked their lives

515
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,100
to contribute to the nation

516
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,180
just to create a peaceful nation for its people.

517
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,500
However, all of them had to die

518
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,340
just because the Empress Dowager

519
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,780
thought they had too much military power.

520
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,740
Your Majesty,

521
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,020
I don't need any consolations

522
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
or rewards.

523
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,180
I just hope that you can clear my family's name

524
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,820
and uphold justice for the people!

525
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Your Majesty, please clear the Di family's name!

526
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,900
Your Majesty, please uphold justice
for the Di family!

527
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,460
Please uphold justice for the 80,000 soldiers

528
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
and the people of the world!

529
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,100
Your Majesty, please uphold justice
for the Di family!

530
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,340
Please uphold justice for the 80,000 soldiers

531
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,780
and the people of the world!

532
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,780
Your Majesty, please uphold justice
for the Di family!

533
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,340
Please uphold justice
for the people of the world!

534
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,780
Your Majesty, please uphold justice
for the Di family!

535
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,260
Please uphold justice
for the people of the world!

536
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,500
I...

537
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
I'm the Emperor of Jing.

538
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,780
I will surely rectify the court
and show no favors to the noble.

539
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,420
I will not defend the Empress Dowager.

540
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,540
However,

541
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,860
I'm both the ruler of the nation and her son.

542
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,300
How could I neglect the fact
that she gave birth to me and raised me?

543
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,140
Your Majesty,

544
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,780
a sage once said that filial piety
is the way to rule

545
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,220
to promote the attitude of love and respect

546
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,820
so that the people can be loved and respected

547
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,300
as the people are the foundation of a nation.

548
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,620
Consolidating the hearts of the people

549
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,020
is the only way to obtain peace.

550
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,620
Your Majesty,

551
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,900
please think twice.

552
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Your Majesty, please think twice!

553
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,420
Your Majesty, please think for the people,

554
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,820
the world,

555
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,860
and the generations to come!

556
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,780
Your Majesty, please think for the people,

557
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,340
the world,

558
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,500
and the generations to come!

559
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,260
Fine.

560
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,220
I will lock myself up in the ancestral temple
for three days as punishment.

561
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,860
After three days,

562
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,460
I will give the Di family,

563
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,300
my subjects,

564
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,100
and the people an explanation.

565
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,140
I will ask you one more thing.

566
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,980
From now on,

567
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,500
what identity will you assume?

568
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,820
Ren Anle never existed in the first place.

569
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,420
From now on, there will only be Di Ziyuan.

570
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,420
All right.

571
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,860
From today onward,

572
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,260
there will only be Di Ziyuan
in the imperial court of Jing.

573
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,300
Ren Anle is no more!

574
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,020
You still

575
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,460
became Di Ziyuan in the end.

576
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,300
Your Highness, thank you

577
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,860
for verifying my identity.

578
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,700
I didn't do it for your sake.

579
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,340
I did it to uphold justice for the world.

580
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,980
Since I knew you were Di Ziyuan,

581
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,300
I would never try to hide your identity.

582
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,540
So, you didn't mind
giving yourself away in front of me

583
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,780
because you knew my personality well, huh?

584
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,500
Your Highness, you're a kind

585
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,780
and just person.

586
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,060
I'm sure you won't lie

587
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,820
when it comes to a serious matter like this.

588
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,700
Ziyuan,

589
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,220
let me ask you something.

590
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,780
Is this

591
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,700
truly everything you wanted?

592
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,300
Yes.

593
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,340
I planned for this since ten years ago

594
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,340
just to obtain this result.

595
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,780
So,

596
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,540
you approached me from the very beginning

597
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,580
just so you could achieve this today?

598
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,500
Back then,

599
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,740
the Han family did wrong the Di family.

600
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,380
Now,

601
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,900
justice has been upheld for the Di family.

602
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,380
If so, who will uphold justice for me then?

603
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,780
Back then,

604
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,980
I was trapped in Dai Mountain

605
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,500
for ten years on your behalf.

606
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,860
I had no freedom at all

607
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,540
while you enjoyed yourself out there.

608
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,380
Ten years!

609
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,980
For the past ten years,

610
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,020
I lived as if I was treading on thin ice.

611
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
Do you have any idea
about the kind of life I led before this?

612
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,180
I'm the true Di Ziyuan.

613
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,620
I'm

614
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,580
the true Crown Princess of Jing.

615
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,820
I suffered for ten years on your behalf.

616
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
Now, you came back

617
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,660
and told everyone that you're the true Di Ziyuan.

618
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,900
Well, who am I?

619
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,060
Who am I?

620
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,540
Do you think the entire world owes you?

621
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,900
Do you think the entire world owes you?

622
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,580
Di Cheng'en, you should head back.

623
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,020
Di Cheng'en?

624
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,500
Di Cheng'en...

625
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,860
No.

626
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,380
Di Cheng'en isn't my name.

627
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,340
That's a fake name.

628
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,260
My life is fake too.

629
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,140
Di Cheng'en isn't my name.

630
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,580
Who...

631
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,620
Who am I?

632
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,820
I'm not Di Ziyuan.

633
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,100
I'm not Di Cheng'en either.

634
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,700
Who am I?

635
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,500
Who am I then?

636
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,260
Who am I then?

637
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,500
Who am I?

638
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,140
Di Ziyuan.

639
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,100
I can finally address you by your real name now.

640
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,140
I think Ren Anle sounds better.

641
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,020
However, I think

642
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,980
I never lived up

643
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,300
to my name.

644
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,700
I've let my name down.

645
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,940
But it's good that we pulled through.

646
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,820
And you forced Han Zhongyuan
to redress the Di family's case

647
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,100
and clear their name.

648
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,420
And the Empress Dowager confessed to her crime.

649
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,260
We won.

650
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,380
Yes.

651
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,780
We won.

652
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,420
I can finally use the name Di Ziyuan again.

653
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,740
It's been tough on you.

654
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,180
I live and die for the Di family.

655
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,580
I have no regrets

656
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,580
as long as your wish can be fulfilled.

657
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,900
However, I've let down

658
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,780
too many people to achieve this goal.

659
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,260
Anning,

660
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,660
Han Ye,

661
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,700
and Di Cheng'en.

662
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,940
And

663
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,900
although Gu Yunnian is dead,

664
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,080
there are still many doubts surrounding
the incident on Huayuan Mountain.

665
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,580
I think there is more to his last words

666
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,380
than meets the eye.

667
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,500
The imperial court of Jing seems
to be hiding a complex series

668
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
of connections and ties
that I've never touched upon.

669
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,780
The nation will face another crisis.

670
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,180
Just like...

671
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,740
Ziyuan.

672
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,820
You don't need to worry too much.

673
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540
The Han family is in charge
of the current imperial court after all.

674
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,060
You don't need to take responsibility
for them all the time.

675
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,540
There's always a rainbow after the rain.

676
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,620
