and above all, the well-being of the people.

133
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,420
My father told me this when I was little.

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,660

No.

140
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,140
It isn't.

141
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,460
I don't believe you.

142
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,180
I don't believe

143
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,780
that the Di family has never wanted
to usurp the throne.

144
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,740
When I was a kid,

145
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,060
my father wanted me to get married.

146
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,140
I once asked him

147
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,420
whether my future groom

148
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,660
would like

149
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,540
my naughty character.

150
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,860
He told me

151
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,500
that you were there when I was born.

152
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,420
You even went

153
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
to the Residence of Marquis Jing'an
thrice a day for me.

154
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,660
You liked me very much.

155
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,340
I never understood

156
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,020
why my father didn't defend himself

157
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,820
before he committed suicide.

158
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Until

159
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,220
I recalled what he once told me.

160
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,300
He said

161
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,220
you had a big heart

162
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,420
and wisdom.

163
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,820
My father went to the grave

164

proving his loyalty to you.

165
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,500
He never doubted

166
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,020
that you were big-hearted

167
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,660
and wise.

168
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,780
We, the Di family,

169
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,780
have never coveted the throne.

170
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,220
Ironically,

171
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,220
not many are aware

172
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,940
that the Di family are loyalists,

173
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,180
except for yourself.

174
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,940
In time,

175
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,420
the trend of this world

176
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,940
will push you

177
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,820
and the Di family

178
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,820
to conquer the nation

179
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,300
and divide the land.

180
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,340
By that time,

181
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
how should my Crown Prince do?

182
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,660
How would the Jing

183
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,860
end up?

184
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,260
In your eyes,

185
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
the sin of the Di family

186
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,380
isn't in the present,

187
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,860
but on any day in the future.

188
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,340
I, Di Ziyuan, am willing to bow down to you.

189
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,620
Also, I can assure you

190
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,100
that the very day you've been worried about

191
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,460
would never come.

192
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm bowing down

193
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,740
because I don't want the tragedy of the Di family

194
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,100
to repeat.

195
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Also, for the long peace and harmony

196
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,580
of Jing and the people

197
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,100
as the Crown Prince wishes.

198
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,380
But

199
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
no one should decide

200
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,060
where Jinyan and I go.

201
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,740
[Fuling Mountain]

202
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,940
Ziyuan.

203
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,260
Why do you bring me here?

204
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,220
Greetings, Grand Aunt.

205
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,980
Grand Aunt?

206
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,660
Jinyan.

207
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,500
This is our grand aunt.

208
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,580
Greet her now.

209
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,180
Greetings, Grand Aunt.

210
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,060
Well, get up.

211
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,420
Good boy.

212
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,540
Gosh.

213
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,340
That kowtow was loud enough.

214
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,980
Ziyuan.

215
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,740
Why did your hair turn all white?

216
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,340
Descendants of the Di family

217
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,740
are always on a bumpy road.

218
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,700
I asked Jian Song
to deliver the hairpin over a long time ago.

219
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,740
What took you so long to come here?

220
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,420
I had a long sleep.

221
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,260
By the way,
I didn't expect Jian Song would still be alive.

222
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,700
I saved him.

223
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,540
And he wants to serve
by my side lifelong in return.

224
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,660
What a grateful guy.

225
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,740
Ziyuan.

226
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,660
You've done well all these years.

227
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
I'm glad

228
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,420
to have you in the Di family.

229
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,940
Grand Aunt.

230
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,180
Ziyuan.

231
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,860
Come here.

232
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,460
Look at the capital of the Jing.

233
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,100
How's the view?

234
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,980
It looks different from the seabound Jingnan.

235
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,940
The capital is magnificent.

236
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,220
The first time I overlooked this land

237
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,580
was with Han Zi'an.

238
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,340
Rivers and mountains

239
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,180
stretch out into infinity with dynamics.

240
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Back then,

241
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,260
both Zi'an and I made a vow.

242
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,500
We want to establish
a peaceful and prosperous reign

243
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,940
on this land

244
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,180
alongside each other,

245
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,460
forever and in faith.

246
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,060
However,

247
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,180
he left me.

248
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,660
And that ended when we were together.

249
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,700
We could never stand beside each other,

250
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,620
even if he hadn't passed away.

251
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,580
But it's different for you and Han Ye.

252
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,980
As long as he's still alive,

253
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,860
you can continue your journey together.

254
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,740
The waiting might be long,

255
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,980
but there's still hope.

256
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,140
Grand Aunt.

257
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,380
I'll bring him back.

258
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,860
Good.

259
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
If you're tired of waiting for him

260
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,380
one day,

261
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,580
come here.

262
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,220
You're welcome here at any time.

263
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,580
Grand Aunt.

264
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,500
How about me?

265
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,260
You?

266
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,820
You can come here too.

267
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,420
But on one condition.

268
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,180
Every time you come,

269
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,580
you must kowtow to me thrice

270
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,940
as loud as you did just now.

271
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,740
Silly boy.

272
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
(I'm not alone now.)

273
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,140
(But I've lost you.)

274
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,740
(Han Ye.)

275
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,540
(Where are you now?)

277
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,820
You're awake.

278

Who are you?

279
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,980
Where am I?

280
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
I'm Mo Shuang.

281
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,740
Well...

282
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,140
We're in a bamboo cottage.

283
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Princess Mo Shuang?

284
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,940
Yes, it's me.

285
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,340
What time is it now?

286
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,060
Why didn't you light a candle?

287
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,860
Light a candle?

288
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,460
It's in the middle of the day.

289
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,220
Why do we need that?

290
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,980
Daytime?

291
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,020
Wait...

292

(And I)

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,780
(have become)

299
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,060
(the last orphan of the family.)

300
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,020
(I'm still alive.)

301
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,300
(As long as I'm alive,)

302
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,700
(the Di family stays alive.)

303
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,060
(I thought that my only wish)

304
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,900
(was to clear my family's name.)

305
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,700
(After the war in Qingnan Mountain,)

306
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,620
(only then did I realize my greed.)

307
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,780
(Aside from rectifying
the false accusation against my family,)

308

(But, Han Ye,)

310
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,900
(you fended off enemy intrusion)

311
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,540
(and protected the people and their houses.)

312
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,220
(You traded yourself for a truce,)

(But you)

316
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,100
(didn't leave yourself a way out
so you could leave the mountain alive.)

317
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,980
It turns out

318
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,540
you never planned

319
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,860
to meet with me alive.

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,330

Ye!

324
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,700
Are you all right?

325
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,340
Yes.

326
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,540
I'm good.

327
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,740
I can walk just well.

328
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,420
I'm to blame.

329
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,540
It's me

330
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,780
who put you through this.

331
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,420
My eyes and legs got hurt

332
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,140
because I fell off the cliff.

333
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,660
It has nothing to do with you.

334
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,420
The war between the two nations broke out

335
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,260
because I faked my own death.

336
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm the culprit of this war

337
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,500
and I caused the death of Anning.

338
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,020
Back in Jing,

339
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,340
Anning treated me so kindly.

340
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,940
She taught me horse-riding

341
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,940
and sent me desserts.

342
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,940
Since I learned of her death,

343
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,180
I could see her smiling face

344
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,540
whenever I close my eyes at night.

345
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,420
Her smile was beautiful

346
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,580
and brilliant.

347
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,140
Everything you've done is for Northern Qin,

348
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,620
and Anning and I did that for the sake of Jing.

349
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,900
It's our responsibility.

350
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,180
Don't feel guilty toward me and Anning,

351
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,220
but toward the people of two nations

352
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,060

You're right.

The war has ended,

357
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,300
but many people are left high and dry.

380
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,900
Have a taste.

381
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,860
But it matters to me.

382
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,860
Have you planned for the future yet?

383
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,500
Are you going back to Jingnan?

384
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,300
If you are,

385
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,700
you can

386
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,100
live a carefree life there like Ren Anle.

387
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,540
After all, the capital is a place full of chaos.

388
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,700
But I'm not Ren Anle,

389
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
I'm Di Ziyuan.

390
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,420
Besides, I won't go anywhere

391
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,100
before Han Ye is found.

392
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,540
Over the years,

393
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,140
I've always taunted Han Ye.

394
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,620
But he has never once used his status

395
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,620
to oppress me.

396
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,100
He's gone now,

397
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,220
and that really weirds me out.

398
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,180
You grew up together.

399
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,820
Though you're not close,

400
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,020
at times, I feel

401
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,780
that you know each other the best.

402
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,540
We have different personalities,

403
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,100
but we're connected deep inside.

404
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,020
Ziyuan.

405
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
I always have the feeling

406
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,660
that Han Ye is still alive.

407
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,260
I think so too.

408
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,780
The more we can't find him,

409
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,500
the more I believe he isn't dead.

410
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,100
If there's still no sign of him these few days,

411
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,540
I'll go and search for him myself.

412
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,940
Your current health

413
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,860
can't afford an arduous journey.

414
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,420
I can't wait anymore.

415
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,780
All right.

416
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,340
If you insist,

417
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,660
please take care.

418
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,700
[Ren's Residence]

419
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,380
The men of the Di Troops

420
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,130
have risked their lives

421
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,740
generation after generation

422
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,740
to create a peaceful and prosperous nation
for the people.

423
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,610
But all of them were eliminated

424
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,500
because the Empress Dowager was suspicious
of their loyalty

425
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,810
due to their powerful troops.

426
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,900
You're the future ruler.

427
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,770
His Majesty made so much effort

428
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,050
to groom you as his successor.

429
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,500
But now, Ziyuan

430
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,740
is as influential as you.

431
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,700
His Majesty will never spare her.

432
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,700
The men of the Di Troops

433
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,180
was eliminated

434
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,580
because of the Empress Dowager's suspicion.

435
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,820
Now, Ziyuan is as influential as you.

436
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,580
His Majesty will never spare her.

437
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,140
Ziyuan!

438
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,660
Ye!

439
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,260
Did you have a bad dream?

440
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,220
Don't worry.

441
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,220
Everything is over.

442
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
Just now,

443
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,300
you were calling Anle's name.

444
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,140
You must be missing her so much.

445
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,980
Why do affectionate couples

446
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,220
end up separated?

447
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,220
We were born into two confronting families.

448
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,180
Perhaps this is our fate.

449
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,980
This is the medicine for today.

450
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,580
Thank you.

451
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,980
I'm sorry.

452
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,060
I can't heal your eyes.

453
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,820
It's fine.

454
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,660
You may leave

455
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
some days later.

456
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,140
No.

457
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,060
You haven't recovered yet

458
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,740
and can't see anything.

459
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,340
You need someone to look after you.

460
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,660
Princess Mo Shuang.

461
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,020
Thank you for saving my life.

462
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,980
I'm greatly indebted

463
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,060
to you.

464
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,460
But...

465
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,380
Ye.

466
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,380
I know

467
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,340
you don't want to see me again.

468
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,980
But you have gone blind.

469
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,540
You can't sustain

470
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,980
without my help.

471
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,300
I'll look after you

472
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,820
until your eyes heal up

473
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,500
or

474
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,740
until the day Anle comes to fetch you.

475
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,740
Did you send news about me out?

476
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,500
No.

477
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,740
After the war,

478
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,140
Northern Qin and Jing
have no longer had any contact.

479
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,660
I can't deliver any messages.

480
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,300
I daren't tell my brother about you as well.

481
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,580
Princess Mo Shuang.

482
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,060
Can you do me a favor?

483
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,140
Yes.

484
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,940
Please tell.

485
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,060
I will help you.

486
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,220
Please

487
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,900
don't tell anyone that I'm still alive.

488
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,340
But why?

489
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,100
All right.

490
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,940
[Yuchen Hall]

491
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,100
Where is Di Ziyuan now?

492
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,460
Any news on her?

493
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,980
Your Majesty.

494
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,500
A few days ago, she took Di Jinyan
and went out of town.

495
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,500
They went to

496
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,140
Fuling Mountain.

497
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,700
Fuling Mountain?

498
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,740
She's back.

499
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,780
Zhao Fu.

500
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,100
I want to get changed right now.

501
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,460
I'm going to meet her.

502
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,220
Your Majesty.

503
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,380
You're the monarch.

504
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,980
Instead,

505
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,740
the head of the Di family should come to you.

506
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,260
No.

507
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,820
I must go and meet her.

508
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,180
There's a question

509
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,020
that I need an answer from her.

510
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,820
Your Majesty.

511
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,900
Your Majesty!

512
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,900
You haven't changed at all.

513
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,820
But you've changed a lot.

514
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,580
You're not that young brat you were.

515
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,220
Over the years,

516
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,980
you've done quite well.

517
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm not young anymore.

518
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,740
Ever since I ascended to the throne,

519
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,380
I've toiled

520
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,700
and been walking on thin ice.

521
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,220
Because I want to prove to everyone

522
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,180
that I can be a good emperor.

523
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,580
If Han Zi'an

524
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,460
can witness the current Jing,

525
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,500
he'd rest in peace.

526
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,700
I thought he would say

527
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,900
that Di Yongning would do way better than me

528
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,460
in governing the nation

529
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,980
by hundreds and thousands of times!

530
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,940
What gives you that idea?

531
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,220
It's not my idea!

532
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,980
To you two,

533
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,420
the most suitable owner of this nation

534
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,300
is Di Yongning.

535
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,820
If it weren't for you and the late Emperor

536
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,900
who issued an edict
to remove me from the position,

537
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,940
I wouldn't have been ruinously wary of Yongning.

538
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
It's the pair of you!

539
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,660
You drove me into a corner!

540
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,580
No.

541
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,980
There was no such edict.

542
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,700
As if!

543
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,820
You two said...

544
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,500
Han Zhongyuan.

545
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,100
The Jing State had finally settled down

546
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,580
after sedulous efforts.

547
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,900
But your father was seriously ill,

548
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,020
leaving him with limited time

549
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,180
to teach you to become a ruler.

550
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,860
Despite this,

551
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,620
he had made the most comprehensive plan for you.

552
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,500
Sadly,

553
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,380
in spite of

554
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,980
countless plans,

555
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,380
we never expected you

556
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,100
to be so selfish and suspicious,

557
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,460
and it led to discord
between you and your subordinates.

558
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,580
In the end, the tragedy of the Di family occurred.

559
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,340
If he did consider me,

560
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,260
why did he grant you

561
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,540
the right to dethrone the ruler?

562
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,900
Throughout my reign,

563
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,260
I've been looking over my shoulder,

564
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,220
like walking on eggshells.

565
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,460
And now, you tell me

566
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,020
that the late Emperor

567
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,140
had planned everything to secure my place.

568
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,780
This is ridiculous, indeed!

569
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,900
That year,

570
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,340
the entire Di family was executed,

571
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,500
Yongning took his life,

572
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,300
and Ziyuan was confined on Dai Mountain.

573
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,340
Everyone thought I was dead.

574
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,540
Given my personality,

575
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,540
I would've fought my way to the capital
and made you pay for it.

576
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,540
But

577
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,380
I didn't.

578
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,060
Have you ever thought

579
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,420
about why I never set foot in the capital?

580
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,660
Because

581
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,180
I've promised Han Zi'an

582
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,460
that I'd never

583
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,100
step into the capital for the rest of my life.

584
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,820
No.

585
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,820
It can't be.

586
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,780
I don't believe you.

587
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,060
This is impossible!

588
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,380
Go and look at the Ebony Green Iron Sword.

589
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,500
The answer

590
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,260
is inside it.

591
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,140
Zhao Fu.

592
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,660
Bring my sword here.

593
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:56,980
Yes.

594
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,260
Your Majesty.

595
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,180
[Imperial Edict: From the day of my death on,]

596
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,580
[Di Shengtian shall never enter the capital.]
(The edict I saw that year)

597
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,620
(wasn't to get me stripped of my title.)

598
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,580
(Instead, the late Emperor)

599
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,300
(wanted to secure my throne.)

600
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,780
Your Majesty.

601
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,100
(Han Zhongyuan.)

602
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,900
Now only I realized this.

603
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,900
(You)

604
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,580
have always been the ruler of Jing

605
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,100
both Zi'an and I invested in.

606
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,100
I...

607
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,740
I was wrong.

608
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,660
What are you doing?

609
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,060
I went to the market earlier today.

610
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,540
I saw wishing lanterns in various designs there.

611
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,060
So, I bought some materials to make one.

612
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,980
I heard

613
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,820
that if we release

614
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,260
a handmade wishing lantern to the sky,

615
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,980
immortals high up there

616
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,140
can hear our wish

617
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,100
and make it come true.

618
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,140
So I'm thinking of making one.

619
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,660
I'll make a wish upon it

620
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,820
that you can see again.

621
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,060
Thank you.

622
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,500
Where did you learn this skill from?

623
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,780
From the capital.

624
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,100
When I first saw this wishing lantern,

625
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,460
I was in the capital of Jing.

626
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,620
The vendor told me

627
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,780
such wishing lanterns answer all prayers.

628
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,980
What was your wish then?

629
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,500
At that time,

630
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,820
I prayed to Heavens

631
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,380
that we could break off the engagement.

632
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,340
Because

633
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,980
my brother said you looked ugly.

634
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,420
So I didn't want to marry you.

635
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,780
But when I saw your face,

636
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
I realized

637
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,300
that you have a delicate appearance.

638
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm sorry.

639
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,620
I shouldn't bring him up in front of you.

640
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,620
May I have a wishing lantern?

641
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,260
Sure.

642
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,620
You need to write your wish

643
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,900
on the lantern

644
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:57,820
so that

645
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,980
immortals can see it.

646
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,860
I will.

647
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,180
Thank you.

648
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,340
All right.

649
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,820
I'm done.

650
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,620
What's your wish?

651
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,980
Let's release the lantern.

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,140
