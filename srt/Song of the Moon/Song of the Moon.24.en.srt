[Episode 24]

4
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,380
It was all because of me

5
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,660
and my Sun Spirit

6
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,170
that Luo Ge was injured so badly.

7
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,940
Is it really wrong for me

8
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,100
to stay by his side?

9
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,500
Come with me.

10
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,100
Things have changed a lot

11
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,540
these days.

12
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,300
You may not have noticed

13
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,579
that sunglow has been appearing in Xiyin Mountain

14
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,300
for several days.

15
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,500
Sunglow is an ominous sign.

16
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,600
♫The begonia is red, but every promise makes it more withered♫

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,860
They represent danger or suffering.

18
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,100
Since they appeared in Xiyin Mountain,

19
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,450
♫It blooms alone, but the wind and rain are more violent♫

20
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,060
it means that something bad

21
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,980
will happen to Luo Ge.

22
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,030
♫Plants are not human beings, and ruthless fruits are planted♫

23
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,660
Ge

24
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,060
is the only Immortal in Immortal Palace.

25
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,740
I don't want him

26
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,460
to be hurt again.

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,010
♫How can you forget the innocence and ignorance when we first met?♫

28
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,370
You should also understand

29
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,980
how painful Ge is now

30
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,620
because of your Sun Fragments.

31
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,310
♫The butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, but it is difficult to fly to the sky♫

32
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,940
Don't you feel sad

33
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,780
to see someone you love suffer because of you?

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,000
♫The butterfly's wings were broken, and the dream fell without a trace♫

35
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,350
♫Because of their greed for the warmth of fire, they lost each other♫

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,500
♫There is a period of youth, and he is waiting for the spring breeze in the coming year♫

37
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
Please

38
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,460
cut off his affection.

39

♫How many times do we have to reincarnate♫

40
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,579
I don't want to

♫Before we meet again in the next life?♫

42

♫I exiled my thousand-year-old body♫

53
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,540
One of you cares about all living beings,

54
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,700
while the other one disrupts the Three Realms.

55
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,500
You are no longer him.

56
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,240
♫Waiting for the ashes to slowly burn in the heart♫

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,580
If you don't believe me,

58
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,900
you can see it yourself.

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,620
I will kill you

60
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,000
♫Wait until the end of life to see the begonia turn red again♫

61
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,180
even if I will be devastated to death by the Moon Sword.

62
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,980
Fu,

63
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,180
where are you going?

64
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,580
Would you believe me

65
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,700
if I said something happened to my race?

66
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,740
What's your reason?

67
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,700
There is no reason.

68
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,580
It is the place where I grew up.

69
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,100
My brother and I will definitely feel it

70
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,780
if something happens there.

71
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,180
I see.

72
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,340
I can live for two hours without water,

73
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,940
but my people

74
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,700
will definitely die without water.

75
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,580
If something really happens,

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,300
they can't even escape.

77
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,300
Will you come back

78
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,060
after you leave?

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,900
As soon as I confirm that Demon Palace is fine,

80
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,940
I'll be right back.

81
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,620
This way.

82
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,260
It is

83
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,220
the seawater from our Xiyin Mountain,

84
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,980
which is connected to the sea of the human world.

85
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,060
If you become invisible in the water,

86
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,620
the people from Immortal Palace

87
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,860
won't see you.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,900
However,

89
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,620
you must come back

90
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,860
before sunset.

91
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,100
What if I don't come back?

92
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,540
If you don't come back...

93
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,100
It seems

94
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,740
that I can't do anything to you.

95
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,900
But,

96
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,340
no matter what your choice is,

97
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,260
I will never regret

98
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,780
the decision I made.

99
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,260
Luo Ning,

100
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,300
thank you.

101
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,100
Fu,

102
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,740
we'll soon find out

103
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,140
if you're trustworthy or not.

104
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,700
I thought Liu Shao was seriously injured,

105
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,620
so

106
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,300
I allowed her to recuperate in Feiyuan House for a few days.

107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,380
Ge,

108
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,860
your spiritual power has been severely damaged this time,

109
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,700
and it may hurt your spiritual root.

110
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,409
You should stop seeing her again.

111
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,020
Sometimes...

112
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,740
I know.

113
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,060
I won't see her again.

114
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,580
Haven't you found her yet?

115
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,260
It's sunny today.

116
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,300
Is it so difficult for you

117
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,100
to find her?

118
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,100
Master,

119
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,330
we will definitely sense her aura,

120
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,460
if she's still alive.

121
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,300
She must have died

122
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,370
and her body has been eaten by fish.

123
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,420
I won't believe that

124
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,380
she would die so easily.

125
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,780
If she really died,

126
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,980
there would definitely be demonic aura scattered around.

127
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,980
There's no way we can't find any clues.

128
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,460
I'm just afraid

129
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,020
that someone has already taken her out of Xiyin Mountain,

130
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,100
or used some kind of methods

131
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,740
to hide her aura.

132
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,740
Then... now...

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,620
Hurry up and send more people to find her.

134
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,740
Don't slack off.

135
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,300
Yes.

136
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,660
Brother,

137
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,890
did you hear me?

138
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,370
Yes.

139
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,020
Brother.

140
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,620
What's wrong with Liu Shao being here with you?

141
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,380
I don't understand

142
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,940
why they wouldn't let her see you.

143
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,500
Brother, don't you think

144
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,660
you've really come back to life

145
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,020
since she came to Xiyin Mountain?

146
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,180
So,

147
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,460
I haven't been alive

148
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,620
in the past thousand years, have I?

149
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,660
No.

150
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,340
Well...

151
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,620
Only when there is lights in your eyes

152
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,540
and a smile on your face,

153
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,020
you are really alive.

154
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,290
Brother,

155
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,660
hasn't your Wang Bell been given to Liu Shao?

156
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,140
Why did you take it back?

157
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,500
I really shouldn't take back

158
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,580
what has been given to others.

159
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,660
Give it to her for me.

160
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,620
No.

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,380
Go by yourself.

162
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,660
Are you going or not?

163
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,900
No.

164
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,060
Demon King?

165
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,100
Immortal.

166
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,980
I can give her this Wang Bell

167
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,820
for you.

168
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,370
This is the herbal tea from Xiyin Mountain Garden.

169
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,380
Wan Sui said that it is imbued with the aura of heaven and earth,

170
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,540
and drinking it can improve one's cultivation.

171
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,500
You left in a hurry that day.

172
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,060
Are you okay?

173
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,380
I've been worrying about you.

174
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,180
I'm fine.

175
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:08,940
Really.

176
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,460
What happened to your hand?

177
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,060
Nothing.

178
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,260
What's wrong?

179
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,140
Why

180
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,900
do you drink tea with your left hand?

181
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,020
That's because

182
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,540
when I was practicing

183
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,820
the imperial flute recently,

184
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,700
I always felt that my left hand was not flexible enough.

185
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,340
So Mr. Tai asked me to practice my left hand.

186
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,660
Do you

187
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,250
have any plans for the future?

188
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,420
Go home.

189
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,980
I miss my home

190
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,740
and my parents.

191
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,260
Don't worry.

192
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,580
This is Immortal's natal artifact

193
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,180
that he asked me to give you.

194
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,700
Since I have decided to leave,

195
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,450
I can't take it.

196
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,780
Do you still blame him?

197
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,220
No.

198
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,380
That's my own decision.

199
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,740
I just hope

200
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,580
he can be fine.

201
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,340
You can take this Wang Bell,

202
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,580
so that

203
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,780
he won't feel too guilty maybe.

204
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,860
And you can go find me at Demon Palace,

205
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,420
if you ever feel lonely in the future.

206
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,860
Speaking of

207
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
my Demon Palace,

208
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,540
there is still a lack of a Demon Queen.

209
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,060
He Na...

210
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,700
I...

211
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,580
Just kidding.

212
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,570
Anyway, remember

213
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,180
that you are not alone.

214
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,700
At least in Demon Palace,

215
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,650
you can always take me as a friend.

216
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,860
Brother.

217
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,140
I felt that something happened to our people,

218
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,980
and that made me very worried.

219
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,380
Now it seems that nothing happened.

220
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,540
After all, you're here.

221
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,090
Those little demons are nothing.

222
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,260
I knew you would be worried.

223
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,620
That's why I would go to Immortal Palace to see you

224
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,980
as soon as it was over,

225
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,780
to tell you not to worry.

226
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,060
I didn't expect you to come back.

227
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,740
The Dan Tangerine at the door just happened to grow fruit.

228
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,060
I knew you like it,

229
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,340
so I brought you a few.

230
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,300
It feels so good at home.

231
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,340
There was Luo Ge's Protection Spell

232
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,620
where you were trapped,

233
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
how did you escape?

234
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,420
If I really want to escape,

235
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,540
no spell can stop me.

236
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,380
I made an agreement with Immortal Palace

237
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,940
that I can take you home

238
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,180
after I recover the Four Demons.

239
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,530
That day will come soon.

240
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,980
Don't act rashly

241
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,100
to cause trouble anymore.

242
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,380
So if I say

243
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,090
I'm not going back to Immortal Palace,

244
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,380
will you send me back anyway?

245
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,860
Just eat those tangerines.

246
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,620
What happened to your hand?

247
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,060
The spiritual veins of your hand have been destroyed,

248
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,060
and the meridians have been broken.

249
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,060
How could it happen?

250
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,580
Could it be that eagle demon did it?

251
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,540
Impossible.

252
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,540
He should be much weaker than you.

253
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,940
I accidentally caused it.

254
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,180
It's okay, Fu.

255
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,620
Even if one of my hands is destroyed,

256
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,580
I can still bring you back.

257
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,860
I remember you like this too.

258
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,820
But every year,

259
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,220
you would leave the biggest and sweetest ones to me.

260
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,300
I'll do as you say if you want me to go bcak to Immortal Palace.

261
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,620
I'll deal with

262
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,700
the rest of these little demons.

263
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,140
I'll be sure to find out

264
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,580
who else was involved in hurting your arm.

265
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,420
Will he come back?

266
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,120
♫In the sea of clouds, I looked at the reflection of the moon in the water♫

267
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,860
Kill him!

268
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,290
♫I kept waiting and arched my palms into a circle♫

269
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,110
♫The reflection gradually reminded me of our first meeting♫

270
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,000

♫I have no other choice♫

275
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,030
♫He said that responsibility and love are difficult to balance♫

276
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,870
♫He had no choice but to leave me♫

♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

280

When you come back,

281
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,820
I will definitely teach you a lesson.

282

♫Have shattered my dreams♫

283

♫I want to burn myself to hear you say that you have never changed♫

Demon King!

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,420
Don't kill me!

289
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,780

♫For billions of years♫

294

♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

298

♫Have shattered my dreams♫

No.

301

But I can't guarantee

302
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:25,020
♫Who would like to take a broken willow branch, and watch the moon alone in the blue sky♫

303

that I won't tear you apart

304
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,339
and feed the fish in my pond.

305
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,819
Even if you feed countless fish,

306
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,180
none of them

307
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,540
will be able to help you with your homework.

308
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,339
You seem

309
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,780
to be right.

310
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,140
But

311
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,980
you're still two hours late.

312
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,380
Tell me.

313
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,540
How do you want me to punish you?

314
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,940
Do whatever you want.

315
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,820
I won't fight back.

316
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,980
What?

317
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,300
Were you thinking of fighting back?

318
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,660
I wouldn't dare.

319
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,580
Here.

320
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,940
I brought you something good.

321
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,060
What happened to your hand?

322
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,490
It's fine

323
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,740
that you sneaked out.

324
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,820
But how could you fight

325
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,900
with others

326
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,500
and get hurt?

327
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,780
You are too weak.

328
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,090
It won't happen again.

329
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,940
I will definitely defeat them next time,

330
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,220
so that they don't have any chance to hurt me.

331
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,420
What are you talking about?

332
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,660
I'm telling you not to fight with others.

333
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,650
I am not asking you to compete with others.

334
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,820
Fine.

335
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,380
I won't.

336
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,140
Here.

337
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,340
Have some Dan Tangerines.

338
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,580
This Dan Tangerine tree

339
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,020
was planted

340
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,460
for me by my brother 900 years ago.

341
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,820
Half of the fruit from this tree

342
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,340
will be sent to me.

343
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,170
So

344
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,020
you like to eat this kind of small tangerines?

345
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,540
Actually, it's not me who likes it.

346
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,860
Here's the story.

347
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,260
A long time ago,

348
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,180
my brother once swallowed a Pearl of Fire for me.

349
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,700
He was suffering at the time

350
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,940
and had no appetite for anything.

351
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,580
But one day,

352
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,060
I saw him eat a whole Dan Tangerine,

353
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,340
so I was very happy.

354
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,140
Then I went out to look for it.

355
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,780
After I found an orchard,

356
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,170
I forced them

357
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,500
to cut down all the fruit trees in the orchard

358
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,900
and plant Dan Tangerines only.

359
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,220
And then?

360
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,420
Then my brother scolded me.

361
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,020
From then on, he mistakenly thought that I like to eat Dan Tangerine,

362
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,780
and even planted a Dan Tangerine tree in my house.

363
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,140
You should know

364
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,580
that it is not easy to grow this kind of tree

365
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,020
in the demon world.

366
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,260
He must have

367
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,540
put a lot of effort into

368
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,540
getting our Dan Tangerine tree

369
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,700
to grow and bear fruit.

370
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,290
You were weird too.

371
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,700
In that case,

372
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,460
why didn't you explain it to your brother?

373
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,690
Of course I can't give in

374
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,020
since he scolded me.

375
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,380
I'm different from you.

376
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,620
If my brother scolds me,

377
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,050
I will give in immediately,

378
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,500
and then act cute to him.

379
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,620
That way

380
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,220
he'll listen to me in everything.

381
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,140
How is your brother?

382
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,660
I heard something happened to Palace Chonghua today.

383
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,780
Exactly.

384
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,130
Even Liu Shao

385
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,420
was imprisoned in the furnace by Bai Feng.

386
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,460
But

387
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,260
fortunately your brother arrived in time

388
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,180
and saved her.

389
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,780
So she was safe at last.

390
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,260
My brother?

391
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,340
It turned out

392
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,540
that my brother was injured by the spirit fire in Immortal Palace,

393
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,260
so he was attacked by that eagle demon.

394
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,860
Luo Ge.

395
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,820
Liu Shao.

396
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,340
I will take revenge on you.

397
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,580
You are...

398
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,100
I am the one who once punished your people,

399
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,940
and the one who can save your people.

400
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,220
God of the Moonlight?

401
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,460
I'm Fu from Aquatic Demons.

402
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,940
Greetings, Supreme God.

403
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,740
I know that you have a lot of resentment.

404
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,700
So do I.

405
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,380
If you can lift the curse of my people,

406
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,940
I am willing to do everything

407
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,140
to eliminate all your resentment.

408
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,220
Good.

409
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,180
It just so happens that I want to borrow something from you

410
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,810
to facilitate my work tomorrow.

411
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,940
He actually absorbed 30% of my demon power.

412
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,940
But if he can really

413
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,020
bring chaos to Immortal Palace,

414
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,100
it will be worth it.

415
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,980
If you were just that mortal Lu Li,

416
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,900
and if only we could stay together forever

417
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,820
after we first met that day.

418
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,900
If I don't have the responsibility to protect all creatures in this world,

419
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,820
and if our spiritual power won't interfere with each other,

420
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,060
that would be great.

421
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,220
There is a barrier of fate

422
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,620
between us.

423
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,380
If we can be together,

424
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,500
I am willing to fight against the fate of the Three Realms.

425
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,860
But...

426
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,940
The one who would hurt you

427
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,620
is actually me.

428
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,340
How ridiculous.

429
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,980
The person I hurt

430
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,660
is the love of my life.

431
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,980
So I can only leave you.

432
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,060
I hated

433
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,220
and loved

434
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,660
this Immortal Palace.

435
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,540
Now we will separate

436
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,780
and forget about each other.

437
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,860
Who are you?

438
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,660
I am the complete you.

439
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,420
The Four Seasons Monument is still there,

440
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,290
all this is just my illusion.

441
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,700
Or should I say

442
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,420
illusions come from the heart?

443
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,380
Why don't you give up?

444
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,220
Why should I give up?

445
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,170
You cut off all your emotions

446
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,460
in order to become Immortal.

447
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,060
You met someone you like,

448
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,500
but you were afraid to express your love to her.

449
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,180
Then why do you still

450
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,650
want to be an Immortal?

451
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,580
I have been cultivating hard

452
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,410
for all beings

453
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,260
and the Three Realms.

454
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,620
My personal pursuits are nothing.

455
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,580
Cultivating hard?

456
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,580
If so,

457
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,940
what do you have in your hand?

458
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,140
What I can't escape, you can't escape either.

459
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,340
What I can't get, you can't get either.

460
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,860
What I have experienced,

461
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,620
you will also experience.

462
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,980
You will eventually become me.

463
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,980
No way.

464
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,780
What's the point of you cultivating hard to become an Immortal?

465
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,580
Even if you protect all living beings,

466
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,580
you'll lose yourself

467
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,940
and hurt

468
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,740
your loved ones.

469
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,820
This is...

470
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,290
Lu Sheng.

471
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,730
This is Soul-devouring Spell,

472
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,740
and I will plant it in your body.

473
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,580
If you are in love with Liu Shao,

474
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,500
you will trigger the spell to break out.

475
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,900
If you can't stop your love for Liu Shao,

476
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,660
this spell will make your blood flow backwards,

477
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,260
bring you extreme pain.

478
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,540
Soul-devouring Spell?

479
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,620
This is Lu Li's memory.

480
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,860
Impossible.

481
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,780
I really can't break

482
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,140
this Soul-devouring Spell.

483
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,220
It's just Soul-devouring Spell...

484
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Why...

485
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,140
Luo Ge.

486
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,620
Xiyin Mountain is falling.

487
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,660
Something happened to Luo Ge.

488
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,660
What I have experienced,

489
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,210
you'll experience too.

490
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,340
You will eventually become me.

491
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,140
Brother.

492
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,820
Luo Ge!

493
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,460
What happened?

494
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,450
Are you okay?

495
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,260
Luo Ge.

496
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,020
Liu Shao,

497
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,580
listen to me.

498
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,460
This evil spirit is getting stronger and stronger.

499
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,460
I was almost affected by it today.

500
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,300
I have to do something.

501
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,220
If I continue to ignore the vibration

502
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,210
of Xiyin Mountain,

503
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,100
I am afraid that all living beings in the Three Realms will be destroyed.

504
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,780
How could this happen?

505
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,380
No.

506
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,820
It shouldn't be like this.

507
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,980
As long as I don't bother you...

508
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,940
This has nothing to do with you.

509
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,900
I wanted to keep Lu Li's cultivation,

510
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,300
but I deliberately cut off Lu Li's emotions.

511
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Now,

512
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,530
I've been tormented by my heart demon.

513
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,060
Luo Ge.

514
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,380
Love will corrode the heart,

515
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,140
and emotion will corrode the bones.

516
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,020
It was all illusory,

517
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,260
but I couldn't get out of this predicament.

518
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,660
Then how can I be an Immortal?

519
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,580
Luo Ge.

520
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,180
Luo Ge!

521
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,140
Then let's just give up.

522
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,980
We can stop doing it anymore.

523
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,900
Let's go.

524
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,940
Let's go back, okay?

525
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,900
It's just that if this continues,

526
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,500
all beings in the Three Realms will be implicated by me.

527
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,580
Liu Shao,

528
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,700
just be yourself.

529
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,660
I have to face my responsibility

530
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,500
and go through the tribulation again.

531
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,740
Luo Ge!

532
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,860
Liu Shao.

533
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,260
Luo Ge.

534
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,860
Liu Shao.

535
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,180
Luo Ge.

536
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,580
God of the Moonlight.

537
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,580
How did you create this Soul-devouring Spell?

538
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,540
It forbids one to fall in love with another.

539
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,450
Luo Ge.

540
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,980
Luo Ge!

541
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,780
Luo Ge!

542
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,940
Luo Ge.

543
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,100
You have so much responsibility to take on.

544
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,820
This Soul-devouring Spell was given to you because of me.

545
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,300
I should be the one to take it.

546
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,780
Masters,

547
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,020
have something similar happened in the past?

548
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,020
Yes.

549
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,180
And it also caused chaos in Immortal Palace.

550
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,500
It will endanger the Three Realms.

551
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,140
How can we solve it?

552
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,140
It is said

553
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,700
that we can get Immortal back.

554
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,860
Or we can have another Immortal in Immortal Palace.

555
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,460
Greetings, Immortal Master.

556
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,820
What happened to Luo Ge this time

557
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,460
was his misfortune.

558
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,260
But if he can

559
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,180
get over his heart demon and come back,

560
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,500
he will definitely get stronger.

561
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,330
But when will he come back?

562
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,660
If he doesn't return,

563
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,860
who can solve the chaos in Xiyin Mountain?

564
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,700
If he's going to stay in the human world for another twenty years,

565
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,580
I'm afraid the Three Realms will become chaotic again.

566
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,100
Master Shang has been cultivating for a long time,

567
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,820
why not let him activate Xilun Formation,

568
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,220
so that he can become an Immortal immediately.

569
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,540
As long we have an Immortal here,

570
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,220
we can also solve many problems.

571
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,220
Xilun Formation is dangerous.

572
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,980
The person in the center of this formation will turn into stone at any moment.

573
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,060
We cannot activate it arbitrarily.

574
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,220
Report!

575
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,340
Master,

576
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,900
the cracks on the Four Seasons Monument have intensified,

577
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,540
and there is evil aura overflowing from the bottom of the monument.

578
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,700
Immortal Master, senior.

579
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,770
Masters.

580
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,820
Now is not the time to worry about other things.

581
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,180
It is important to unite everyone's strength

582
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,860
to seal this evil aura.

583
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,180
Okay.

584
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,370
Do you think I can't deal with you

585
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,060
if you go to the human world?

586
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,860
This little guy is really here.

587
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,300
Since you won't let me out,

588
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,620
I'll use the Son of the Demon King to collect divine spirit

589
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,380
to restore my strength.

590
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,260
I will make you pay

591
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,739
for sealing me for ten thousand years.

592
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,530
[Ao Hen's son, Ao Yin]

593
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,820
Luo Ge.

594
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,420
Where are you?

595
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,020
Why couldn't I find you

596
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,900
anywhere?

597
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,500
What?

598
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,810
[Marquis Wuyang's Mansion]

599
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,700
Brother?

600
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,220
Yes.

601
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,140
Has he been here?

602
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,220
No.

603
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,780
I know

604
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,460
that with the Moon Bell protecting you,

605
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,540
you'll be safe.

606
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,140
Luo Ge has never been here.

607
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,260
I will send men to find him.

608
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,820
Luo Ge.

609
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,300
I will find you.

610
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,180
No matter who you became this time,

611
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,340
I would definitely recognize you.

612
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,300
Wait for me.

613
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,420
The God of the Moonlight

614
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,860
is really amazing.

615
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,020
He only used 30% of my demon power

616
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,900
to make Luo Ge become like this.

617
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,500
Now Immortal Palace has been busy because of Four Seasons Monument.

618
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,380
Luo Ning.

619
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,860
What's wrong, Luo Ning?

620
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,170
Who bullied you?

621
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,100
Fu.

622
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,260
My brother has been missing for so long.

623
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,180
Could something really happen to him?

624
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,140
Don't worry.

625
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Luo Ge is an Immortal.

626
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,340
He can solve any problem.

627
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,980
But he disappeared without a trace.

628
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,460
We also don't know his whereabouts

629
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,660
in the human world.

630
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,660
Immortal Palace would definitely send someone to find him.

631
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,610
No.

632
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,540
I'm going to find him myself.

633
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,220
No.

634
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,580
You've never left here.

635
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,900
You have no idea of the dangers of the human world.

636
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,740
If your brother knew,

637
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,620
he would definitely not let you leave.

638
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,660
What if something happened to your brother?

639
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,100
I...

640
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,540
Luo Ning.

641
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,860
I'll go with you.

642
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,500
Yurong.

643
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,860
Thank you for your hard work today.

644
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,370
It's not a big deal.

645
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,020
It's just that we can't last too long

646
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,810
if we take turns to fix it like this.

647
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,940
If Luo Ge doesn't come back,

648
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,980
the situation

649
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,140
will get worse.

650
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,980
If Ge doesn't come back,

651
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,900
Immortal Palace

652
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,180
will still keep falling,

653
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,660
and the Four Seasons Monument will keep breaking.

654
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,780
Then we won't be able

655
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,540
to stop this demon from coming out.

656
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,620
Below Xiyin Mountain is the human world,

657
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,740
once it sinks,

658
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,580
the entire human world will be affected.

659
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,580
Besides,

660
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,820
the demon under the monument

661
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,300
once killed so many lives in the Three Realms ten thousand years ago.

662
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,380
Now there is not even someone to stop him.

663
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,820
Once he comes out,

664
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,700
he will definitely kill many lives again.

665
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,500
When Luo Ge first set this formation,

666
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,260
he made seven talisman pearls in Liu Shao's body.

667
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,140
Four were used up at the time,

668
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,300
and she still has three in her body now.

669
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,460
It should buy us some time

670
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,100
if we use magic to get them out.

671
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,060
But didn't Liu Shao

672
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,020
go to the human world with Luo Ge?

673
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,410
Before Liu Shao left,

674
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,280
I had left a mark on her.

675
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,500
We should be able to find her.

676
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,940
Take my fan. This suits you very well.

677
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,740
You're still here?

678
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,380
Hong.

679
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,300
Take mine.

680
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,340
There's a fool selling pearls by the Moon River.

681
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,140
It's interesting.

682
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,500
Let's go. I'll take you there.

683
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,340
Over there.

684
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,020
Moon River?

685
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,740
Could it be...

686
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,470
♫I ask the cloud and the flower♫

687
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,450
♫How I can stop missing you♫

688
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,710
♫I walk through the time♫

689
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,080
♫Whether we can forever♫

690
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,680
♫Love each other like now and carve this between our eyebrows♫

691
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,200
♫A white horse came and became a poem♫

692
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:16,920
♫Memory is beautiful and I am still loving you♫

693
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,040
♫In the vast blue sky, I prefer to pursue the moon♫

694
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,500
Why are you here?

695
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,940
We can catch the moon in the Moon River.

696
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,440
♫Do you know it?♫

697
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,260
Are you going or not?

698
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,030
♫Thousands of lights made it like a day♫

699
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,260
Is this the moon you mentioned?

700
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,300
Of course not.

701
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,580
Close your eyes.

702
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,130
♫It is like my heart where you are still there♫

703
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,660
Ready?

704
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:39,250
♫I am waiting. The moon is above the willow branch♫

705
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,220
How much

706
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,300
is this bracelet?

707
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,340
Miss.

708
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,260
♫I only want to hold your hands and count beans of love♫

709
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,380
This bracelet is unusual.

710
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,260
This bead

711
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,450
♫I am guarding you. A turning around♫

712
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,060
was raised by the lake demons

713
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,900
who gouged out one of their own eyes

714
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,780
and placed it in a golden clam for their own children.

715
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,520
♫Exchanges staying together forever♫

716
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,970
It will definitely help you ward off demons

717
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,210
and suppress evils.

718
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:01,760
♫The love is as before♫

719
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,020
How much is it?

720
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,860
It's not expensive.

721
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,660
One thousand taels.

722
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,220
You're talking nonsense.

723
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,020
Are you kidding?

724
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,740
You are making up stories to lie.

725
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,210
Yes.

726
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,260
Mr. Lu, let's go.

727
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,540
Mr. Shao, let's go.

728
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,660
I'm not lying.

729
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,340
You have no idea what you are missing.

730
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,460
Why do I feel

731
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,220
that someone will definitely buy it?

732
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,300
It's not worth one thousand taels at all.

733
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,170
♫Do you know it?♫

734
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,050
Five thousand taels.

735
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,750
♫Thousands of lights made it like a day♫

736
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,100
I'll have it.

737
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,850
♫It is like my heart where you are still there♫

738
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:42,970
♫I am waiting. The moon is above the willow branch♫

739
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,980
♫I only want to hold your hands and count beans of love♫

740
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,020
Don't let that lake demon

741
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,660
gouge out the other eye

742
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,180
♫I am guarding you. A turning around♫

743
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,900
to keep his child safe for the winter.

744
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,020
Miss.

745
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,240
♫Exchanges staying together forever♫

746
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,930
The one I've been waiting for

747
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:05,480
♫The love is as before♫

748
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,220
is you.
