Miss,

6
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,420
this bracelet is unusual.

7
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,180
This pearl is made of

8
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,740
the Lake Demon's eye.

9
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,340
She dug out one of her eyes for her children

10
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,170
and raised it in the golden clam.

11
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
It can repel demons and suppress evil spirits.

12
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,780
It will definitely work.

13
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,060
-Liar. -He made it up.

14
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,220
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,740
You know nothing.

16
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,020
Why do I think

17
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,460

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,820
5,000 taels.

19
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,860
I'll buy it.

20
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,780
Don't let the Lake Demon

21
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,420
dig out another eye

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,660
for her children in the winter.

23
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,700
Miss.

24
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,660

25

31
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780

32
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,660
I told someone

33
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,220
about the Lake Demon here.

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,620
I gave this pearl

35
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,260
to a girl.

36
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,460
That girl...

37
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,540
That girl is me.

38
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,450
My name is Liu Shao.

39

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,570
we might as well let go.

175
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,090
I'll take you to a place.

176
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,780
See for yourself how the Three Realms

177
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,540
need you.

178
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,220
I'll go help them.

179
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,180
This...

180
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,380
What should I do?

181
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,299
Well...

182
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,820
Should I do something?

183
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
It seems to be

184
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,770
like this.

185
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,220
It's useless.

186
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,380
Let me try again.

187
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,140
Brother.

188
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,260
Help...

189
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,740
Help me.

190
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,780
Do something

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,420
and send them away.

192
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,890
Okay.

193
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:22,940
Hurry up.

194
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,380
Hurry!

195
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:38,900
Liu Shao.

196
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,300
My sister-in-law is really amazing.

197
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,460
Brother.

198
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,260
You...

199
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,100
I remember

200
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,500
that's how it works.

201
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,020
Didn't sister-in-law say you went missing?

202
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,380
Why are you here?

203
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,610
You told me yesterday that you wanted to kill demons here.

204
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,780
I found him

205
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,690
and brought him here.

206
00:09:59,330 --> 00:09:59,900
Sister-in-law.

207
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,620
Liu Shao.

208
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,420
I saw you defeated them.

209
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,740
Are you okay?

210
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,460
Sister-in-law.

211
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,020
What's wrong with brother?

212
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:07,980
He...

213
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,420
He can't do it.

214
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,740
Something happened when Luo Ge was practicing.

215
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,460
He doesn't remember the past.

216
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,700
So

217
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,060
he can't do magic for now.

218
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,740
Who is your brother?

219
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,980
You.

220
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,810
Do you know

221
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,420
you almost killed me?

222
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,530
What?

223
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,900
Do you want your sister-in-law to be a widow?

224
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,980
Listen.

225
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,060
This tone

226
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,660
must be my brother's.

227
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,300
But...

228
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,500
What's going on?

229
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,740
Many people have been missing in the city these days.

230
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,780
Jian and I came to investigate this.

231
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,820
We found that some demons were killing people to get the vitality.

232
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,780
So we came to save people.

233
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,660
I didn't expect those demons are so cunning

234
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,740
and ambushed here.

235
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,780
I...

236
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,620
I didn't help much.

237
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,100
Looks like

238
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,300
I have to learn some magic.

239
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,100
I wanted to protect you guys, but now,

240
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,180
I can only rely on you to protect me.

241
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,140
Brother,

242
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,980
you have protected many people.

243
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,570
The whole human world

244
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,660
should thank you.

245
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,660
Liu Shao.

246
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,740
Master Shang.

247
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,340
You found him?

248
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,420
Who is this?

249
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,100
If he doesn't go back,

250
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,700
I don't know.

251
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,470
we'll be in trouble.

252
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,920
-You don't know him either? -He doesn't seem to remember anything.

253
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,180
No.

254
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,740
Please

255
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,940
tell the immortals that

256
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,940
I will take Immortal Luo Ge back

257
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,540
to the Immortal Palace safely.

258
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,260
Liu Shao,

259
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,380
who is this pretty?

260
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,380
He looks quite gentle.

261
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,340
But he's wearing too much make-up.

262
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,580
Luo Ge,

263
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,980
look at you.

264
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,100
You're still so mean.

265
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,540
Look carefully.

266
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,900
Look carefully.

267
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,740
I was born beautiful.

268
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,420
I don't wear makeup.

269
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,540
Master Shang,

270
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,780
are you here to catch up with us?

271
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,570
No.

272
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,620
I have something important

273
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,620
to ask you.

274
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,820
Please come with me.

275
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,780
Liu Shao.

276
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,130
What?

277
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,180
The evil spirit of the Four Seasons Monument is emitting again?

278
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,500
Yes.

279
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,900
Luo Ge is not here.

280
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,780
Only your Blood Amulet can

281
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,140
hold back these evil things.

282
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,260
I know.

283
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,380
How many are you going to take?

284
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,020
I will take one first.

285
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,660
It will work for three days.

286
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,140
I hope you can

287
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,060
help him

288
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,570
get him through the tribulation in three days.

289
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,300
Otherwise...

290
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,620
Liu Shao.

291
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,540
I know this is unfair to you.

292
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,060
If I had other ways,

293
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,890
I wouldn't have come to you.

294
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,170
Without Luo Ge,

295
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,060
can the talisman pearl suppress it?

296
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,100
A talisman pearl

297
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,420
can only last three more days for the Three Realms.

298
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,340
Just wait and see.

299
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,260
If Luo Ge doesn't come back

300
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,900
in three days,

301
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,650
the Four Seasons Monument will be completely out of control.

302
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,530
The Three Realms will be in chaos.

303
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,500
Take one first.

304
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,260
I'll try to help Luo Ge recall the past.

305
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,580
We can only rely on you

306
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,660
for the next three days.

307
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,740
Sorry.

308
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,980
Liu Shao.

309
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,570
Liu Shao.

310
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,340
Liu Shao.

311
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,460
Liu Shao.

312
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,140
Where are you?

313
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,060
Master Shang.

314
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,980
Please

315
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,140
cast a Silence Spell on me.

316
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,660
I'm afraid

317
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,620
I'll scream in pain.

318
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,500
He will be sad

319
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,300
when he hears my voice.

320
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,180
Okay.

321
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,460
This will be the fifth talisman pearl from you.

322
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,260
It will hurt your vitality.

323
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,060
You'd better

324
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,180
take good care of yourself after this.

325
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,210
Don't worry.

326
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,900
Liu Shao.

327
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,700
Liu Shao.

328
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,380
I can't even protect Liu Shao

329
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,700
with no power.

330
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,500
Is this the feeling?

331
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,860
Liu Shao.

332
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,700
Liu Shao.

333
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,740
What's wrong?

334
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,100
Why are you so weak?

335
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,340
Where have you been?

336
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,260
I’m fine.

337
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,980
I just talked to Master Shang

338
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,100
and fell down.

339
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,860
You fell?

340
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,330
Did you hurt yourself?

341
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,900
No.

342
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,980
Can you

343
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,420
carry me for a while?

344
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,260
Okay.

345
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,099
Did Luo Ge do anything to you?

346
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,300
He probably wants to kill me.

347
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,290
But

348
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
he has no power now.

349
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,300
There is nothing he can do.

350
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,140
You are showing off.

351
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,900
He will make you pay for this.

352
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,940
Seal it now.

353
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,460
Okay.

354
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,180
That pretty.

355
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,700
Isn't he asking for death?

356
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,340
My sister-in-law hurt so bad

357
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,420
after he took her out for a while.

358
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,260
Exactly.

359
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,180
Immortal Luo Ge.

360
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,420
When you regain your power,

361
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,530
you have to peel him.

362
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:43,900
Yes.

363
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,210
Hang him on the wall

364
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,980
for three days.

365
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,300
Yes.

366
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,420
I will.

367
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,100
I said it was me.

368
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,100
Greetings, Senior Lu.

369
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,420
Greetings, Immortal Luo Ge.

370
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,620
Liu Shao.

371
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,620
They are...

372
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,340
They are thanking you

373
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,820
for saving the mortal world.

374
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,980
Thank me?

375
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,410
The Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

376
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,820
was occupied by the Demon Realm.

377
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,820
The mortal world almost became a part of the Demon Realm.

378
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,140
You rebuilt

379
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,940
the Marquis Wuyang's Mansion by yourself

380
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,140
and gave the elites of the mortal world a place to recuperate

381
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,340
and rebuilt the order of the mortal world.

382
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:23,860
Yes.

383
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,620
My brother is the hero of the Three Realms,

384
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,700
the guardian of the Three Realms.

385
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,940
Get up.

386
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,570
Do you remember anything?

387
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,700
No.

388
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm just thinking

389
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,860
how a couple

390
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,740
live in the mortal world?

391
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,500
Wang Jian,

392
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,900
how did you

393
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,780
live?

394
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,620
Just like that.

395
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,490
You build a few huts,

396
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
do some farm work,

397
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,100
and raise a few ducks. Is it hard?

398
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,580
No, no.

399
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,740
That's good.

400
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,300
That's good.

401
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,260
That's good.

402
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:14,980
That's good.

403
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,140
Luo Ge.

404
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,500
When will you remember who you are?

405
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,580
I made a promise with the Immortal before.

406
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,460
After I subdue the Four Demons,

407
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,740
the Immortal will return Fu to me.

408
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,580
Now the Four Demons have been subdued

409
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,060
and have made me the king.

410
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,300
Please keep your promise.

411
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,780
Immortal is getting through the tribulation.

412
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,180
We can't decide

413
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,570
what he promised.

414
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,540
The thunder stroke

415
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,420
and the Xiyin Mountain is descending.

416
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,860
Is Immortal really getting through the tribulation?

417
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,580
He Na.

418
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,660
This is the Immortal Palace's business.

419
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,580
You crossed the line.

420
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,260
The Three Realms are related as a whole.

421
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,900
If there is any change in the Immortal Palace,

422
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,860
the Demons will be affected.

423
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,740
Fine.

424
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,220
The Immortal Palace will keep our promises.

425
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,220
Follow me.

426
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
He's not Fu.

427
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,060
We wanted to

428
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,500
free Fu back to the Demon Realm.

429
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,980
But he escaped.

430
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
This is different.

431
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,900
It belongs to Luo Ning.

432
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,540
Could it be that

433
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,180
she was abducted by your brother too?

434
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,820
It belongs to Fairy Luo Ning.

435
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,380
Don't worry.

436
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,460
I'll find Fu and ask him

437
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,060
and give you an explanation.

438
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,020
Hurry up! Hurry up!

439
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,380
Brother, sister-in-law.

440
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,700
Brother.

441
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,460
Chicken.

442
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,050
Rabbits.

443
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,060
Pomegranate tree

444
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,620
and peach blossoms.

445
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:37,860
Brother,

446
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,700
what you want

447
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,100
is like this, right?

448
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,060
Do you like it?

449
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,100
I've never lived in a place like this.

450
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,580
And I've never raised chicken and ducks.

451
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,940
But

452
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,260
I like it.

453
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,260
That's good.

454
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,620
Brother, sister-in-law,

455
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,140
you can stay here in peace from now on.

456
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,340
Xue,

457
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,820
let's cook some delicious dishes

458
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,820
to welcome them tonight.

459
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,460
No problem.

460
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,620
Let's go.

461
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,660
Slow down.

462
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,900
What should we cook?

463
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,660
Pick the vegetables.

464
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,300
How are you?

465
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,900
Are you feeling better?

466
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,780
I'm fine.

467
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,780
It's just that...

468
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,940
you still have a lot of responsibilities.

469
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,380
Luo Ge.

470
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
You're an immortal.

471
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,220
I'm a mortal.

472
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,570
I can't do magic.

473
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,420
Even if I can,

474
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,380
I will protect

475
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,450
the person I care about.

476
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
The Three Realms are too much.

477
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,740
I can't bear it.

478
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,540
Let's go.

479
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,140
Help them cook.

480
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,100
Let's go.

481
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,540
You see how cute

482
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,140
these two goats are.

483
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,460
Hurry up.

484
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,100
Keep up.

485
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,330
Is this the important thing you mentioned?

486
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,500
You've been weak lately.

487
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,300
When they grow up,

488
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,980
they can produce milk for you.

489
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,900
Let's live our life

490
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,100
in the yard.

491
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,940
I will plant some vegetables.

492
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,580
By then,

493
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,340
I'll plow the soil in the yard

494
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,860
and plant some vegetables.

495
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,180
The vegetables

496
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,460
must be very delicious.

497
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,060
Let's go.

498
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,820
You seem to remember what Lu Li promised me.

499
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,740
But if you can't remember Luo Ge's past,

500
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,380
how can you break the Soul-Devouring Spell?

501
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
I wonder where my brother is.

502
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,180
The mortal world is so big.

503
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,460
I don't know where to find him.

504
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,380
Immortal Luo Ge is blessed by God.

505
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,810
He will be happy

506
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,260
that you care about him.

507
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,130
Come on.

508
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,860
What do you like?

509
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,540
Take a look.

510
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,140
Take a look.

511
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
What do you want to buy?

512
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,220
Are you okay, Fu?

513
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,580
I'm fine.

514
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,420
Let's go.

515
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,060
Fu.

516
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,860
Look over there.

517
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,580
Let's go.

518
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,050
Go.

519
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:41,900
Go!

520
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,220
Miss! Miss!

521
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,210
Take mine.

522
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,740
My fan is good.

523
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,420
Mine is good.

524
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,220

702
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,020
make up for the damaged vitality.

703
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,540
Don't worry.

704
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,140
Fu.

705
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,020
Long time no see.

706
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,220
It's you.

707
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,900
God of the Moonlight.

708
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,700
I didn't expect you to be able to convey messages with your mind.

709
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,090
I have to

710
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,700
thank

711
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,980
the fairy with you.

712
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,060
Thanks to the half of her vitality,

713
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,460
it's more nutritious than thousands of the mortals.

714
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,980
It's really you.

715
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,620
I'm warning you.

716
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,700
Don't hurt Luo Ning again.

717
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,060
Also,

718
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,940
when you regain your power,

719
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,020
don't forget your promise.

720
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,820
Brat,

721
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,580
I will let you know

722
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,060
the difference between the king and the subordinate.

723
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,380
Good boy.

724
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,100
You feed the rabbits and goats

725
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,690
before breakfast?

726
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,060
I also checked

727
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,020
whether the seeds sprout.

728
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,530
Time passes so slowly.

729
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,500
It's only been two days.

730
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,610
It's been three days.

731
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Three days.

732
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,740
On the first day we met,

733
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,850
we rowed at Moon River

734
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,900
and then went to Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

735
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,940
You took me to the Moon Washing Pond yesterday.

736
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,370
What about today?

737
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,740
Where will we go today?

738
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,660
Wherever you want to go.

739
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,700
Do you remember anything these days?

740
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,540
Liu Shao.

741
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,940
I know you're trying

742
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,220
to remind me of the past.

743
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,460
But I've thought about it.

744
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,460
From the first day I came here,

745
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,300
I felt like I was looking for something.

746
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,940
But

747
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,420
I knew I found it from the moment I saw you.

748
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,100
I don't want to

749
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,060
be some immortal.

750
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,130
I just want to live with you like this.

751
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,780
Anything else?

752
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,540
Well,

753
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,420
Wang Jian wants to improve his skills.

754
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,180
He wants me to help him.

755
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,650
I have an idea

756
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,460
to realize all of these

757
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,900
within one day.

758
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,690
Tell me.

759
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,020
Let go of your obsession

760
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,330
and become the Immortal.

761
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,340
The Three Realms

762
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,860
will be under your control.

763
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,180
If I want to regain my memory, I need to return to the Immortal Palace.

764
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,420
What about you?

765
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,780
Where would you be?

766
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,890
You always want me to find my past.

767
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,100
But what I want

768
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,740
is you.

769
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,210
I don't want to get through

770
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,140
the tribulation.

771
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,740
If you don't want to face it,

772
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,060
then wait for three more days.

773
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Make your decision

774
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,980
after three days.

775
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
Let alone three days,

776
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,780
even if it's three or thirty years,

777
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
I'll have the same answer.

778
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,740
I don't want to be Immortal Luo Ge.

779
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,620
I just want to be a mortal.

780
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,220
But I don't have that much time left.

781
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,050
Luo Ge.

782
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,780
Three days.

783
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,340
Just three days.

784
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,100
What if I disappear one day

785
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,690
and you can't find me?

786
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,170
Don't you dare.

787
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,580
Try me.

788
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,940
Sorry.

789
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,420
Luo Ge.

790
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,100
If you still can't remember,

791
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,860
let me help you fulfill your responsibilities.

792
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,860
It's just three days

793
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,370
and the talisman pearl couldn't stop it.

794
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,420
Even the formation is weakening.

795
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,140
We don't have the eye of formation.

796
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,420
The eye of formation?

797
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,140
The location of Liu Shao

798
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,300
is the eye of formation.

799
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,620
Although Liu Shao is not powerful,

800
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,540
she has the power of the Sun Spirit.

801
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,380
So she can suppress the formation.

802
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,380
Besides, this formation

803
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,860
was set by Luo Ge.

804
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,220
Even without the eye of formation,

805
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,970
it's more powerful than my formation.

806
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,740
Now the formation has been corroded by evil spirit.

807
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,020
If anything happens to

808
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,740
the person who guards the eye of formation,

809
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,500
the person will be devoured by evil spirit.

810
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,300
I will go.

811
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,140
The Immortal Palace

812
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,940
should be led by you young people.

813
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,140
Immortal Master is highly respected.

814
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,020
You'd better take charge of the situation here.

815
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,180
I've been enjoying the undeserved reputation of the head of the Palaces

816
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,780
for a long time.

817
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,300
I'm your senior.

818
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,100
It's not your turn to be the eye of formation.

819
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,140
Go and see Luo Ge.

820
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,180
This tribulation

821
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,580
is not only about him.

822
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,340
He must get through it.

823
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,100
Okay.

824
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,860
If he can't get through this tribulation,

825
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,020
you must take the sixth talisman pearl back.

826
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,020
But after taking the sixth talisman pearl,

827
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,420
I'm afraid Liu Shao will be...

828
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,770
I'll take the Ancient Herb and Glazed Fruit

829
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,900
to her.

830
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,260
Master Zhuo.

831
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,780
We're counting on you.
