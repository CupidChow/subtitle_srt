[Episode 27]

4
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,940
Everyone in the Immortal Palace thinks they're the best.

5
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,979
They keep saying things about the Immortal and the three worlds.

6
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,660
But they are just all talk.

7
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,780
They can't give up their obsession

8
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,580
just like me.

9
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,539
What a joke.

10
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,780
That's none of your business.

11
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,940
Immortal...

12
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,620
Xiyin Mountain.

13
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,820
Xiyin Mountain is stable.

14
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,060
Did Luo Ge...

15
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,579
Yes.

16
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,420
He did it.

17
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,540
Luo Ge.

18
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,260
Just wait.

19
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,420
We'll meet again.

20
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,340
Ao Yin

21
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,500
will never cause trouble to the mortal world again.

22
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,940
Liu Shao.

23
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,540
Luo Ge is here.

24
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,010
Liu Shao.

25
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,780
But he can't recognize me anymore.

26
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,020
Liu Shao.

27
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,140
Liu Shao.

28
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,860
Luo Ge.

29
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,780
Demon King,

30
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,780
thank you.

31
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,260
If you really want to thank me,

32
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,500
please forgive my brother.

33
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,620
If you want me to forgive him,

34
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,459
ask him to send my sister back first.

35
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,140
Useless!

36
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,850
You can't even stand one attack from Luo Ge!

37
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,300
Luo Ge has become the Immortal again.

38
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,900
Ao Yin is just a demon.

39
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,380
Now,

40
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,540
do you think you can beat him?

41
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,260
Shut up!

42
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,380
Luo Ge

43
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,740
and Lu Li

44
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,380
are just the same as me.

45
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,180
What do you want?

46
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,740
You still own one magic weapon.

47
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,740
The one you took

48
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,250
from the Yin-yang Cave a thousand years ago.

49
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,930
Brother.

50
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,220
Fu.

51
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,700
Judging from the sky,

52
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,260
I think my brother must have succeeded.

53
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,620
The paper boats you released

54
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,820
to pray for him are not in vain.

55
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,300
Thank you, too.

56
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,340
Thank you for accompanying me and comforting me these days.

57
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,210
You took me to many interesting places.

58
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,860
Luo Ge.

59
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,100
Are you awake?

60
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,210
Are you feeling better?

61
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,870
Are you the mortal Luo Ge

62
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,540
or the Immortal Luo Ge?

63
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,980
They are both me.

64
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,020
Is it true?

65
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,380
The Immortal Luo Ge?

66
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,820
Did your magic power really recover?

67
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,380
Liu Shao.

68
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,539
For the past few days in the mortal world,

69
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,010
I wanted to give up all my responsibilities willfully

70
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,100
and make you bear all this for me.

71
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,980
I put you in a difficult position.

72
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,500
Do you remember everything?

73
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,140
No matter how many times of tribulations I've experienced,

74
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,700
I shouldn't have forgotten you.

75
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,740
Since you remember everything,

76
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,180
will the Soul-devouring Spell

77
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,020
attack again?

78
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,820
The Soul-devouring Spell born from love

79
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,500
and the Phoenix Tears that make people forget love

80
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,460
actually oppose each other.

81
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,780
They kept fighting in my body

82
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,530
until

83
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,260
they completely disappeared.

84
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,580
Really?

85
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,900
But what if...

86
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,890
Don't worry.

87
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,570
But if you can't...

88
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,100
I know.

89
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,830
I know what you're worried about.

90
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,220
And I know

91
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,530
you're ready to leave Xiyin Mountain.

92
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,860
There are pros and cons to everything.

93
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
If I set limits for everything,

94
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,820
♫The begonia is red, but every promise makes it more withered♫

95
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,540
what's the use of being the Immortal?

96
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,670
♫It blooms alone, but the wind and rain are more violent♫

97
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:51,250
♫Plants are not human beings, and ruthless fruits are planted♫

98
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,540
Keep this.

99
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,050
Don't throw it away again.

100
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Just like the Soul-devouring Spell

101
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,060
and the Phoenix Tears,

102
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,230
♫How can you forget the innocence and ignorance when we first met?♫

103
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,300
everything in the world is intertwined.

104
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,860
But there will always be a solution.

105
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,580
What I am fighting with is the evil of the three worlds.

106
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,530
♫The butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, but it is difficult to fly to the sky♫

♫The butterfly's wings were broken, and the dream fell without a trace♫

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,420
will be just like today.

172
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,620
We'll be together forever

173
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,050
and never abandon each other.

174
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,420
I

175
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,570
granted.

176
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,050
You promise

177
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
and will never go back on your word?

178
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,250
I promise

179
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,220
and I will never go back on my word.

180
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,620
Now what I want

181
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,460
is in my arms.

182
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,180
For the rest of my life,

183
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,060
I only wish to protect the peace of the three worlds

184
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,540
and the safety of all beings.

185
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,260
Today,

186
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,940
I heard the sorrow and joy of all beings

187
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,420
and understood the righteousness.

188
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,260
I'm here to pray,

189
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,540
from now on,

190
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,060
I'm willing to take the happiness

191
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,410
and the worries of the world as mine.

192
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,900
Suffer with the world

193
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,650
and enjoy the happiness with the world

194
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,580
until the whole world is united

195
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,860
and there is no more sorrow.

196
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,560
♫I want to find our way through destiny♫

197
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,760
♫I want to throw away the memory in exchange for you to come back♫

198
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,250
♫Raise the glass to reincarnate the world♫

199
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,720
♫I'll wait for your response with no regrets♫

200
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,220
Immortal Master,

201
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,500
thousand of stars suddenly appeared.

202
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,490
♫I'll find the promised home for you♫

203
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,820
What does that mean?

204
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,210
If I'm right

205
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,560
♫My heart aches and I will say yes again♫

206
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,260
Luo Ge has seen through his heart

207
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,140
and the rules of the world,

208
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,940
and preliminarily shown signs of becoming a god.

209
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,380
♫When will we separate?♫

210
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,340
Will Luo Ge soon

211
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,100
be promoted to Supreme God?

212
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,380
♫Please don't tell us our ending in advance♫

213
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,860
Welcome Immortal

214
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,500
return from the tribulation.

215
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,540
I fell into the mortal world accidentally.

216
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,740
Sorry for making you concerned.

217
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,180
It's good that you returned safely.

218
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,300
The crisis of the three worlds has been solved.

219
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,700
The only worrying thing

220
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,740
is the Four Seasons Monument.

221
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,550
Don't worry.

222
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,820
I'll make some preparation

223
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,780
to reinforce magic circle

224
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
and stabilize the Four Seasons Monument.

225
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,140
That's good.

226
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,980
Where is Shang Yurong?

227
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,900
-I’m not going. -Come with me.

228
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,420
I'm not going, Senior.

229
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,380
You know what I did.

230
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,380
Luo Ge will skin me.

231
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,940
How dare he!

232
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,380
If he dares to skin you,

233
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,500
I'll tear down the Chonghua Palace.

234
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,660
He may, at most, peel off your trendy clothes.

235
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,740
No way.

236
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,260
What's the difference between skinning me?

237
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,540
Liu Shao is fine now.

238
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,380
You may plead later.

239
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,450
I dare not.

240
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,780
Just tell Luo Ge

241
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,900
I'm in seclusion.

242
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,780
When I succeed,

243
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,650
I will master...

244
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,830
Burning Sea?

245
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,530
Great Sword Formation.

246
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,170
Are you really going to the demon world?

247
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,580
The Four Seasons Monument is too important.

248
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,940
You have to take care of here first.

249
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,020
But can you be relieved

250
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,140
if Luo Ning doesn't come back?

251
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,860
I do worry a lot.

252
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,740
I had no memory back then.

253
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,420
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let Luo Ning

254
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
leave with Fu.

255
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,780
Fu

256
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,800
is too dangerous.

257
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,500
But Fu is also He Na's brother.

258
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,780
There won't be any danger for me to meet He Na.

259
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,010
Fu.

260
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,850
What's wrong?

261
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Your brother has returned to the Immortal Palace.

262
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,500
Are you going back soon?

263
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,550
You said

264
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,420
you want to visit the place where I grew up.

265
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,300
Okay.

266
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,300
How about

267
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,260
tomorrow?

268
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,740
We'll go tomorrow.

269
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,460
And then?

270
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,500
Leave me again and return to the Immortal Palace?

271
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,859
Fu...

272
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,660
What?

273
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,619
Even you dislike me

274
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,500
because I'm an aquatic monster

275
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,460
that will die without water, don't you?

276
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,940
You're not a monster.

277
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,260
Although

278
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,140
you are not a good person,

279
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,140
you're definitely not a monster.

280
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,380
So this is the Demon Palace.

281
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,500
Don't you have walls in your rooms?

282
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
This is my room.

283
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,020
Your room

284
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,250
is only as big as

285
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,460
the palm.

286
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,260
I don't like being controlled

287
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,500
so I usually

288
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,300
stay alone.

289
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,620
Why?

290
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,740
You don't like it?

291
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,620
If you don't like it, I'll change to a bigger one tomorrow.

292
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,020
No need.

293
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,100
I don't like big rooms either.

294
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,620
It's common to feel lonely

295
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,330
if you keep staying alone.

296
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,690
You won't be lonely anymore.

297
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
I'll always be with you.

298
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,700
Look.

299
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
If this crystal cup

300
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,260
is used to serve my dew,

301
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,380
it must be beautiful.

302
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:25,940
Look.

303
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,740
They are in pairs.

304
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,940
Tomorrow,

305
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,660
one for you and one for me.

306
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,220
Let's collect the dew together.

307
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,900
What do you think?

308
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,580
Fu.

309
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,980
Demon King.

310
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,700
Fairy Luo Ning.

311
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,220
Liu Shao's waiting for you outside.

312
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,260
Liu Shao's here?

313
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,820
Liu Shao.

314
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,660
Luo Ning.

315
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,170
-Liu Shao. -Luo Ning.

316
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,700
Fu.

317
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,900
Liu Shao is here for Luo Ning.

318
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:05,810
What?

319
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,740
You think I caused trouble again

320
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,560
since I brought the fairy back.

321
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,620
Cool.

322
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
Tie me up and apologize to the Immortal Palace.

323
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,460
I risked my life to subdue the demon world

324
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,340
for your freedom.

325
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,810
Do you think I'll send you back to the Immortal Palace?

326
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,580
How's your hand?

327
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,690
What happened between you and Fu?

328
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,020
Then

329
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,620
what happened between you and brother?

330
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,220
You're an immortal and he's a demon.

331
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,180
The love between immortals and demons is unacceptable.

332
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,260
But everyone says

333
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,500
you and my brother's spiritual power oppose each other

334
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,540
and can't coexist.

335
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,420
But you still

336
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,180
insist to be together

337
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,900
no matter live

338
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,580
or dead.

339
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,140
Right.

340
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,340
I always think

341
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,780
there is a bond between me and the Brahma tree.

342
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,560
Now it seems that it likes you more.

343
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,540
Why

344
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,700
I feel familiar with this tree?

345
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,300
I feel like

346
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,200
I've seen it before.

347
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,420
And the flowers.

348
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,220
I don't know why

349
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,300
I really want to cry when I see them.

350
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Have you heard of the legend of the Brahma tree?

351
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,980
The tragic ending of the Demon King and Immortal Ze Shui

352
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,930
is not only because of the gap between immortals and demons.

353
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,140
More importantly,

354
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
their love began with deception.

355
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,100
Luo Ning,

356
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,260
your brother doesn't trust Fu.

357
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,180
But if you want to choose him,

358
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,220
why don't you feel

359
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,020
if he is sincere to you.

360
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,020
If he is,

361
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,820
I'll persuade your brother for you.

362
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,570
Sincere...

363
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,020
I think

364
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,860
he is sincere to me.

365
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,500
Luo Ge.

366
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,820
I found Luo Ning.

367
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,140
She wants to play for a few more days.

368
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,500
I want to

369
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,140
stay with her in the Demon Palace for a while.

370
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,260
I'm busy at the Immortal Palace.

371
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,610
I might not be able to take care of you.

372
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,780
You can play for a few more days.

373
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,620
Luo Ge, you're a liar who values love over friendship.

374
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,020
You even tricked me here

375
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,620
to revenge for Liu Shao.

376
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,420
Can you behave like the Immortal?

377
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
You've been torturing me for so long.

378
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,940
What's the matter?

379
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,980
If there's nothing, I'm leaving.

380
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,570
Wait.

381
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
What else do you want to say?

382
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,660
Say it.

383
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,450
I'm actually a little worried about Luo Ning.

384
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,410
The General of Water

385
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,380
disobeyed his brother

386
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,100
to accompany Luo Ning.

387
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,940
I think Luo Ning is quite like him.

388
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,620
Did you overstep it?

389
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,460
You do know

390
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,380
about Immortal Ze Shui's past.

391
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,540
How dare you!

392
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,700
Fu.

393
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,420
What happened?

394
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,140
Leave.

395
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,620
Nothing.

396
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,380
It's just that the crystal cup you like

397
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:11,980
is broken.

398
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,090
But I know which craftsman made it.

399
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,370
I can definitely find

400
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,180
the same one for you.

401
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,820
It's okay.

402
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,860
The fragrance I made

403
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,660
is much more precious than these crystal cups.

404
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,940
I just made it.

405
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,740
Try it for me.

406
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:25,980
Here.

407
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,660
Don't let your brother see this.

408
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,580
So what?

409
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,580
Will my brother forbid me to like girls?

410
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:49,860
Fu.

411
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,580
Come out with me.

412
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,700
Wait for me.

413
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,700
I didn't expect

414
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,660
the tracing fragrance

415
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,370
has come in handy so soon.

416
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,500
And I can know

417
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,900
if Fu did something wrong again

418
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,620
that made Demon King look so bad.

419
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:38,860
Fu.

420
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,620
How are you

421
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,460
and Luo Ning doing?

422
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,260
She's mine now.

423
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,060
You...

424
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,100
Fu.

425
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,780
I will announce

426
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,900
that I'll pass the position of Demon King to you the other day.

427
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,740
And then you'd go to the Immortal Palace to propose marriage.

428
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,980
If brother disagrees,

429
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,020
I'll take Liu Shao away with me

430
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,110
to piss him off.

431
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,220
What did you say?

432
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,220
The Immortal Palace never accepts the marriage with the Demons.

433
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,580
But if you propose as the Demon King

434
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,060
and Luo Ning is willing to marry you,

435
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,660
it may work out.

436
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,220
Brother.

437
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,360
But I don't want your position as the Demon King.

438
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,460
I want to give it to you.

439
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,460
I don't want it.

440
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,100
You worked so hard to get it.

441
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,980
You even lost one hand for it.

442
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,620
I don't want it.

443
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,940
Do you still want to marry Luo Ning?

444
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,140
No.

445
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,260
The Immortal Palace always looks down on us.

446
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Immortal Ze Shui

447
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,340
is the source

448
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,620
of our clan's suffering.

449
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,980
I hate them so much.

450
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,100
And Luo Ning

451
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,260
is important to Luo Ge

452
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,330
and the Immortal Palace.

453
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,540
She's also the inheritor of Immortal Ze Shui.

454
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,500
So,

455
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,100
she's the perfect choice to take revenge on.

456
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,140
Fu,

457
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,260
Fairy Luo Ning is sincere to you.

458
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,580
How can you treat her like this?

459
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,580
It's her choice to throw herself at me.

460
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,260
Do you want me to

461
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,170
lose the girl who threw herself at me like you?

462
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,860
You...

463
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,460
If you really think so,

464
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,900
I can only ask Liu Shao

465
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,420
to take Luo Ning back to Immortal Palace now.

466
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,340
She won't leave.

467
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,660
Besides,

468
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,540
as long as I treat her well,

469
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,420
she will depend more on me.

470
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,260
You're afraid.

471
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,860
You're afraid she'll leave.

472
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,140
Luo Ning?

473
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,780
What's wrong?

474
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,740
Nothing.

475
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,620
I just recalled

476
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,260
what you said before.

477
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,860
Liu Shao.

478
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,620
Tell me.

479
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,460
If

480
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,850
there are many lies in love,

481
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,100
is that still love?

482
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,450
Did Fu lie to you?

483
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,820
No.

484
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,860
If he dares to lie to me,

485
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,220
I won't let him off easily.

486
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,260
Help me!

487
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,460
Help me!

488
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Help me out!

489
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,540
Help me out!

490
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,660
Immortal Master.

491
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,420
Ge.

492
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,380
You are still here

493
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,760
even it's late.

494
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,540
Maybe

495
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,900
it's because I'm old.

496
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,100
Since you returned from the mortal world,

497
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,460
I've been worried about the Four Seasons Monument.

498
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,390
So,

499
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,020
I come here often.

500
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,720
Why did you

501
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,340
come here?

502
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,420
I just felt

503
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,020
there's an abnormal wave near the Four Seasons Monument.

504
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,300
I was worried

505
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,860
so I came to have a look.

506
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,420
The Protection Spell

507
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,260
of Immortal Palace is solid

508
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,180
and you are guarding here.

509
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,900
I think

510
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,820
everything will be fine.

511
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,620
But the Four Seasons Monument is still unstable.

512
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,250
I'm still worried.

513
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,740
As for this,

514
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,090
the major reason

515
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,220
may be that Liu Shao's spiritual power

516
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,660
opposes yours.

517
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,060
Don't worry about it.

518
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,420
I know what to do.

519
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,620
That's good.

520
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:08,940
Let's go.

521
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,780
You've been worried

522
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,940
since you came here.

523
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,620
My spiritual power opposes Luo Ge's.

524
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,820
As long as this problem is not solved,

525
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,700
I won't be able to rest assured.

526
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:44,940
Here.

527
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,140
This is...

528
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,700
The Six-star Brilliant Array.

529
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,220
It can seal

530
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,940
your Sun Spirit

531
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,040
[Six-star Brilliant Array]

532
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,860
so that you and Luo Ge won't oppose each other anymore.

533
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,610
But this formation

534
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,860
is very dangerous.

535
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,650
It may damage the meridians

536
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,620
and kill the person on the spot.

537
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,540
You must be careful.

538
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,900
There really is such a formation.

539
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,980
It was created by the Demon King ten thousand years ago

540
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,260
to keep Immortal Ze Shui.

541
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,260
It's very harmful to the sealed person.

542
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,500
In order to keep Immortal Ze Shui,

543
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,140
the Demon King even risked her life.

544
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,140
The Demon King dared to seal Immortal Ze Shui

545
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,940
because he got a magic weapon

546
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,130
that could prevent Immortal Ze Shui's meridians

547
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,580
from being damaged.

548
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,580
What is it?

549
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,100
Tears of the Half-Demon.

550
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,420
It's Bai Feng's scent.

551
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,820
She is still alive?

552
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,060
Why?

553
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,060
Why I can't see anything?

554
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,500
Who's there?

555
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,300
Who?

556
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,300
Who?

557
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,820
Fu.

558
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,820
You saved me.

559
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,940
What's wrong with me?

560
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,900
Why I can't see anthing?

561
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,980
Don't you remember?

562
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,260
Your eyes were hurt by

563
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,380
by Zhuo Qiuxian's Thunder Whip.

564
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,900
You are blind.

565
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,540
It was all your fault.

566
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,280
It was all because you instigated me.

567
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,580
It was all your fault.

568
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,460
It was all your fault.

569
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,220
I instigated you?

570
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,200
That was your true intention.

571
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,750
But the one who really hurt you

572
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,100
and pushed you off the cliff

573
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,820
was Liu Shao.

574
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,210
If I hadn't saved you,

575
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,940
you would have been executed by the Immortal Palace.

576
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,070
They will not expect that

577
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,260
I sealed you

578
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,659
and hid you in front of them.

579
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,570
Save me?

580
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,900
You are afraid that I'll be caught by them

581
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,620
and reveal what you've done, aren't you?

582
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,520
Well.

583
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,030
You are not that stupid.

584
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,389
Fu,

585
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,610
it turned out that you've been lying to me.

586
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,920
I like dealing with smart people.

587
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,100
So I can

588
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,490
cure your eyes.

589
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,920
But you have to prove to me that

590
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:05,930
keeping you

591
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,190
is useful to me.

592
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,160
How can I prove it?

593
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,820
Luo Ge and Liu Shao

594
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,760
are now together openly.

595
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,580
Do you hate them?

596
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,970
If the hatred

597
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,570
is unforgettable,

598
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,330
then you are useful to me.

599
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,440
This is the medicine made by Mr. Tai, a skilled doctor of our clan.

600
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,040
If you keep using it for ten days,

601
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,800
your eyes will get better.

602
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,810
I'll come to you then.

603
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,990
So

604
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,380
you've been using me.

605
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,150
You said you will take care of me

606
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,790
and care about me.

607
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Are all those words fake?

608
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,200
Or...

609
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,270
that’s part of your plan.

610
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,040
Bai Feng,

611
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,770
although you have done many evil things,

612
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,500
I don't want to stain my hands.

613
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:00,670
Medicine!

614
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,510
My medicine!

615
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,350
Give it back!

616
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,690
Give it back!

617
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,000
Who?

618
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,380
Who is there?

619
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,650
Give it back!

620
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,160
My medicine!

621
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,690
Who?

622
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,630
You deserve this.

623
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,430
Take care.

624
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,770
The seal of the Four Seasons Monument still exists.

625
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,630
How did he activate my Soul-devouring Spell?

626
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,220
How did he release the son of the Demon King?

627
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,290
Something is fishy.

628
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,760
This is...

629
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,530
Luo Ge.

630
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,430
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

631
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,360
You're so relaxed.

632
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,500
But I'm curious

633
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,070
how did you escape from the Four Seasons Monument.

634
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,460
I was born from obsession.

635
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,140
I can go wherever I want.

636
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,360
There's no need to escape.

637
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:00,790
No.

638
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,600
It's impossible for ordinary evil spirit to be that powerful.

639
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,440
Yes.

640
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,780
Good.

641
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,680
Think hard here.

642
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,220
You'll eventually become another me anyway.

643
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,880
If this continues,

644
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,050
something might happen.

645
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,360
Looks like I need to find a way

646
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,090
to repair the Four Seasons Monument soon as possible.

647
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,010
Brahma tree,

648
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,570
is this the feeling of being deceived

649
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,870
and betrayed

650
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,890
by the one I love?

651
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,160
It is

652
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,500
painful.

653
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,570
Ten thousand years ago,

654
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,930
did Immortal Ze Shui feel the same as me?

655
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,440
Luo Ning.

656
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,110
Luo Ning.

657
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,870
Look.

658
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,090
I found a whole set of crystal cups and crystal pots.

659
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,160
You can store as much dew as you want.

660
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:54,750
No need.

661
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,440
You don't like it?

662
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,240
Yes.

663
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,840
I don't like it.

664
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,220
So, no need.

665
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:04,830
Luo Ning.

666
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,070
What's wrong?

667
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,130
Nothing.

668
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,480
I just told Liu Shao

669
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,160
that

670
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,680
I'll go back to the Immortal Palace with her today.

671
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,230
What did you say?

672
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,680
You said you'd stay a few more days.

673
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,450
But I don't want to stay anymore.

674
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,320
Did Liu Shao tell you something?

675
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,830
No.

676
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,190
I suddenly figured it out.

677
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,590
Maybe

678
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,820
immortals and demons

679
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,500
shouldn't be together.

680
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,690
The tragedy of Demon King and Immortal Ze Shui

681
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,290
is our best lesson.

682
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,730
Now that

683
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,490
you have regained your freedom,

684
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,470
you should stay in the Demon Palace

685
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,360
as the General of Water.

686
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,250
I'm going back to the Immortal Palace

687
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,470
as Fairy Luo Ning.

688
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,320
From now on,

689
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,040
we'll live our own lives

690
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,260
and never meet again.

691
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,900
Isn't that better?
