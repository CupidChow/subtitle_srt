4
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,500
Have you ever thought

5
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,500
maybe

6
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:49,979
there is another way to break the curse

7
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,539
other than to cleave the Four Seasons Monument?

8
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,300
Yes, there is

9
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,100
in the legend.

10
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,580
But we tried it before.

11
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,940
It didn't work at all,

12
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,020
did it?

13
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,020
That's because

14
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,260
I only inherited the immortal energy of Immortal Ze Shui.

15
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,380
I didn't inherit her resentment.

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,100
No matter how I try to forgive,

17
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,740
I just can't do it.

18
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,980
But just now,

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,300
the memory of the Brahma tree has told me

20
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,020
as long as the inheritor

21
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
becomes the Demon Queen,

22
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,460
she will have the right to forgive the Demons

23
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,340
and break the curse for ten thousand years.

24
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,620
Do you remember

25
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,090
that time

26
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,540
I tried to break the curse?

27
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,980
Demon King,

28
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,610
I'm afraid...

29
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,500
I can't break the curse.

30
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,010
Maybe

31
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,580
someone thinks

32
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,740
I'm not qualified.

33
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,620
But if

34
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,940
I become the Demon Queen,

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,140
what I carry

36
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,040
♫The begonia is red, but every promise makes it more withered♫

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,980
is the hope of the whole Demons.

38
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,890
♫It blooms alone, but the wind and rain are more violent♫

39

♫Plants are not human beings, and ruthless fruits are planted♫

41
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,860
you're willing to marry me and become the Demon Queen?

42
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,340
But

43
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,980
you and Fu have sacrificed too much.

44
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,450
♫How can you forget the innocence and ignorance when we first met?♫

45
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,940
As long as that lunatic who is locked up

46
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,180
would be able to

47
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,750
♫The butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, but it is difficult to fly to the sky♫

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,100
and those people who would die without water

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,440
♫The butterfly's wings were broken, and the dream fell without a trace♫

51

52
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,790
♫Because of their greed for the warmth of fire, they lost each other♫

53
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,260
Have you ever

54
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,100
thought about Fu's feelings?

55
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,700
He has committed so many sins.

56

♫There is a period of youth, and he is waiting for the spring breeze in the coming year♫

Has he ever thought about my feelings?

58
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,740
After I become the Demon Queen

59
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,540
and break the curse,

60
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,540

♫I exiled my thousand-year-old body♫

80
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,180
I recalled

81

what she heard when she hid her breath.

82
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140

♫The butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, but it is difficult to fly to the sky♫

All right, that's not important.

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,740
Well,

148
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,900
if the person who saved me

149
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,210
is talented and kind,

150
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,500
can I marry him?

151
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,210
Luo Ning,

152
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,260
I just want you to find

153
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,210
a kind and decent man.

154
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,500
As long as he's not a demon,

155
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,820
I will ask no more.

156
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,460
It looks like

157
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,250
Luo Ning is determined to marry the Demon King.

158
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,980
But I really don't know

159

160
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,530
That day,

161
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,340
I knew that Wan Sui would go to the Demon Palace.

162
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,900
So I asked you

163
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,860
to show up in front of him.

164
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,220
Bai Feng.

165
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,900
Wan Sui would definitely

166
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,340
-spread it. -They are totally different.

167
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,580
How could they be brothers?

168
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,820
Master.

169
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:16,940
Who?

170
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,500
Then I told

171
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,300
Luo Ning

172
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,180
about the Demon King and Immortal Ze Shui.

173
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,100
I watched her grow up

174
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,820
and I know her best.

175
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,460
She will definitely investigate it herself.

176
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,180
In this way,

177
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,820
Fu

178
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,700
will be punished by He Na.

179
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,460
If you do this,

180
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,140
how will he help you?

181
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,220
He is locked up by He Na.

182
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,100
Fu is arrogant

183
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
and difficult to control.

184
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,370
But I need someone

185
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,380
who can help me cleave the Four Seasons Monument.

186
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,620
He has the bloodline of the Demon King

187
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,060
and he is the best candidate.

188
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,380
Before that,

189
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,460
I must

190
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,540
curb his temper.

191
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,860
Go to the Demon Palace and keep an eye on him

192
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,140
and find out his movements.

193
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,420
Then

194
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,580
come back and report to me.

195
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,140
Yes.

196
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,460
Fu,

197
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,420
I'm not afraid you won't listen to me.

198
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
In the past few months,

199
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,980
the Four Seasons Monument has been in trouble too frequently.

200
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,740
Could it be the spy hiding in Immortal Palace

201
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,580
doing something bad?

202
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,300
This time,

203
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I ask you here

204
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,660
to tell you something.

205
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,940
Please go ahead.

206
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,460
Xie Lingqi hid Wu Shiwei's immortal energy

207
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,620
in the Bone Melting Pool.

208
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,940
Besides, Wu Shiwei has been trapped in Yin-yang Cave

209
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,090
for a thousand years.

210
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,940
She is like a walking dead.

211
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,260
We must investigate her immortal energy.

212
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,740
Xie Lingqi resists

213
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,100
the inspection and purification.

214
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,740
Isn't that suspicious?

215
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,330
I think

216
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,650
Xie Lingqi

217
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,230
is probably still doing evil deeds for the evil.

218
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,660
He is the spy.

219
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,190
It’s easy to prove his innocence.

220
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,120
General Xie,

221
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,560
all you need to do is to hand over Wu Shiwei's immortal energy.

222
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,790
Hand it over?

223
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,300
Why?

224
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,950
That immortal energy

225
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,430
is the only thing Shiwei left.

226
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,860
You are asking me to hand it over?

227
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,500
Why don't you kill me?

228
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,850
I believe Xie Lingqi is innocent.

229
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,090
The Four Seasons Monument has been in trouble several times.

230
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
It might be the evil spirit

231
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,250
in the immortal energy.

232
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,130
But

233
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,030
do you have any solid evidence?

234
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,380
Ge,

235
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,850
a leopard can't change

236
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,530
its spots.

237
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
Don't be indecisive.

238
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,190
Xie Lingqi can't do

239
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,120
this damage.

240
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,000
Immortal Master,

241
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,270
I've checked

242
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,650
the damage to the Four Seasons Monument.

243
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,130
It has nothing to do with him.

244
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,310
General Xie is innocent.

245
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,310
The evil is very cunning.

246
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,590
He makes us suspect each other and makes people panic.

247
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,360
That's what he wants to see.

248
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,590
Don't panic.

249
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,510
Yes.

250
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,480
Shiwei,

251
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,340
I will become the senior

252
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,310
in your heart,

253
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,530
right?

254
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,360
I know you didn't do it.

255
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,640
But I need you to pretend to be imprisoned

256
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,110
to help me find

257
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,550
the spy hiding the Immortal Palace.

258
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,760
I will protect the Immortal Palace.

259
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,950
Immortal,

260
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,300
someone has been coming in and going out the Xiyin Mountain recently.

261
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,680
Maybe the spy

262
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,820
is taking action again.

263
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,390
The situation is getting more dangerous.

264
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,030
Liu Shao,

265
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,870
every progress you make

266
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,060
is our chip to succeed.

267
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,400
What do you think?

268
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,830
Am I good?

269
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,720
Not bad.

270
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,700
What do you mean by that? Praise me.

271
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,720
You've improved a lot.

272
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,880
Last time I saw Luo Ning,

273
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,150
she seemed to have something on her mind.

274
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,220
Do you need me to see her?

275
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,280
Okay.

276
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,080
Your brother said you have something on your mind.

277
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,170
I came to see you.

278
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,250
Nothing.

279
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,270
Really?

280
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,800
Liu Shao.

281
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,690
Do you know?

282
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,460
I saw it with my own eyes in the Demon Palace that

283
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,690
the people of the Aquatic Demons

284
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,250
died in front of me.

285
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,980
It was so miserable.

286
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,080
I don't want to see

287
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,400
it happens again.

288
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,510
I can end all of this.

289
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,900
I'm the inheritor to the Immortal Ze Shui's immortal energy.

290
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,040
I can break this curse.

291
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,730
So,

292
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,710
I want to marry He Na.

293
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,170
Luo Ning.

294
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,390
Luo Ning.

295
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,010
When did you know

296
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,360
you're the inheritor of Immortal Ze Shui?

297
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,760
The moment I found out that

298
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,120
I can summon

299
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,930
and activate Bone-Corroding Harp.

300
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,960
Since young,

301
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,560
you asked me to copy scriptures

302
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,630
and forbid me to touch anything related to the demonic world.

303
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,560
I guess

304
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,160
that's the reason.

305
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,310
Since you know it,

306
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,040
you should know

307
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,520
what happened between the Demon King and Ze Shui ten thousand years ago.

308
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,120
I will never agree to

309
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,100
this marriage.

310
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,760
But this marriage is not a loss to me.

311
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,820
Brother,

312
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,390
you are the only one who loves me.

313
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,360
But it's different now.

314
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,250
Now there's He Na.

315
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,600
He won't interfere with my life.

316
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,040
My life

317
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,220
will be more free

318
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,270
and more noble.

319
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,790
Isn't that good?

320
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,220
Luo Ning,

321
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,620
the curse of the Aquatic Demons has nothing to do with you.

322
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,180
The Three Realms shouldn't be your responsibility.

323
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,990
You should find someone you love

324
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,590
to spend your life together.

325
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,300
I can't.

326
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,190
What did you say?

327
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,380
I said

328
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,650
I can't find him.

329
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,099
The person I used to like

330
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,460
has been kicked to hell by me.

331
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,450
I even closed

332
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,920
his coffin tightly.

333
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,770
He will never come out again.

334
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,450
I will never

335
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,590
let him hurt

336
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,690
the people I love the most.

337
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,370
You mean...

338
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,720
Fu?

339
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,740
Did Fu do something to you?

340
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,300
Brother, stop mentioning him.

341
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,160
I just want you to know that

342
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,600
I will become the Demon Queen

343
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,490
and break the curse for the Aquatic Demons.

344
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,480
I promise

345
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,580
I will live a happy life.

346
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,020
Please help me.

347
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,110
No.

348
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,320
I can't let you sacrifice your life happiness

349
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,540
for a curse.

350
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,550
So what?

351
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,740
If you don't agree,

352
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,870
I'll marry him anyway.

353
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,060
If you lock me up,

354
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,070
I'll divest Ze Shui's immortal energy

355
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,880
and drown myself in this pond.

356
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,260
You...

357
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,530
Immortal Luo Ge.

358
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,170
Immortal Master Wanwu said something happened to the Four Seasons Monument.

359
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,260
Please go over.

360
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:46,220
♫The remaining flowers in the mirror reflect the moon in the water♫

361
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,140
♫We can't live up to such a good time♫

362

♫Recalling the unforgettable glance at the beginning♫

363
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,830
Luo Ning,

364
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,740
are you really going to sacrifice your life

365
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,740
♫I realized that it was a thousand years ago♫

366
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,870
for a curse?

367
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,800
♫Is this bad luck, or good luck?♫

368
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,210
This curse of thousands of years

369
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,420
♫He said that responsibility and love are difficult to balance♫

370
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,570
has driven so many people crazy.

371
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,250
♫He had no choice but to leave me♫

372

♫The past has passed, so do not linger♫

374
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,960
one of them.

375
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,200
♫My love for you is still so strong♫

376
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,520
♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

377
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,080

♫Who would like to take a broken willow branch and watch the moon alone in the blue sky♫

379
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,890
♫Life is like a grain of sand♫

380
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,320
♫It burns the fire in my heart♫

381
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:51,340
♫I want to burn myself to hear you say you have never changed♫

382
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,990
In this world

383
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,050
everything

384
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,190
have to choose their own fate.

385
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,710
I thought

386
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,070
I was a carefree fairy in the Xiyin Mountain.

387
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,380
I don't need to think about anything.

388
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,310
But in the end,

389
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,320
we have to move forward

390
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,630
and make our own choices.

391
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,350
♫Why have you been so far away from me every time♫

392
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,200
I hope everything I do

00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,480
♫For billions of years♫

394
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,020

♫Can I use your hands to warm up the world again?♫

396
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,130

♫A few hasty nights♫

398
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,190

400

♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

401
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,470
is not the one who made you laugh

402
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,940
and played with you?

403
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,030
I am

404
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,980
♫Have shattered my dreams♫

405

♫Who would like to take a broken willow branch and watch the moon alone in the blue sky♫

407
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,990
Since this is caused by Ze Shui,

408
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,230
let me end it.

409
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,810
Your Majesty,

410
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,870
could the curse of the Demons

411
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,510
be broken this time?

412
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,790
Yes.

413
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm going to the Immortal Palace.

414
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,550
Will Immortal Luo Ge

415
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,490
agree?

416
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,520
Whether he agrees or not,

417
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,420
I have to

418
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,610
discuss it with him in advance.

419
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,340
And I have to say goodbye

420
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,880
to Liu Shao.

421
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,090
Miss Liu Shao.

422
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,430
My name is Kho.

423
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,650
It's your demon.

424
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,210
My demon?

425
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,340
Kho?

426
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Don't hit my demon!

427
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
This is my demon.

428
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,400
How can I hand him over?

429
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,950
No.

430
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,420
Your demon?

431
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,060
You're so beautiful and kind.

432
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,700
You don't talk much

433
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,790
every time you lie.

434
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,940
And you will tilt your head to the left like this.

435
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,420
People could see you through at a glance.

436
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,600
If you don't fight for

437
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,620
some things,

438
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,550
you will never get it.

439
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,730
From now on,

440
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,150
I will try my best

441
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,340
to get what I want

442
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,770
no matter it's for the survival of my people

443
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,770
or the people I care about.

444
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,800
You mean Fu?

445
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,800
And you.

446
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,770
My Demon Palace still lacks a Demon Queen.

447
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,780
He Na...

448
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,040
I...

449
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,690
Just kidding.

450
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,120
Anyway, remember

451
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,590
you are not alone.

452
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,390
At least in the Demon Palace,

453
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,760
I will be by your side.

454
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,700
From now on,

455
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,970
I'm no longer

456
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,860
your demon.

457
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,150
Fairy Luo Ning,

458
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,300
I will go to Palace Chonghua

459
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,360
to propose the marriage to your brother.

460
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,750
You are quite decisive

461
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:58,970
this time.

462
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,570
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,550
This is only about the Aquatic Demons,

464
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,770
but it involves your life happiness.

465
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,080
It's unfair

466
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,490
and even despicable to you.

467
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,160
The curse of the Aquatic Demons

468
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,720
was originally caused by Immortal Ze Shui.

469
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,360
Since

470
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,040
I inherited the immortal energy of Immortal Ze Shui,

471
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:28,960
I should

472
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,470
end it.

473
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,540
Besides,

474
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,470
the Aquatic Demons

475
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,940
have been punished for ten thousand years.

476
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,710
I shouldn't let this hatred continue.

477
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,850
You and Fu

478
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,290
should have a different life.

479
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,250
Fu.

480
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,080
Fu is too obsessed with hatred.

481
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,390
He deserved it.

482
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,450
And as his brother,

483
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,350
I didn't take good care of him.

484
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,460
He treats you...

485
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,230
Since I've decided to let go,

486
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,570
I won't regret it.

487
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,720
All my decisions

488
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,110
have nothing to do with him.

489
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,260
This marriage is

490
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:18,770
just to break the curse.

491
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,450
I am the Demon King.

492
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,290
It's my duty.

493
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,100
But you were the happiest fairy in the Xiyin Mountain.

494
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,670
After the curse is broken,

495
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,030
it will just be the title

496
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,450
of Demon Queen.

497
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,590
I can still be

498
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,020
the happiest fairy.

499
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,070
Besides, I think

500
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,350
you won't stop me from going anywhere freely.

501
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,480
Demon Palace and Immortal Palace.

502
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,080
You can go anywhere you want.

503
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,600
No matter where you go,

504
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,950
whether you want to

505
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,250
keep the title of Demon Queen,

506
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,190
in the heart of me and the Aquatic Demons,

507
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,010
Fairy Luo Ning

508
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,650
will be always the most respectable person.

509
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,970
We will never

510
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,030
forget it.

511
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,620
Luo Ning wants to marry you.

512
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,000
Is that true?

513
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,320
You know it?

514
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,750
Luo Ning

515
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,350
told me.

516
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,610
Are you blaming me for being selfish and having an ulterior motive

517
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,380
to marry Luo Ning?

518
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,200
I know you've been thinking about your people

519
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,930
and your responsibility as the Demon King.

520
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,660
But...

521
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,880
It's the Demon King's responsibility,

522
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,530
not He Na's.

523
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,690
He Na is a boy in white who can't lie.

524
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,930
He would do anything

525
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,080
for his friends.

526
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,100
What about him?

527
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,450
I once thought

528
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,630
to follow my heart.

529
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,660
But seeing the girl I like

530
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,800
having a better future,

531
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,110
I feel relieved.

532
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,220
I can't just think about the girl I like.

533
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,190
Now,

534
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,470
I can only be the Demon King.

535
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,790
Since I've taken the honor of the Demon King,

536
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,730
I'm destined to take the responsibility of the Demon King.

537
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,340
There are

538
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,190
countless people behind me

539
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,710
who have been longing for sunlight and land.

540
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,980
There are thousands of people who yearn for a happy family

541
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,580
like me.

542
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,960
If I can exchange thousands of people's happiness

543
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,480
with my unhappy marriage,

544
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,300
I think it's worth it.

545
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:32,970
He Na.

546
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,860
Liu Shao.

547
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,660
Thank you.

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,130
Wow.

569
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,850
Demon King spent a lot.

570
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,690
Of course.

571
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,240
Otherwise, how can he marry our fairy?

572
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,880
What do you think is inside?

573
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,850
It must be something you've never seen.

574
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,900
Take back what you brought.

575
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,000
Or we'll not be friends.

576
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,700
Luo Ge,

577
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,890
I sincerely want to marry Luo Ning.

578
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,940
The person you care about is not Luo Ning.

579
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,280
Maybe not now.

580
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,840
But in the future,

581
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,270
the person I care about

582
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,450
is Luo Ning.

583
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,000
Luo Ge,

584
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,820
please believe me.

585
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,990
I will protect her

586
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,380
and treat her as my life.

587
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,850
I will try my best to make her happy for the rest of her life.

588
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,700
Her happiness

589
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,760
is to spend her life

590
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,770
with her beloved one.

591
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,840
There shouldn't be any schemes.

592
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,660
He Na,

593
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,440
I always respect you for being a gentleman in the demons.

594
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,290
But what you are doing now is not gentlemanly.

595
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,160
You think I'm scheming against her?

596
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,540
Am I wrong?

597
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,780
Luo Ning is a kind girl.

598
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,180
She has been trying to break the curse of your people.

599
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,190
I don't care about that.

600
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,500
I don't even mind helping you out.

601
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,200
But this is not the reason to sacrifice my sister's life happiness.

602
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,260
If there is any other possibility,

603
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,250
I would rather fill myself in

604
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,260
to block the curse

605
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,290
and don't want to implicate others.

606
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,340
Then fill yourself in.

607
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,860
Don't implicate my sister.

608
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,400
He Na.

609
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,170
I don't mind you counting me in

610
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,650
when you fill yourself in.

611
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,700
But please let my sister go.

612
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,560
Luo Ge,

613
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,540
why don't you ask Luo Ning

614
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,980
about her thoughts?

615
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,670
You've been strict with Luo Ning

616
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,070
because you're worried that she'll follow Immortal Ze Shui's path.

617
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,750
It's all my fault.

618
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,640
If I could protect her better,

619
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,790
I might be able to avoid her

620
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,020
getting on this path.

621
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,510
This wouldn't have happened.

622
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,290
Actually, I've talked to He Na.

623
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,480
He's totally different from Fu.

624
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,330
He won't be impulsive and cruel

625
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,360
just like the Demon King ten thousand years ago.

626
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,890
I think he can take good care of Luo Ning.

627
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,080
Don't worry too much about that.

628
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,070
I know He Na's character too.

629
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,520
I just hope

630
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,920
she can be happy forever.

631
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,190
Luo Ge,

632
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,590
are you really not going to attend Luo Ning's wedding?

633
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,520
That's the Demon King in White,

634
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,900
not the Demon King.

635
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,580
What if

636
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,010
Luo Ning cries?

637
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,400
What will she do?

638
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,929
It's the most important day for Luo Ning

639
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,020
and she can't see her brother.

640
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,750
Poor thing.

641
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,350
Just copy the Meditation Spell.

642
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,250
Don't do anything evil.

643
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,980
Do good deeds.

644
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,170
Get rid of all evil ideas

645
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,610
and eliminate the sins.

646
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,440
Didn't you just promise me

647
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,590
to kill those who hurt me?

648
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,780
Now,

649
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,830
it's just a hundred years of imprisonment.

650
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Even if I was wrong,

651
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,640
even if I failed you,

652
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,830
are you really so cruel?

653
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:55,810
A hundred years.

654
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,510
Can you bear not to see me for a hundred years?

655
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,750
Luo Ge,

656
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,340
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,510
You can be sorry to me,

658
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,540
but you can't let Luo Ning down.

659
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,590
My only wish

660
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,660
is the peace of the Three Realms

661
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,810
and the happiness of the people

662
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,880
even if I have to sacrifice my life.

663
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,910
But I never thought

664
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,510
my sister would do the same one day.

665
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,870
I just want her to be happy

666
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,730
in this life.

667
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,870
Okay.

668
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,960
I can't wait.

669
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,510
The Demon Palace and Immortal Palace

670
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,530
are all under my control.

671
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,130
Soon,

672
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,200
I'll be the master of the Three Realms.

673
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:44,600
[Happiness]

674
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,700
Mr. Tai,

675
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,590
how is Fu these days?

676
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,790
General Fu

677
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,340
has been quiet lately.

678
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,320
He made a mistake

679
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,250
and he should be punished.

680
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,280
It's a good thing

681
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,250
for him to cultivate himself.

682
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,180
But I feel guilty

683
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,920
for marrying Luo Ning.

684
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,560
You did it

685
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,000
for the Aquatic Demons.

686
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,470
I'll explain to him

687
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,570
after the curse is broken.

688
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,090
I hope our people

689
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,650
will get rid of the fate of living in the water

690
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,130
and use our race name again.

691
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,970
Melody race.

692
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,860
I hope you can

693
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,340
lead us to land

694
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,490
and revive the Melody race.

695
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:13,470
Luo Ning,

696
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,570
I did as you said.

697
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,140
I copied scriptures.

698
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,160
I copied many scriptures.

699
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,560
Can you stop being angry?

700
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,200
Mr. Tai.

701
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,090
General Fu.

702
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,140
Where is my brother?

703
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,670
His Majesty is busy,

704
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,230
so he sent me here

705
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,910
to see if you need anything.

706
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,750
Yes.

707
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,480
I want to see Luo Ning.

708
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,210
I can't decide on that.

709
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,560
You can show the scriptures

710
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,610
to her.

711
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,160
She will see me.

712
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,090
I will report it

713
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,030
to His Majesty.

714
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,040
Do you have to tell him about such a small matter?

715
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,180
Do you know

716
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,240
I may actually lose her?

717
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,920
I can feel

718
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,690
she's going to give me up.

719
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,840
What?

720
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,400
You don't want to?

721
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,830
What happened?

722
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,080
If there's nothing else, General Fu,

723
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,810
I'll leave now.

724
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,330
Is my brother really going to give me up

725
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,560
and imprison me here for a hundred years?

726
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,730
General Fu,

727
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,840
His Majesty really loves you.

728
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,390
Mr. Tai,

729
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,590
I can't stay here for a hundred years.

730
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,140
No way!
