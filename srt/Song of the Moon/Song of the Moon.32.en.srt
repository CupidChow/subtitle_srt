[Episode 32]

4
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,820
Tree Fairy.

5
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,660
You always thought

6
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,860
that he and I were really in love.

7
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,460
But what about now?

8
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,140
Is this the ending of

9
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,770
true love?

10
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,100
What is the difference

11
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,220
between his actions and those of the animals?

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,180
Is it really because immortals are different from demons?

13
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,220
It turned out

14
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,940
those what the Masters said

15
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,540
were correct.

16
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,060
I knew

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,740
that you simply looked down on demons

18
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,460
in your heart.

19
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,180
I'm a demon, so what?

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,220
In the Three Realms,

21
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
except your brother and God of the Sun,

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,940
everyone surrenders to me.

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,700
Those so called Masters...

24
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,340
Saying that immortals are different from demons...

25
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,380
When I attack Immortal Palace

26
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,100
and they all kneel in front of me,

27
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,020
you will know

28
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,410
that

29
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,579
I'm much more honorable than they are.

30
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,930
Demon King.

31
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,130
Whether you pretended to be a lake demon to deceive me,

32
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,940
or conquered the Three Realms to prove yourself,

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,660
you were wrong.

34
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,300
People like you

35
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,220
don't know the difference between honorable and humble.

36
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,460
Let me tell you,

37
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,460
those who care about the common people are honorable,

38
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,900
and those who kill innocent people are humble.

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,540
I, Ze Shui,

40
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,620
am ashamed to have married such a despicable person as you.

41
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,060
Say it again!

42
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,980
All right!

43
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,020
I am ashamed

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,500
to have married such a despicable person as you.

45
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,579
May you

46
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,060
never see me again

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,460
forever.

48
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,220
Ze Shui!

49
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,180
Ze Shui!

50
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,340
How dare you treat me like this?

51
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,340
How could you do this to me?

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,420
Do you know

53
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,380
that I pretended to be a lake demon to deceive you,

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,250
and conquered the Three Realms to prove myself

55
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,340
just to prove that you did not marry the wrong person?

56
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,500
Even if I am a demon,

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,740
I am still your husband,

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,650
and the best!

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,770
Supreme Gods

60
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,260
and Immortals

61
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,620
are no match for me.

62
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,500
None of them deserve to compare with me!

63
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,980
So

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,620
Immortal Ze Shui

65
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,090
committed suicide afterwards?

66
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,140
Yes.

67
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,820
At that time,

68
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,900
two Supreme Gods were in retreat.

69
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,580
God of the Moonlight sensed her danger

70
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,860
and immediately went over.

71
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,820
But...

72
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,020
he was still late.

73
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,540
Therefore, the curse he set was extremely powerful.

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,820
The people of Aquatic Demons have tried their best,

75
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,700
but they couldn't break it.

76
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,659
But none of this has anything to do with you.

77
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,490
The reason I am telling you this today

78
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,060
is to let you know

79
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,180
that demons are evil.

80
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,540
I know

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,980
that Fu has helped you in the human world,

82
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,940
but as the general of the Demons,

83
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,340
he is cruel by nature.

84
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,900
Luo Ning,

85
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,500
I know you want to repay him,

86
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,340
and it's rare that he's willing to listen to you.

87
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,140
If one day

88
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,140
he ever wants to do bad things again,

89
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,260
you have to persuade him.

90
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,220
For Fu,

91
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,300
you are the only one who can lead him to kindness.

92
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,740
Master,

93
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,250
don't you have ten thousand years of immortal power?

94
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,300
Can't you

95
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,740
make this pill

96
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,860
smaller?

97
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,700
It's not my fault.

98
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,260
There is one ingredient missing in it.

99
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,260
The Star Stone sent by He Na

100
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,660
was very difficult to melt.

101
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,140
It's not easy that I can make this pill.

102
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,210
He Na is such a nice guy.

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,660
Star Stones are so rare,

104
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,940
but he sent it generously.

105
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,380
Yes.

106
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,980
We'd better repay him as soon as possible.

107
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,700
He didn't ask you to repay him.

108
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,140
You're right.

109
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,660
He Na

110
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,420
is really nice.

111
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,260
He's just troublesome occasionally.

112
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,140
If he didn't give you the Six-star Brilliant Array,

113
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,820
you wouldn't need Master to help you replenish your body.

114
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,300
Wait, what are you doing here?

115
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,420
I can't let Immortal know.

116
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,980
He would

117
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,140
have killed me

118
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,020
if he knew

119
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,620
I delivered medicine to He Na.

120
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
He Na lost a hand because of me,

121
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,420
and suffered such a serious injury.

122
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,290
I feel very guilty about it.

123
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,380
You want to hide it from Immortal Luo Ge,

124
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,940
and you're acting like a thief.

125
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,140
Which thief are you talking about?

126
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,540
No, no, no.

127
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,980
What?  Don't listen to his...

128
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,700
Nonsense.

129
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,460
I... Why... why are you here?

130
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,220
Shouldn't... shouldn't you be

131
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,020
recuperating at Palace Chongyang?

132
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,380
Why are you here?

133
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,420
But why do I feel

134
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,900
that you are just acting like a thief?

135
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,220
Am I?

136
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,540
What's in the box?

137
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,100
Show me.

138
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,020
I thought a thief had come to Xiyin Mountain.

139
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,180
It turned out that the thief was not from outside,

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,700
but someone inside.

141
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,820
What... what are you talking about?

142
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,100
These are all my own stuff.

143
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,179
Can't I give... give them away?

144
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:40,690
I...

145
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,500
I... I'm just an errand runner.

146
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,690
I'm just a looker-on.

147
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,780
She is the mastermind.

148
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,780
You...

149
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,420
Since you are willing to do it,

150
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,980
help me get this to him.

151
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,540
This is the spirit vein of Water Dragon.

152
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,180
Although it's not as good as He Na's Demon King spirit vein,

153
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,060
it's close enough.

154
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,180
It's good for his hand.

155
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,900
It turns out that you have noticed it.

156
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,460
Have you been looking for it for a long time?

157
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,400
He Na is also my friend.

158
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,740
It turns out

159
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,460
that you are also a person who cares about friends.

160
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,820
I can't let you always pay people back

161
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,700
because you feel sorry for them, right?

162
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,940
Mr. Tai,

163
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,620
how long has it been since Luo Ning left?

164
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,220
I don't think it's been long.

165
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,940
I made an agreement with her

166
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,900
that no matter what happened to her after she went back,

167
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
she would come back to see me.

168
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,300
I think

169
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,380
she must have forgotten me this time.

170
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,020
Next time she comes back,

171
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,380
I will definitely trap her

172
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,740
so that she can never leave me.

173
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,620
General Fu,

174
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,780
you are just saying angry words.

175
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,100
It's useless to say so.

176
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,860
If Fairy Luo Ning is really angry about your words,

177
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,380
you definitely have to

178
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,620
apologize to her.

179
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,180
Shut up!

180
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,380
General Fu.

181
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,580
It seems that someone from Immortal Palace has come.

182
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,340
Luo Ning!

183
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,380
This is the spirit vein of Water Dragon that Immortal specially found for you.

184
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Please convey my gratitude to Immortal for me.

185
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,300
Liu Shao is very careful.

186
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,820
The medicinal herbs and supplements she sent

187
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,010
are very suitable for me.

188
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,570
It turned out that these were sent by Liu Shao.

189
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,850
Brother.

190
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,020
Can you stop treating that girl as a treasure?

191
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,460
She doesn't even care about you.

192
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,340
Look.

193
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,090
She can make you so happy

194
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,420
by just sending these crap.

195
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,940
Fu.

196
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,060
What are you talking about?

197
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,180
These are collected by Liu Shao

198
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,140
from Immortal Palace and the human world.

199
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,290
She put a lot of effort into it.

200
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,460
How could you say that?

201
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,620
Are you unhappy

202
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,220
that you failed to kill them?

203
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,500
What are you talking about, you old demon?

204
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,580
I didn't say it.

205
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,220
It was… Master Shang.

206
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,500
What did he say?

207
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,020
He said

208
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,500
that Moon Poison came from Xie Lingqi

209
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,220
and later used by Bai Feng.

210
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,580
The only one who could instruct them at the same time

211
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,140
and had the motive to be enemies

212
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,700
with Luo Ge and Liu Shao was Fu.

213
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,340
What you are saying now

214
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,940
is just baseless

215
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,820
speculation.

216
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,730
This is not my speculation.

217
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,820
Anyway,

218
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Master Shang

219
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,260
wouldn't think so for no reason.

220
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,860
They must have heard something.

221
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,500
That's the truth.

222
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,300
By the way,

223
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,100
Master Shang also said

224
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,340
that you may not be innocent as well,

225
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,300
because you were not afraid of Moon Poison.

226
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,660
Maybe

227
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,420
you were doing this to get close to Liu Shao

228
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,770
and had other plans.

229
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,860
It's fine if you just slander me,

230
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,060
don't slander my brother!

231
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:31,940
Fu.

232
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,020
Let him go!

233
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Even if the immortal world and the demon world are at war,

234
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,260
killing the envoy is forbidden.

235
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,700
I just ran errands to deliver the medicine

236
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,450
and almost got killed.

237
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,220
Fu!

238
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,340
How dare you pinch my neck?

239
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm going to learn that

240
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,300
and strangle him too!

241
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,420
Bai Feng?

242
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,940
Fu is completely different

243
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,180
from his brother.

244
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,380
How could they two be brothers?

245
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,540
I'll tell Liu Shao

246
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,620
and let her be careful of Fu.

247
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,020
Master.

248
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,940
Fairy Luo Ning.

249
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,180
Master.

250
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,380
I just

251
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,780
heard you mentioning Fu.

252
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,220
What happened to him?

253
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,780
I almost forgot.

254
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,820
Did you know Fu very well

255
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,420
when you were in human world?

256
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Yes.

257
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,860
Listen to me.

258
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,210
You should stay away from him.

259
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,100
What's going on?

260
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,140
Did he do something

261
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,530
against Immortal Palace?

262
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,130
Guess who I saw at the Moon Washing Pond

263
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,700
when I returned from the demon world?

264
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,540
Who?

265
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,130
Brother.

266
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,100
You don't really believe

267
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,540
that grass demon's nonsense, do you?

268
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,780
I probably know more

269
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,220
than Wan Sui.

270
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,530
Xie Lingqi

271
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,740
just handed Moon Poison

272
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,380
to the person under Four Seasons Monument.

273
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,540
I'd like to know

274
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,060
when you got in touch

275
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,180
with

276
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,380
that person.

277
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,420
So what?

278
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,810
As long as he could help my people,

279
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,220
I could cooperate with him and use him.

280
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,570
I don't care who he is.

281
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,140
What about Bai Feng and Xie Lingqi?

282
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,980
They have nothing to do with me.

283
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
Stop lying!

284
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,890
We may not be able to find Bai Feng yet,

285
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,020
but Xie Lingqi has already repented.

286
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,890
Do you want me to take you to confront him?

287
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,020
Xie Lingqi...

288
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,660
I did take advantage of him for a while.

289
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,580
But he humiliated you before,

290
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,180
so what's wrong with me using him

291
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,180
to teach Immortal Palace a lesson?

292
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,620
You used Xie Lingqi

293
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,210
to assassinate Liu Shao and Zhuo Qiuxian.

294
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,420
I tried my best to save you,

295
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,100
and promised them that I would discipline you strictly.

296
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,860
Now,

297
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,700
you did this again.

298
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,140
How do you want me to explain to Immortal Palace and Luo Ge?

299
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,700
Brother.

300
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,460
You are a demon.

301
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,100
It is enough for you, Demon King,

302
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,220
to maintain the peace of the demon world.

303
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,820
You don't need to explain anything to anyone.

304
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,890
If the Three Realms are in chaos,

305
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,570
our demon world will also be affected.

306
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,500
Guards!

307
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,740
-Yes. -Yes.

308
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,980
Fu was impulsive and reckless,

309
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,100
and has violated orders.

310
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,740
Whip him harshly

311
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,260
as a warning to others.

312
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,460
Luo Ning.

313
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,860
My brother punished me again today.

314
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,580
Among the Three Realms,

315
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,860
only you are close to me.

316
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
But you cruelly left me for so long.

317
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,340
Fu,

318
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,340
what are you plotting with Bai Feng again?

319
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,090
If I'm the only one who can lead you to kindness,

320
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,180
I can't let you go on making mistakes.

321
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,300
Fu,

322
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,940
I'll find out

323
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
who you really are

324
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,780
with my own eyes.

325
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,050
Luo Ge.

326
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,660
Guess what I have prepared for you.

327
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,099
I can't wait.

328
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,580
Luo Ge, don't bother.

329
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,740
You can only walk on the path

330
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,180
I have drawn for you.

331
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,700
Immortal Luo Ge isn't that powerful either.

332
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,660
No.

333
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,500
I can't let it mess up like this.

334
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,540
I must find it as soon as possible.

335
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,660
Master has only left for a few hours.

336
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,060
What brings you here again?

337
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,180
I want to figure something out,

338
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,860
so I need to be invisible.

339
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,620
Among Demon Palace,

340
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,260
your water energy

341
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,580
is the best at covering up the aura.

342
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,100
Along

343
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,500
with the invisible perfume I made,

344
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,740
I should be able to become invisible.

345
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,780
Are you trying to investigate Fu?

346
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,580
He didn't flirt with other girls.

347
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,820
Would you like to lend it to me or not?

348
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,300
Of course.

349
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,330
General Fu,

350
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,940
by the time you see your brother,

351
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,660
Bai Feng has already arrived.

352
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,060
Bai Feng?

353
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,220
Has anyone noticed?

354
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,940
There is a boundary around,

355
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,380
no one will see her.

356
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,540
Okay.

357
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,380
Fu.

358
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,540
I didn't ask you to come.

359
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,540
Why are you here?

360
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,380
Don't worry.

361
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
I've set up a boundary here.

362
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,260
The one from Immortal Palace asked me to find you,

363
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,260
saying that with your help,

364
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,860
we will be able to attack Immortal Palace and seize the sword.

365
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,900
Seize the sword?

366
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:50,860
No.

367
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,660
Even with the power of Aquatic Demons,

368
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,050
I'm afraid we can hardly be Luo Ge's opponent.

369
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,820
It would be fine if Yin-yang Cave trapped him,

370
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,090
but we lost our opportunity

371
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,540
because of you.

372
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,090
Fu

373
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,860
did all this?

374
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,780
What?

375
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,740
Both my brother and your brother entered Yin-yang Cave?

376
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,580
At least you can know their news

377
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,740
as soon as possible

378
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,780
if you stay here.

379
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,770
-He was lying to me. -Let me know if you have any news.

380
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,220
How about going to bed and resting for a while?

381
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,900
Or do you want me to make perfume with you?

382
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,220
How could you talk sweetly to me

383
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,100
while plotting

384
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,660
to kill my family?

385
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,380
Although I failed,

386
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
I told you

387
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,140
that I wanted to be with Luo Ge.

388
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,060
I never thought of taking Luo Ge's life.

389
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,900
I know.

390
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,180
But think about it.

391
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,900
If Luo Ge

392
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,300
is still an Immortal

393
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,820
or Supreme God,

394
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,810
will you have a chance to be with him?

395
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,060
Whether he is a mortal

396
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
or an immortal,

397
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
I will definitely be with him.

398
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,380
Great.

399
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,570
But remember,

400
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,500
if you want to be with him,

401
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,620
you have to continue to cooperate with me.

402
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,060
Luo Ge has been busy recovering recently,

403
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,740
and this is our opportunity.

404
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,540
Who is it?

405
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,900
Didn't you say there is a boundary here?

406
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,700
What is that?

407
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,700
How did I feel my brother's aura?

408
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,050
Demon King in White?

409
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,860
My brother wouldn't do such a sneaky thing.

410
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,570
Go back first.

411
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,700
I will let you know

412
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,660
if there is a plan for the next step.

413
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:21,620
Yes.

414
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,540
Luo Ning!

415
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,060
Luo Ning!

416
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,420
Luo Ning!

417
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,620
Luo Ning!

418
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,220
Who is it?

419
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,260
You killed so many of our fellow disciples!

420
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,450
Yes, it was him. Kill him!

421
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,220
Even if his immortal energy is depleted, he is still an Immortal.

422
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,460
I obviously asked you

423
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,660
to send Liu Shao to Luo Ge.

424
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,860
Remember,

425
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,020
what you want is to get Luo Ge.

426
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,930
And I am for my people.

427
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,340
That person is just one of our pawns.

428
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,340
Luo Ning.

429
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,410
You're awake.

430
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,780
Here.

431
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,100
Thank you.

432
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
What happened?

433
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,140
Luo Ning,

434
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,740
I'm really sorry.

435
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,900
I didn't expect Fu

436
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,940
to be so ambitious and reckless.

437
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,540
You don't need to apologize

438
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,260
for him.

439
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,420
Now,

440
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,060
even if he apologizes to me,

441
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,460
I won't forgive him.

442
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,540
From now on,

443
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,860
I will treat him like a stranger.

444
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,940
If he really dares to hurt my brother,

445
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,780
I will definitely kill him.

446
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,580
But you and Fu have already...

447
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,540
So what?

448
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,210
He touched my bottom line

449
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,300
and there is no way I can forgive him anymore.

450
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,170
Although he is excessively cruel,

451
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,360
his feeling for you

452
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,100
is real.

453
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,220
Do you really feel that way?

454
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,900
He keeps saying that he loves me,

455
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,620
but he tries to destroy Immortal Palace and hurt my family.

456
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,460
I don't need

457
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,820
this kind of love.

458
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,020
If he really force me to accept it,

459
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,780
then I'll have to kill him.

460
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,900
Either he dies

461
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,660
or I die.

462
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,220
I just want to ask

463
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,780
if you will

464
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,170
stop him.

465
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,420
I'll go back and tell my brother right away

466
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,740
if you won't.

467
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,300
By then,

468
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,060
I'm afraid

469
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,420
it won't be up to you to deal with it.

470
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,060
You don't have to worry about

471
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,580
the things Fu and Bai Feng discussed.

472
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,940
I will not let Fu have another chance

473
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,940
to leave Demon Palace again.

474
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,500
Got you. You are the traitor.

475
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,340
What's going on here?

476
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,860
Don't deny it!

477
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,940
What's going on?

478
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,580
Why is Xie Lingqi here?

479
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,740
Who allowed you to bring him out?

480
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,580
No, Immortal Master.

481
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,020
Immortal asked us to catch the traitor.

482
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,780
Coincidentally,

483
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,740
we saw this person preparing to escape

484
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,620
after destroying the Four Seasons Monument.

485
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,740
He must be the traitor.

486
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,020
I told you

487
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,540
I was stopped by you

488
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,700
while chasing the real traitor.

489
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,300
Tell me in detail.

490
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,530
What exactly

491
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,460
did you just see?

492
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,210
Well...

493
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,860
Four Seasons Monument was damaged,

494
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,100
and we only saw him running

495
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,020
when we arrived.

496
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,260
That must have been his doing.

497
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,810
Xie Lingqi

498
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,860
Xie Lingqi should have served his sentence under Four Seasons Monument

499
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,460
and now he should be severely punished

500
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,540
for escaping without permission.

501
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,980
I will abolish his cultivation

502
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,460
and interrogate him later.

503
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,780
No.

504
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,780
Immortal Master,

505
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,300
there are still doubts about this matter,

506
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,980
and we cannot make a conclusion now.

507
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,300
Let's investigate first.

508
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,780
Why is he still in Bone Melting Pool

509
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,820
if he's innocent?

510
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,220
You can not convince me with that.

511
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,420
Ge,

512
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,100
you are too softhearted.

513
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,580
If we don't deal with him,

514
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,020
what should we do

515
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,220
if the evil thing becomes stronger?

516
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,740
Take Xie Lingqi back to Bone Melting Pool first,

517
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,020
and forbid him to get out.

518
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,820
Do you have anything else to say?

519
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,940
I'll do as you say.

520
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,740
Madam,

521
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,660
I finally know

522
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,180
why Immortal Ze Shui would kill herself.

523
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,380
It turns out that being extremely disappointed with the one you love

524
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,660
is worse than death.

525
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,460
What's wrong?

526
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,180
Are you worried about me?

527
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,140
Don't worry.

528
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,300
I will not be like Ze Shui.

529
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,660
I'm really disappointed,

530
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,780
but I know what the right thing to do.

531
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,460
Luo Ning!

532
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,500
Luo Ning.

533
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,220
When did you come back?

534
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,100
Why didn't you tell me?

535
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,090
What's wrong?

536
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,980
You don't look well.

537
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,860
Are you hurt?

538
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,460
Who hurt you?

539
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,300
Tell me.

540
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,660
I'll cut him into pieces.

541
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,050
Remember

542
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
what you just said to me.

543
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,700
Follow me.

544
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,700
Luo Ning,

545
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,260
what do you come to my brother for?

546
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,940
What happened?

547
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,740
Demon King,

548
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,370
you said

549
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,860
you would deal with it.

550
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,820
Fu.

551
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,060
Come here.

552
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,620
Deal with what?

553
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,460
Does it have anything to do with me?

554
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,220
Or Luo Ning?

555
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,540
Fu.

556
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,020
Do you know what you are doing?

557
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,260
Fairy.

558
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,420
I've sealed his soul pill.

559
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,940
so that he cannot use spells.

560
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,780
And I will imprison him in the Demon Palace

561
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,420
and forbid him to go out for a hundred years.

562
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,900
Are you satisfied?

563
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,500
I don't think

564
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,540
a hundred years

565
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,660
is long enough.

566
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,220
Give him some pens and paper,

567
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,050
and let him transcribe books

568
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,900
to cultivate his mind.

569
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,820
What are you talking about?

570
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,900
What are you doing?

571
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,500
Just let him transcribe Meditation Spell.

572
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,060
Don't do anything evil,

573
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,300
and do more good things.

574
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,380
Give up evil thoughts

575
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,650
and work hard to cultivate yourself.

576
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,060
Don't do anything evil,

577
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,020
and do more good things.

578
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,570
Give up evil thoughts

579
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,580
and work hard to cultivate yourself.

580
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,140
Luo Ning,

581
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,380
are you despising me

582
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,340
because you blame me for doing too much evil?

583
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,380
It turns out that you are aware of what you have done.

584
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:22,860
Brother.

585
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,540
Even if I did something wrong,

586
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,140
it was because of a slight error in thought.

587
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,500
Are you really going to

588
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,050
imprison me for a hundred years?

589
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,820
Among the Three Realms,

590
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,530
I respect you the most,

591
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,820
and Luo Ning

592
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,340
is the one I love the most.

593
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,820
You could punish me if I did something wrong.

594
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,220
And I won't complain

595
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,340
even if I am punished by you in a harsh way.

596
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,450
I really didn't expect

597
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,580
that in the end

598
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,140
it would be you

599
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,340
who joined hands to imprison me for a hundred years.

600
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,300
Did I hear it wrong?

601
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,220
After a hundred years,

602
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,300
Luo Ge should be able to become Supreme God.

603
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:05,820
By then,

604
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,740
I don't have to worry about you working with Bai Feng

605
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,300
to release that evil God

606
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,780
and disrupt the Three Realms.

607
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,260
I'll let you out then.

608
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,860
So last night...

609
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,140
Who is it?

610
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,900
How did I feel my brother's aura?

611
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,940
Demon King in White?

612
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,740
My brother wouldn't do such a sneaky thing.

613
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,220
When did you come back?

614
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,380
Why didn't you tell me?

615
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,540
You said

616
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,260
that you would cut the person who hurt me into pieces.

617
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,890
Didn't you ask me

618
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,580
when I came back?

619
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,980
I came back yesterday.

620
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,140
I heard something

621
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,820
before.

622
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,460
I always thought

623
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
that you were just scheming,

624
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,100
but you wouldn't kill innocent people,

625
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,980
nor would you hurt my family.

626
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,860
So,

627
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,730
I borrowed some water energy from your brother.

628
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,330
I tried to use my own eyes

629
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,740
and ears

630
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,500
to

631
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,450
figure out

632
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,220
what kind of person

633
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,300
I once loved is.

634
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,060
Unfortunately,

635
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,500
I heard too much that I shouldn't have heard.

636
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,060
And I was almost

637
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,820
killed by you.

638
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,300
What?

639
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,260
Did I hurt you?

640
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:38,980
Luo Ning!

641
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,860
I don't need your concern.

642
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,580
Didn't you just promise me

643
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,980
to cut the person who hurt me into pieces?

644
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,930
Now,

645
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
you are just going to be held captive for a hundred years.

646
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,100
Luo Ning!

647
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,140
Luo Ning!

648
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,340
Luo Ning!

649
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,020
Luo Ning!

650
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,179
Luo Ning!

651
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,340
Tree Fairy.

652
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,980
Liu Shao said that you can sense emotions.

653
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,699
Are you

654
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,260
feeling sorry for me now?

655
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,900
They all say you have ten thousand years of memory.

656
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,020
Then tell me

657
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,380
if Ze Shui back then

658
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,420
was

659
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,260
the same as me today?

660

00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,630
♫I want to get close but I can't see clearly♫

691
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,260
Ze Shui!

692
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,980
Ze Shui!

693
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,300
Why did you do this to me?

694
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,590
♫Who arranged this rain?♫

695
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,180
Why did you do this?

696
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,700
How dare you hurt Ze Shui?

697
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,490
♫I want to avoid but I meet you again♫

698
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,740
You and your people

699
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:14,000
♫I can't help but stay with you♫

700
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,580
will pay for this!

701
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,140
I swear

702
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,170
that your people

703
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,300
♫The endless mountains and seas condensed into raindrops♫

704
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,140
will be imprisoned in the deep water forever,

705
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,980
♫I have walked thousands of miles with the feeling of missing you♫

706
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,020
and that they will die

707
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,860
when they leave the water.

708
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,500
♫I want to ask the prophecy where I should go♫

709
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,580
They will forever be despised

710
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,030
♫For whom did the foreshadowing disappear?♫

711
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,940
and will never be able to see the sun!

712
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,820
♫I want to find our way through destiny♫

713
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,620
Except for me,

714
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,900
this spell can only be lifted

715
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,950
♫I want to throw away the memory in exchange for you to come back♫

716
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,220
when one of Ze Shui's descendants become Demon Queen.

717
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:53,280
♫Raise the glass to reincarnate the world♫

718
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,320
♫I'll wait for your response with no regrets♫

719
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,880
♫I'll find the promised home for you♫

720
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:10,100
♫My heart aches and I will say yes again♫

721
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,310
♫When will we separate?♫

722
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:23,640
♫Please don't tell us our ending in advance♫

723
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,460
What's going on with the Mother of Trees?

724
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,260
She is so excited.

725
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:57,980
Yes.

726
00:39:59,540 --> 00:39:59,970
Look.

727
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,340
The Mother of Trees...

728
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,980
What's wrong?

729
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,140
It turns out that Immortal Ze Shui

730
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,260
loved him

731
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,660
like I loved Fu.

732
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,340
But she suffered a lot,

733
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,500
and even dragged her people to suffer together.

734
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,500
Luo Ning,

735
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,100
Fu did a lot of wrong things.

736
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,780
I'm really sorry.

737
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,060
I did not teach him well.

738
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,100
I'm his brother.

739
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,100
It's my responsibility.

740
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,620
Have you ever thought

741
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,660
that there might be other ways

742
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,020
to break the curse

743
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,660
besides breaking Four Seasons Monument?

744
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,460
There should

745
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,980
be.

746
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,460
But we tried it before

747
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,860
and it didn't work at all.

748
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,540
Right?

749
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
That's because

750
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
I only inherited Ze Shui's immortal energy,

751
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,180
but not her resentment.

752
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,860
Even if I tried to think about how to forgive him,

753
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,380
it wouldn’t work.

754
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,610
But

755
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,940
the memory of Brahma tree just show me

756
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,660
that as long as one of Ze Shui's descendants

757
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,020
becomes the Demon Queen,

758
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,340
she will have the right to forgive your people

759
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,180
and lift their ten thousand year curse.
