[Episode 30]

4
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,100
We've been in here too long.

5
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,020
We have to find the crack as soon as possible.

6
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,060
I'm afraid

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,539
we won't be able to get out later.

8
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,460
I'm affected by Yin-yang Power.

9
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,780
I can't use the water spirit.

10
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,620
Luo Ge.

11
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,979
I can only count on you.

12
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,979
If the Immortal does something,

13
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,380
the boundary can be barely opened

14
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,740
for a moment.

15
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,380
They're coming.

16
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,820
I'll go stop them first.

17
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,740
Shiwei.

18
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,460
Luo Ge, what should we do?

19
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,220
He Na.

20
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,220
You go first.

21
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,860
Hurry.

22
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,420
Okay.

23
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,810
Luo Ge.

24
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,620
Come on out.

25
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,100
What are you doing?

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,530
Luo Ge, what do you mean?

27
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,020
He Na.

28
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,940
Take care of Liu Shao for me.

29
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,140
Luo Ge.

30
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,940
I have to stay here to cleanse the evil spirit.

31
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,500
Luo Ge!

32
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,980
The poison is finally gone.

33
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,220
But if Liu Shao wakes up,

34
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm sure she'll ask to save Luo Ge.

35
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,340
I'm injured now.

36
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,900
I can't help them.

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,660
Brother.

38
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,620
You're injured again?

39
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,580
What's so good about that Liu Shao?

40
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,090
She's gotten you into trouble again and again.

41
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,340
Luo Ning came here.

42
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,620
Mr. Tai told you?

43
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,860
I can't let her see you come back.

44
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,860
If she knows

45
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,010
Luo Ge is still in Yin-yang Cave,

46
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,459
I'm afraid she'll make it a big deal.

47
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,620
She's Luo Ge's sister.

48
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,220
There are some things

49
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,820
she should know.

50
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,740
If Luo Ge dies today,

51
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,060
it can only be good for us.

52
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,540
Fu.

53
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,980
The Three Realms are inextricably linked.

54
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,540
If something happens to Luo Ge,

55
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,460
it can't be good for the demon world.

56
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,620
Even if it's for Luo Ning's sake,

57
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,180
you shouldn't let her down.

58
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,940
Why not?

59
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,580
Luo Ge is the stumbling block

60
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,610
for us to break free.

61
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,540
You're always like this.

62
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,700
I'm afraid you'll regret it one day.

63
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,460
I see.

64
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,740
This is the medicine I had Mr. Tai recently make.

65
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,250
It should be good for your hand.

66
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,300
Immortal.

67
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,690
Your immortal energy is already damaged.

68
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,770
You don't have to stay for us.

69
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,340
We're all disciples of the Immortal Palace.

70
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,700
I won't give up on you.

71
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,580
And the evil spirit in the cave can affect the Four Seasons Monument at any time.

72
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,740
Only by setting up a formation with my immortal energy

73
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,460
can I purify the resentment of the fellow disciples

74
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,180
at once.

75
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,100
It's also my wish.

76
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,820
I'm willing to do my small part.

77
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,780
I've already found her.

78
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,020
My wish has been fulfilled.

79
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,180
I don't

80
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,140
ask for your protection.

81
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,020
If you need me,

82
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,300
I would kill or die for you.

83
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,100
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,540
You're a righteous man

85
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,810
of honor.

86
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,580
The Immortal will protect you.

87
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,340
I'm ashamed to say

88
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,740
that I...

89
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,500
Since you want to help,

90
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,460
why don't we split up

91
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,900
and set up the formation with my immortal energy?

92
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,860
Xie Lingqi.

93
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,770
You've been guarding the Three Realms for a thousand years.

94
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,140
It's a blessing for the Immortal Palace.

95
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,020
You have to do a lot more

96
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,340
for the Immortal Palace in the future.

97
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,250
I will complete whatever I'm entrusted with.

98
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,460
Luo Ge.

99
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,820
Liu Shao.

100
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,659
He Na.

101
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,580
Where is Luo Ge?

102
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,900
He stayed in the cave.

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,700
He said he had to purify the evil spirit

104
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,900
and let us out first.

105
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,700
I've unblocked

106
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,660
the restraint Bai Feng placed on the Wang Bell.

107
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,180
Luo Ge.

108
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,220
Luo Ge, are you okay?

109
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,460
I'm fine.

110
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,300
Why didn't you come out?

111
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,540
You don't have to worry.

112
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm staying here

113
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,490
to resolve

114
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,970
the resentment of the disciples of the Immortal Palace.

115
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,020
You should rest well.

116
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,220
Don't worry about me.

117
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,420
Is it because you're affected by our incompatible spiritual power?

118
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,860
Anyway,

119
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,820
no matter what,

120
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,060
you'll come out.

121
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,650
You will definitely come out, right?

122
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,220
What if

123
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,290
I can't get out

124
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,140
and I'm trapped here?

125
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,620
Will you wait for me?

126
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,820
If you can't get out,

127
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,820
I'll get married to another guy.

128
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,860
How dare you?

129
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,300
So consider it for my sake,

130
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,940
come out, please.

131
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,419
Okay.

132
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,380
I will.

133
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,700
You're leaving?

134
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,900
If you're going to Yin-yang Cave,

135
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,660
can you wait for me for a couple of days?

136
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,090
I'll go with you

137
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,900
after a short rest.

138
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,500
Although you won't tell me,

139
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,180
I know you're badly hurt.

140
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,300
Just stay here and recuperate.

141
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,220
But you…

142
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,820
Don't worry.

143
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,650
I won't act impulsively.

144
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,140
I will go back to the Immortal Palace

145
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,380
and ask the seniors for help.

146
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,740
That's good.

147
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,170
The one who sealed the cave

148
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,340
was Shang Yurong's father,

149
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,180
Lord Shang.

150
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,530
Go to Shang Yurong.

151
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,180
He will help you.

152
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,780
Okay.

153
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,020
No matter what,

154
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,540
I will get Luo Ge out of there.

155
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,580
You will.

156
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,980
Master Shang, Immortal Master.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,060
Liu Shao.

158
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,740
Do you recognize your fault?

159
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,380
I don't understand.

160
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,890
You promised not to see Luo Ge again.

161
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,300
Not only did you break your promise,

162
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,340
you even got Luo Ge into the Ying-yang Cave.

163
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,980
Now that you're out,

164
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,260
why hasn't he come out yet?

165
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,060
He...

166
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,060
He...

167
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,660
Luo Ge just sent me a message,

168
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,980
saying he had to

169
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,180
purify the evil spirit in the Ying-yang Cave.

170
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,460
He can take it as a cultivation

171
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,660
which can also

172
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,740
stabilizes the Four Seasons Monument.

173
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,620
Nonsense.

174
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,500
If no one had broken into the cave,

175
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,020
there would not be any evil spirit turmoil.

176
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,450
If Luo Ge's cultivation is damaged again this time,

177
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,250
can you afford the responsibility, Liu Shao?

178
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,620
Let's go to the Ying-yang Cave.

179
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,140
We have to get Luo Ge out as soon as possible.

180
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,980
The Tian Kui Formation I asked you to set up

181
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,340
can eliminate all the evil spirit

182
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
within the area covered by the formation.

183
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,620
After the center is set up,

184
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,380
Tian Kui Formation

185
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,940
will activate itself in one hour.

186
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,980
It's finally done.

187
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,860
Shiwei.

188
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,900
See if there's an antidote on these people.

189
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,980
I found it.

190
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,740
Lingqi.

191
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,460
I found it.

192
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,380
Shiwei.

193
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,780
This is the fourth bottle we found.

194
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
You're good.

195
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
Let's go meet up with Luo Ge.

196
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,780
Let's go.

197
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,220
Okay.

198
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,340
Let's go.

199
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,180
What's wrong with you?

200
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,100
Let's go.

201
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,060
Don't scare me.

202
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,660
Wake up.

203
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,780
I'm Lingqi.

204
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm Lingqi.

205
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,740
I just...

206
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:10,940
Shiwei.

207
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,300
Your will is stronger than others.

208
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,260
And you've practiced mind-clearing cultivation.

209
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,020
That's why you've been able to

210
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
barely keep sober.

211
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,100
But...

212
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,860
But I've been here for a thousand years.

213
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,020
The Moon Poison has already penetrated my bones.

214
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,500
It can't be eradicated.

215
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,180
I could lose my mind at any time,

216
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,340
or even harm those around me.

217
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,660
Right?

218
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,300
You can collect more Sun Spring.

219
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
You only need a small amount to recover

220
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,860
with your physical state.

221
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,140
I'm not afraid.

222
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm happy

223
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,980
to see you again.

224
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,380
Even if I have to go back…

225
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,740
Don't say that.

226
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,300
Immortal Luo Ge is here.

227
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,780
We will be fine.

228
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,980
It's okay.

229
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,660
I won't leave you here alone again

230
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,020
this time.

231
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,060
Liu Shao.

232
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,610
Why are you here?

233
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,620
I know your immortal energy is damaged.

234
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,340
I brought an expert to help you.

235
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,860
An expert?

236
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,580
Luo Ge.

237
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,580
You should be recuperating at Place Chonghua.

238
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,820
Why are you back?

239
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,380
And with an expert?

240
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,220
Luo Ge.

241
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,090
Could you expect

242
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,140
that you need me to save you one day?

243
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,020
Shang Yurong.

244
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
I'm afraid your Burning Sea

245
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,860
is not enough.

246
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,420
We still got a fairy here, right?

247
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,420
Liu Shao.

248
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,340
Stand back.

249
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Burning Sea?

250
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,580
I thought he didn't acquire it after hundreds of years of practice.

251
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,530
Shang Yurong acquired it

252
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,020
500 years ago.

253
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:34,980
Watch out.

254
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,500
They're coming after us.

255
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,700
They've been trapped here for a thousand years.

256
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,380
It's their obsession to get out.

257
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,940
As long as there's a loophole in the boundary,

258
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,740
they will do whatever it takes to escape.

259
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,660
Immortal.

260
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,570
You're wounded.

261
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,460
Let us do it.

262
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,060
Liu Shao.

263
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,140
Attack the rift.

264
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,740
Even the Lightning Slash can't break it.

265
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,540
Liu Shao.

266
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,100
Do you have any other moves?

267
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,100
If you do,

268
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,060
use it.

269
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Help me.

270
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,900
Liu Shao.

271
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,940
Inject Qi into your body and help the yin with the yang.

272
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,010
Bodhi palms together, hand-knotted with a flower.

273
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,220
Hide the hollowness of Taixu, and make your mind fall into the sea of Qi.

274
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,260
The heart moves with the hands and the music of heaven comes out.

275
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,460
This is the power of the Sun.

276
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,580
Luo Ge.

277
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,260
Come out.

278
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,460
Help me maintain the boundary crack.

279
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,820
Xie Lingqi, come out!

280
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,740
Shiwei.

281
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,220
Go!

282

Come back!

283
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,540
I can't hold on anymore.

Hurry up.

285
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,340
Hurry up.

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,760
♫I exiled my thousand-year-old body♫

344
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,190
♫Waiting for the ashes to slowly burn in the heart♫

345
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:45,950
♫Wait until the end of life to see the begonia turn red again♫

346
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,980
I'll go plead for General Xie

347
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,500
in front of the senior.

348
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,580
I hope she'll lighten his punishment.

349
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,060
Okay.

350
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,410
Xie Lingqi.

351
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,380
If you don't mind,

352
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,660
you can stay at Palace Chonghua first.

353
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,020
I will explain everything

354
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,780
to Master Zhuo.

355
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,100
That's not necessary.

356
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,300
In Shiwei's mind,

357
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,140
I'm a righteous

358
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,050
and responsible man.

359
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,930
I can't let her down.

360
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,820
I will return to the Bone Melting Pool from today.

361
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,060
I will be punished

362
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,700
as I should be

363
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,900
for the wrong I have done.

364
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,020
This is the Sun Spring

365
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,970
I've collected with Shiwei these days.

366
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,820
Now she

367
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,420
won't use it anymore.

368
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,620
So take it

369
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,820
as our token of appreciation.

370
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,700
You can use it for your health.

371
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,340
Take it as the least contribution

372
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,100
Shiwei did

373
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,180
for all beings in the Three Realms.

374
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,380
Thank you, General Yu.

375
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,210
My condolences.

376
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,930
Luo Ge.

377
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,540
If I were trapped for a thousand years,

378
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,300
would you

379
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,540
never give up looking for me

380
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,700
like Xie Lingqi did?

381
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,380
I can't bear

382
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,140
to let you be trapped for a thousand years either.

383
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,780
The pain of a thousand years of departure is unbearable.

384
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,380
So I want to find

385
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,860
the way to eliminate the conflict of spiritual powers.

386
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,940
But the fragments of Sun Spirit

387
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,780
have been fused with you.

388
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,890
I will find another way for you.

389
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,820
I have to seal the spirit energy as soon as possible.

390
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,260
I can't let Luo Ge get hurt for me again.

391
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,180
Luo Ge is out?

392
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,940
Yes.

393
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,860
Shang Yurong, Master of the Three Palaces,

394
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,300
saved Luo Ge from death

395
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,740
with the Burning Sea.

396
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,580
I never thought he would be so lucky.

397
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,740
The Immortal is safe and sound.

398
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,860
You can return to the Immortal Palace at any time

399
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,420
to reunite with him.

400
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,180
Your injury...

401
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,980
It's just a minor injury.

402
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,260
It's nothing to worry about.

403
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,140
If you're not treated in time,

404
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,340
will it

405
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,380
be dangerous?

406
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,620
You don't have to bother, Fairy Luo Ning.

407
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Bone-corroding Harp?

408
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,140
Fairy.

409
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
If you are willing to help me,

410
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,380
can you lift the curse of Aquatic Demons?

411
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,900
I...

412
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,900
Can I do it?

413
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,380
Legend has it that Immortal Ze Shui

414
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,700
can lift the curse

415
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,860
with the Bone-corroding Harp.

416
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,340
You should be the successor of Immortal Ze Shui's immortal energy.

417
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,020
If you are willing to do so,

418
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,740
I'd like you to give it a try.

419
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,020
Okay.

420
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,820
Bone-corroding Harp.

421
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,580
Luo Ning.

422
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,220
Demon King.

423
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,980
I'm afraid

424
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,740
I can't lift the curse.

425
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,860
As I thought about lifting the curse,

426
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,220
my hands got powerless.

427
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,260
Maybe it's because

428
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,020
someone doesn't think

429
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,380
I'm qualified.

430
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,860
Even the inheritor of Immortal Ze Shui

431
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,660
can't break the curse?

432
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,180
Tell me.

433
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
I'm coming back with a straight face.

434
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,300
What should I say

435
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,660
to the Immortal Master?

436
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,260
No need to explain.

437
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,300
I have something to discuss with you.

438
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,620
Liu Shao, you're finally back.

439
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,220
Is it cold in the house?

440
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,380
I'll go back first.

441
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,740
Liu Shao.

442
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,300
What's wrong with you?

443
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,220
Are you okay?

444
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,930
Master.

445
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,940
I want to seal the divine spirit.

446
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,700
I need your help to do so.

447
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,460
Luo Ning.

448
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Your brother has left the Ying-yang Cave

449
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,100
and is back at the Immortal Palace.

450
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,740
I know.

451
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,940
Your brother has just told me.

452
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,130
My brother?

453
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,490
Yes.

454
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,660
He cares about your brother.

455
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,860
Why are you here again?

456
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,460
I was thinking about

457
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,890
the curse of your clan.

458
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Since it's caused by

459
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,540
the Demon King and Immortal Ze Shui,

460
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,140
I think

461
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,340
the Brahma Tree

462
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,780
should know something.

463
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,540
But

464
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,620
I can feel the presence of the tree spirit.

465
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,020
I can also feel

466
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,340
it's very friendly to me.

467
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
But it just won't say anything to me.

468
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,580
Anyway, the curse

469
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,340
has been trapping us for 10,000 years.

470
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,700
No matter what,

471
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,500
I will

472
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,620
get rid of it.

473
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,740
Don't take the wrong path.

474
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,660
I'll listen to you.

475
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,810
I won't take the wrong path.

476
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,460
Okay?

477
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,010
You're just saying that.

478
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,420
But you don't think that way at all.

479
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,190
Am I right?

480
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,410
That's not true.

481
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,260
You're watching over me,

482
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,540
aren't you?

483
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,740
Does it help?

484
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,380
Even if I'm watching you,

485
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,700
will you listen to me?

486
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,700
Can I clear your bad thoughts?

487
00:30:59,540 --> 00:30:59,980
All right.

488
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,610
I'm going back to the Immortal Palace.

489
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,690
Why do you have to go back again?

490
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,140
I think your brother

491
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,860
is also worried about this every day.

492
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
Since this is caused by

493
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,940
Immortal Ze Shui,

494
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,850
I, as the inheritor of her immortal energy,

495
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,020
should have a chance to solve this.

496
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,410
I'm thinking about

497
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,940
asking my brother

498
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,100
and those

499
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,250
elders in the Immortal Palace.

500
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,930
Maybe there will be some clues.

501
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,220
It's about the Aquatic Demons.

502
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,940
What's the point of asking a bunch of old men

503
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
in the Immortal Palace?

504
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,820
I'll take care of the demon realm.

505
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,140
Why don't you

506
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,740
just be a happy little fairy?

507
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,820
No.

508
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,260
Who knows what other crazy things you'll do

509
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,580
to lift the curse?

510
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,460
Okay, that's it.

511
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm really going back.

512
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,100
I forbid you to go.

513
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,290
Who knows

514
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,500
when you'll be back?

515
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,940
You forbid me?

516
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,860
How?

517
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,060
You're locking me up

518
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,260
and won't let me go out?

519
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,940
No.

520
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,220
Fu.

521
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,420
Remember.

522
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,620
You're not the Demon King from 10,000 years ago.

523
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,180
I'm not Immortal Ze Shui either.

524
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,300
So

525
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,180
don't always think of imitating the Demon King,

526
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,060
understand?

527
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,620
Yes, I understand.

528
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,860
Whether you find the way or not,

529
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,460
you have to promise me one thing.

530
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,260
Don't come back too late to see me.

531
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,780
Three days.

532
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,020
Five days.

533
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,740
Seven days.

534
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
It depends on my mood.

535
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,060
At least give me a message.

536
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,660
Half a month at most.

537
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Don't leave me for a long time.

538
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,980
What little fairy?

539
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,980
She's a little witch.

540
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,020
She comes and goes

541
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,100
whenever she likes.

542
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,260
What does she take me for?

543
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,340
What a princess!

544
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,140
Mother of Trees.

545
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,180
You're treating me like this too.

546
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,020
I can chop you up and burn you as firewood.

547
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,220
The Mother of Trees

548
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,380
is also a princess

549
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,380
like Luo Ning.

550
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,460
Now she's gone.

551
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,660
I wonder how long it will take for her to return.

552
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,580
No way.

553
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,380
I must marry her.

554
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,780
When she comes next time,

555
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,460
I'll make her happy first

556
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,660
and then talk to my brother about it.

557
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,380
That's it.

558
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,740
So you asked us to come here

559
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,100
to nourish

560
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,900
Liu Shao's body?

561
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,820
Yes.

562
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,740
She only has one talisman pearl left in her body.

563
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,060
And all that she's been through

564
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,690
has affected her cultivation.

565
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,980
So

566
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,180
I want your help.

567
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,580
Maybe you can see something that I can't.

568
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,340
Even if it's just

569
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,260
a little clue.

570
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,090
You're being overly greedy.

571
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,900
Her spiritual power has been damaged.

572
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,139
It's difficult to cultivate again.

573
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,540
Do you want to spoil it?

574
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,020
But

575
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,820
if you stew him,

576
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,780
Liu Shao's cultivation level can rise by at least one or two steps.

577
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,060
Think twice about it, Immortal.

578
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,780
Don't look at me like that.

579
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,420
Master.

580
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,060
You've lived for 10,000 years.

581
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,580
That's about right.

582
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,929
Immortal.

583
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:34,699
Master.

584
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,940
I remember how good you are to Liu Shao.

585
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,500
Immortal.

586
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,780
Remember to burn some ghost money for me

587
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,820
on festivals.

588
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,929
Gold dollars would do too.

589
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,139
Prepare the medicine on the list.

590
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,420
Maybe you won't need the ghost money.

591
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,580
You might as well stew me up.

592
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,540
The Immortal Master scolded Master Shang.

593
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,900
Immortal Luo broke into the Ying-yang Cave.

594
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,220
My “Anecdote of the Xiyin Mountain”

595
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,340
is further enriched.

596
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,780
Liu Shao.

597
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,700
You're still thinking about sealing the divine energy?

598
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,610
I already have the Tears of the Half-Demon.

599
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,340
What I don't have now is

600
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,420
the assistance of three immortals whose cultivation is above the general.

601
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,940
Shang Yurong is easy to deal with.

602
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,100
But I don't know

603
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,300
how to convince Master Zhuo.

604
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,340
It's simple.

605
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,130
Why don't you let Shang Yurong do it for you?

606
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,140
Zhuo Qiuqin has been very nice to Shang Yurong these days.

607
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,380
You won't

608
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,090
really seal the divine energy

609
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,860
for the Immortal, will you?

610
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,850
It will only make him worry

611
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,060
if I tell him I plan to do it.

612
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,060
Forget it.

613
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,380
Master.

614
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,460
The Immortal asks to see you.

615
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,500
You are

616
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,780
always tormenting me.

617
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,260
What medicines are still missing?

618
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,420
What are you rushing for?

619
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,900
I've never even seen

620
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,580
some of them before.

621
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,580
Baffling Star Stone.

622
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,660
Clear Vine.

623
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,100
See?

624
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,500
Where can I find it for you?

625
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Immortal Luo Ge.

626
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,450
These herbs are not just for health.

627
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,260
They can also enhance

628
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,020
Liu Shao's Sun Spirit.

629
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,260
Aren't you afraid

630
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,340
that it will make your spiritual power

631
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,460
even more incompatible?

632
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,580
Isn't the Clear Vine you mentioned

633
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,820
in the Bone Melting Pool?

634
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,210
Yes.

635
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,380
But it takes the power of a God to find it.

636
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,140
What about the Baffling Star Stone?

637
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,620
That's even harder to find.

638
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,740
That was the collection of the Demon King ten thousand years ago.

639
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,060
Demon King?

640
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,580
Immortal.

641
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,820
The Demon King requests an audience.

642
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,020
I thought you would meet me at Litian Temple

643
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,340
or at Palace Chonghua.

644
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,820
When Liu Shao and I were at our wit's end,

645
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,460
it was you who stood in front of us,

646
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,300
saying

647
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,460
we were your friends.

648
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,900
So you remembered.

649
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,740
I remembered after I ascended to immortality.

650
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,660
Lu Li's friend

651
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,580
is also my friend.

652
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,380
I hadn't mentioned it deliberately before.

653
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,700
But it's not because I forgot.

654
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,780
In fact,

655
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,940
I've always considered you my best friend too.

656
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,380
He Na.

657
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,260
Since you said we are friends,

658
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,580
there is no need to be polite.

659
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,660
If you have anything to say, say it.

660
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,500
[From the Demon King He Na]

661
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,860
The immortals and demons are bound to each other.

662
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,900
From now on, we will live in peace

663
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,180
with no more conflicts.

664
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,740
He Na.

665
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,260
That's a good wish.

666
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,650
Do you think it's improper?

667
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,740
I think it's good too.

668
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,530
And I hope that one day it will be so.

669
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,300
But there is Xie Lingqi in the Immortal Palace.

670
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,500
And so does the Demon Palace.

671
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,740
Someone at the Demon Palace caused trouble?

672
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,780
Xie Lingqi should be the only one who has

673
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,500
the Moon Poison Liu Shao suffers from.

674
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,380
From Xie Lingqi's hiding to Bai Feng's poisoning,

675
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,940
I suspect

676
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
someone passed it on.

677
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,860
You mean Fu?

678
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,460
You are the king of the demon realm.

679
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,220
If Fu makes a mistake,

680
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,300
how can you convince the people?

681
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,860
I see you as a friend.

682
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,820
But I can't give Fu a break

683
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,300
because of you.

684
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,260
I think you can understand that.

685
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,780
I understand.

686
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,820
There's one more thing I want to ask you.

687
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,380
What is it?

688
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Just say it.

689
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,700
In the cave,

690
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,380
Liu Shao forced out

691
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,900
the divine weapon of the Sun, the Crown Wheel.

692
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,260
She should be able to inherit the power of the Sun soon.

693
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,740
So I want to find some herbs

694
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,820
to boost her divine energy.

695
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,500
and help with her cultivation.

696
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,420
Is there any medicine that is not available at the Immortal Palace?

697
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,130
Baffling Star Stone.

698
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,580
What's that?

699
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,090
The Brahma Tree is glowing.

700
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,300
It's...

701
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,980
His Majesty's Demon King's power.

702
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,020
Could it be that His Majesty

703
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,540
is searching for something

704
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,330
with his power as the Demon King?

705
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,420
He's actually using the spiritual power of Demon King.
