you are leaving tomorrow.

we shall give you a toast.

Later,

you'll go to the Immortal Palace to observe the ceremony.

Then we will meet again.

Well...

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,020
It will be in the Immortal Palace.

I'm looking at the moon on the willow branch.

23
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,860
You should look at the willow branch [referring to Liu Shao] in front of you.

Liu Shao.

25

Try it.

30
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,100
Of course you should.

31

can really help the Immortal Palace get the Four Seasons Tablet restored.

Marquis Wuyang asked me to look over the arrival of Immortal,

59
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,940
I saw you two

60

through the Mansion's Xuantian Mirror.

61
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,900
So this time,

62
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,820
was it you who gave me the chance?

63
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,900
It was the Bone-Corroding Harp

64
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,020
that gave you the chance.

65
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,700
You are the new heir chosen by Marquis Wuyang?

66

Where can we find it without you telling us?

Don't worry. Since we're here, let's take it easy.

Actually, I've been here when young.

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,100
This is the magic taught in the Immortal Palace?

98
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,820
Look at their posture.

99
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,140
Just like so, right?

100
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,930
Do I look like them?

101
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,460
Look.

102
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,260
There are waterfalls in the sky?

103
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,220
But you should have seen it before.

104
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,260
I just took a look from afar.

105
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,620

106
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,100
I wish this could last forever.

107
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,580
Are you really going to stay here forever?

108
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,820
I just want

109
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,100
to be with you forever.

110
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,620
I'm now under the Four Seasons Tablet.

111
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,660
As long as I pull out the Moon Sword,

112
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,980
I can be with Liu Shao forever.

113
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,340
But Liu Shao was ordered to repair the Tablet.

114
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,570
Should I tell this to her?

115

Lu Li.

116
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,060
Why are you spacing out?

117
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,940
I went to wash some fruits just now.

118
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,330
Have a taste to see whether it's sweet.

119
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,100
Is it sweet?

120
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,300
You too.

121
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,540
I wonder what's the need of cultivating

122
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,450
for these immortals.

123
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,060
Our life now

124
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,100
should be what immortals's life is like.

125
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,100
They asked me to cultivate myself here.

126
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,780
But...

127
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,340
I've been here for so many days.

128
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,300
They didn't give me any classes.

129
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Classes?

130
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,260
They only want your Bone-Corroding Harp.

131
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,220
As long as you help get the Four Seasons Tablet restored,

132
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,900
they definitely will accept you.

133
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,020
But if I fail to get it restored,

134
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,420
will they drive me back?

135
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,820
What are you thinking?

136
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,300
You know what?

137
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,180
They've prepared a lot

138
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,650
to repair the Four Seasons Tablet.

139
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,380
They just want to make use

140
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,940
of the Bone-Corroding Harp's healing effect.

141
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,540
If

142
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,180
you fail to get it repaired,

143
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,420
and ruin their plan,

144
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,020
then...

145
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,060
you will directly

146
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,660
be thrown under the waterfall for feeding the fish.

147
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
You've made the Immortal Palace described

148
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,420
more terrifying than Ao Hen.

149
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,620
It doesn't matter.

150
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,620
Maybe I can get the Four Seasons Tablet restored.

151
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,100
By then,

152
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,330
I can beg them

153
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,380
to let you stay here together with me.

154
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,010
In that case,

155
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,620
I would appreciate it a lot, Miss Liu.

156
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,020
You're welcome.

157
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,540
But you...

158
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,290
you still have to take charge of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

159
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,700
What if they don't allow me to go back?

160
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,380
Boring.

161
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,380
Let me show you this.

162
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,140
What is this?

163
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:47,860
Here you go.

164
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,300
This is the magic doll?

165
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,340
Yes.

166
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,940
On the day when you drew the sword,

167
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,620
Bai Feng used this to deceive you.

168
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,420
Unfortunately, I don't have enough power.

169
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,340
I can only conjure myself.

170
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,100
But my master.

171
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,580
can not only conjure me,

172
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,620
but also...

173
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,620
Don't be angry anymore.

174
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,460
From now on, I'll never

175
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,260
be cheated by these things again.

176
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,690
I will believe you in the future.

177
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,060
I only

178
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,500
trust you,

179
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,660
not what I see with my eyes,

180
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,420
or what I hear with my ears.

181
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,700
I'll only believe you.

182
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,380
What?

183
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,170
Are you here to laugh at me?

184
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,530
I just want to laugh at the Immortal Palace.

185
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,460
Are you interested?

186
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,820
No.

187
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,700
I just want to

188
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,090
burn down the Immortal Palace

189
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,620
and use all of their blood inside

190
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,220
to worship my son, Ao Yin.

191
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,860
Let's do it together.

192
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,100
They're going to repair the Four Seasons Tablet tomorrow.

193
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,860
We can watch the ceremony.

194
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,130
Tomorrow?

195
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,940
But there will be protection spells cast

196
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,060
outside the Immortal Palace.

197
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,220
Can you really get in?

198
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,060
Where is Liu Shao?

199
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,620
Liu Shao.

200
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,900
You asked me out

201
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,980
to talk about repairing the Four Seasons Tablet?

202
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,340
No, no.

203
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,340
I've treated myself with the Bone-Corroding Harp.

204
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,940
I can feel its power.

205
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,780
It won't go wrong.

206
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,100
Then you are...

207
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,420
It's about Lu Li.

208
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,580
He had the Soul-Devouring Spell cast upon him.

209
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,460
Although

210
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,500
it's temporarily quelled,

211
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,260
But this is not a long-term solution.

212
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,380
So I want to say,

213
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,500
if I can get the Four Seasons Tablet restored,

214
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,430
can the Immortal Palace help

215
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,130
remove the Soul-Devouring Spell from him?

216
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,980
I can give up the chance to cultivate in the Immortal Palace.

217
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,220
I only wish...

218
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,100
for Lu Li's safety and well-being.

219
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,180
Are you sure?

220
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,570
Yes, I'm very sure.

221
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,820
We'll talk about it after you restore the Four Seasons Tablet.

222
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,900
Have you really decided?

223
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,780
Of course.

224
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,380
But mortals

225
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,660
won't live long.

226
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,620
I don't want

227
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,060
to cultivate alone for thousands of years.

228
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,420
I always wanted to go to the Immortal Palace

229
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,220
and marry an immortal.

230
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,900
But now,

231
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,820
I have you.

232
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,010
As long as I'm with you for this life,

233
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,740
I don't think it's a loss.

234
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,170
No.

235
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,060
It will be my fortune.

236
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,980
A great fortune.

237
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,300
Okay.

238
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,820
I'll ask Lord to be the matchmaker after we go back,

239
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,820
and go propose marriage to you.

240
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,580
Maybe there will be a lucky day for us

241
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,220
to get married this year.

242
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,100
By the way,

243
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,180
when we get married,

244
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,860
we should invite Wang Jian and Xue.

245
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,060
And He Na.

246
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,490
You're right.

247
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,220
We can't forget him.

248
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,850
Although

249
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,740
I really don't like that fake fish demon.

250
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,140
By then,

251
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,380
we can build a house next to Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

252
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,660
Yes.

253
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,260
We need to raise a rabbit.

254
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,380
Okay.

255
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,650
And sheep.

256
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:32,700
My Lord.

257
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,900
Brother.

258
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,100
This way, please.

259
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,859
Today is the day

260
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,180
for the Immortal Palace and the Mortal World

261
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,770
to celebrate the grand event.

262
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,420
A song to mend the heaven

263
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,420
so that the friendship between immortals and mortals will be eternal.

264
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,900
Rise!

265
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,540
What a big scene!

266
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,860
So,

267
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,660
this is how the Immortal Palace

268
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,660
protect the human world.

269
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,020
Today,

270
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,300
I will also become one to protect the mortal world.

271
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,380
Liu Shao.

272
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,300
Play the Bone-Corroding Harp

273
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,860
to restore the Four Seasons Tablet.

274
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,900
Concentrate.

275
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,420
Calm down.

276
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,650
Bone-Corroding Harp.

277
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,700
Out.

278
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,700
Look over there.

279
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,420
The cracks are decreasing.

280
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,130
Yes.

281
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,700
It's getting restored.

282
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,220
Senior Liu is amazing.

283
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,100
Yes.

284
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,050
As expected of Senior Liu Shao.

285
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,620
My sister-in-law is amazing.

286
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,010
Keep your voice down.

287
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,740
What's the need of hiding it?

288
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,300
My sister-in-law is indeed amazing.

289
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,380
Even if my sister-in-law has become a disciple in the Immortal Palace,

290
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,620
she's still my sister-in-law.

291
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,300
Enough.

292
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,140
The Bone-Corroding Harp

293
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,950
seems to be calling someone.

294
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,900
Liu Shao.

295
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,620
Thank you for bringing the Bone-Corroding Harp to the Four Seasons Tablet.

296
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,140
Now, it's my turn.

297
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,140
This harp...

298
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,540
It's stealing my vitality.

299
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,740
No.

300
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:31,980
No.

301
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,060
Qiuxian.

302
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,820
Lingqi.

303
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,620
Steady the formation.

304
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,340
What's happening?

305
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,180
What's going on?

306
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,740
Stop!

307
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,020
Stop!

308
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,410
Immortal Master.

309
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,420
Look at the Four Seasons Tablet.

310
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,100
Immortal Master.

311
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,540
We can't suppress it.

312
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,500
What should we do?

313
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,420
I can't control the Bone-Corroding Harp.

314
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,340
What's wrong with Liu Shao?

315
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,980
Is she going to destroy the Four Seasons Tablet?

316
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,380
Liu Shao, what are you doing?

317
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,060
Do your best.

318
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,100
Don't let that devil come out.

319
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:27,940
Change the formation!

320
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,740
It seems that the Bone-Corroding Harp

321
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,020
is out of Liu Shao's control.

322
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,460
Liu Shao!

323
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,220
Liu Shao!

324
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,180
No!

325
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,700
A demon's attacking the Zijin Shield.

326
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,060
It's trying to break the protection spells.

327
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:53,940
Oh, no.

328
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,180
Sister-in-law is still up there.

329
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,780
Lay out the formation!

330
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,780
Disciples of Marquis Wuyang, listen up.

331
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,380
Protect the Four Seasons Tablet!

332
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,140
Yes.

333
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,410
Xie Lingqi.

334
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,380
Pay with your life for my son's death.

335
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,460
You overestimated yourself.

336
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,420
Let me see who else can stop me.

337
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,660
My Lord.

338
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,860
Marquis Wuyang.

339
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,340
My Lord.

340
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,460
Bone-Corroding Harp! No!

341
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,740
Soul-Devouring Spell?

342
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,540
Why would it break out at this moment?

343
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,780
Liu Shao, no.

344
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,140
I can't hold on anymore.

345
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,180
Liu Shao.

346
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,690
Is this what's called

347
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,580
having no choice...

348
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,900
Lu Li.

349
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,660
Did you see it clearly?

350
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,580
Your beloved one,

351
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,860
your friends,

352
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,060
and your fellows

353
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,260
are dying.

354
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,620
When the Soul-Devouring Spell is fully triggered,

355
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,140
you will die soon.

356
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
Are you satisfied?

357
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,780
Pick up the Moon Sword,

358
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,980
break the Four Seasons Tablet

359
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,380
and revive God of the Moonlight.

360
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,140
As long as you have the power of God,

361
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,260
all spirits in the Three Realms

362
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,490
will follow your order.

363
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,540
Everything

364
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,380
will be under your control.

365
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,620
Lu Li.

366
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,980
If you want to protect Liu Shao,

367
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,740
go and break the Four Seasons Tablet.

368
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,260
To break the Four Seasons Tablet

369
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,100
can get them saved.

370
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,620
Lu Li!

371
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,100
Protect the Four Seasons Tablet!

372
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,100
Once it's destroyed,

373
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,300
and the devil comes out,

374
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,410
the Three Realms will be in hell.

375
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,900
All spirits will suffer.

376
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,980
All spirits will suffer...

377
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,740
Everything will be in hell.

378
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,420
Break the Four Seasons Tablet

379
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,650
to get the power of God

380
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,660
so that you can truly protect them.

381
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,380
Lu Li.

382
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,020
What are you waiting for?

383
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,290
Lu Li.

384
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,860
Why are you hesitating?

385
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,220
Look at your dead fellows.

386
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,380
Your current power can't save anyone.

387
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,940
Get up!

388
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,340
Help them protect the Four Seasons Tablet!

389
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,810
Break the Four Seasons Tablet.

390
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,220
I won't break the Four Seasons Tablet.

391
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,300
To revive God of the Moonlight,

392
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,940
will make the Three Realms suffer.

393
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,420
I won't let that happen.

394
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,620
I won't!

395
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,660
Lu Li.

396
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,540
Don't disappoint me.

397
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,740
The future

398
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,060
is on you.

399
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,020
Ridiculous.

400
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
Let me see what you can do now.

401
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,940
Damn.

402
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,740
I've protected the world for my whole life.

403
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,220
Even if I have to sacrifice,

404
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,380
I won't allow you to tread on it.

405
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,820
My Lord!

406
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,620
My Lord!

407
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,380
No.

408
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,900
I can't be restrained by the Bone-Corroding Harp anymore.

409
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm the one who plays the Harp.

410
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,860
I am.

411
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:11,900
Liu Shao!

412
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,900
Liu Shao!

413
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,020
Liu Shao!

414
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,260
Lu Li!

415
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,980
Lu Li.

416
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,020
I wanted to heal my injury with Liu Shao's divine spirit.

417
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,860
But

418
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,220
you've come here to die first.

419
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,300
Lu Li!

420
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,180
Lu Li!

421
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,260
You humble mortals...

422
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,140
You only deserve to be my son's burial objects.

423
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,050
In the end,

424
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,140
I still can't

425
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,660
protect the ones I want to protect?

426
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,380
Lu Li.

427
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,050
Why should mortals die just because they're mortals?

428
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,860
Mortals also have things they want to defend,

429
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,940
and people they want to protect.

430
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,300
Lu Li.

431
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,300
The Moon Sword!

432
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,940
How can the Moon Sword regard a mortal as its master?

433
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,820
Do you remember what I said when we met?

434
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,780
Even if I'm not the most powerful one,

435
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,620
I dare to fight against everything,

436
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,140
no matter how strong or weak the opponent is.

437
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,860
No!

438
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,420
To be a God

439
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,850
by sacrificing my friends and my beloved one.

440
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,179
I won't do that.

441
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,780
I just want to be a mortal

442
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,300
to fight alongside them.

443
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,500
Impossible.

444
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:48,970
Xue.

445
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,860
How are you?

446
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,650
Are you okay?

447
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,540
Are you okay?

448
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,420
Are you really okay?

449
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,140
I'm fine.

450
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,180
Slow down.

451
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,180
Brother.

452
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,820
Brother!

453
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,020
Lu Li!

454
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,540
Brother.

455
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,220
Lu Li!

456
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,220
Brother!

457
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,860
Lu Li.

458
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,100
No.

459
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,620
Liu Shao.

460
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,900
I've promised you to be with you forever.

461
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,180
I...

462
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,980
I may be not able to make it.

463
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,780
No.

464
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,940
You've promised me.

465
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,220
You've promised me.

466
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,900
Don't lie to me.

467
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,060
I said

468
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,900
I would take care of you forever.

469
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,540
Unfortunately,

470
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,100
I still can't

471
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,380
protect you anymore.

472
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,500
I don't want you to protect me.

473
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,540
I only want you to be fine.

474
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,340
I just want you to be fine.

475
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,740
Your safety is more important than anything.

476
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,260
Promise me. Please.

477
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,180
-You must be fine. -Stop crying.

478
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,340
Don't cry.

479
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,980
Please.

480
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,020
Please.

481
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,420
We...

482
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,380
See you in the next life.

483
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,820
No.

484
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,620
We promised to be good.

485
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,180
We agreed to be together forever.

486
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,220
Lu Li, I beg you.

487
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,820
Don't leave me.

488
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,340
Please.

489
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,820
In this life,

490
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,340
I feel lucky to meet you.

491
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,180
Sorry for failing to be with you forever.

492
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,740
But I never regret meeting you.

00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,810
♫Appreciate with our hands tied♫

522
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:41,670
♫Thousands of paths with flowers♫

523
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,180
But

524
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,140
when everyone suspected me,

525
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,340
only you would trust me and help me.

526
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,300
30,000 taels?

527
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,380
Awesome!

528
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,710
♫Ask the flowing water whether it knows the red leaves♫

529
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,620
Then I...

530
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,290
♫I miss you so much♫

531
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,940
I'll ask Lord to be the matchmaker after we go back.

532
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,740
Maybe there will be a lucky day for us

533
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,940
to get married this year.

534
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,770
♫I still remember the youth♫

535
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,020
Liu Shao!

536
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,870
♫I laughed and hated getting old♫

537
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,260
-Lu Li! -Liu Shao!

538
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,300
Lu Li!

539
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,110
♫Flowers bloom alone. The fragrance fills the path♫

540
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,050
♫Look at the stars from faraway♫

541
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,720
♫The chaos of knowing love♫

542
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,540
♫The South Wind folds a little red♫

543
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,260
Then set a time limit.

544
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,500
Make it last...

545
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,010
♫Send you to the Western State♫

546
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,500
to the moment when I can't protect my beloved one,

547
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,910
♫Wild geese pass the mountains and the sea♫

548
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,340
no more needed by anyone,

549
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,980
and come to the end of my life.

550
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,210
♫I am rushing to a dream♫

551
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,180
Lu Li.

552
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,440
♫The fate of three lifetimes♫

553
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,460
♫Appreciate with our hands tied♫

554
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,320
♫Thousands of paths with flowers♫

555
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,500
I was born with only half a heart.

556
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,620
Now,

557
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,610
I've found the other half.

558
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,540
It's you.

559
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,330
Liar!

560
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,860
Let's catch the moon!

561
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,100
Don't miss it.

562
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,100
Miss.

563
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,820
Miss.

564
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,620
I said it's true, but you don't believe me.

565
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,020
I've been here before.

566
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,250
The immortal brought me here.

567
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,220
Miss.

568
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,980
Miss, slow down.

569
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:21,980
Miss.

570
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,340
So cute.

571
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,380
When I find my immortal,

572
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,660
I will ask him to take me to see

573
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,140
mountains, the sun, the moon, and stars everywhere.

574
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,260
To catch the moon!

575
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,930
Don't miss it.

576
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,100
Let's catch the moon.

577
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,140
I've once thought about

578
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,360
whether the promise

579
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,540
was just a dream or not.

580
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,460
Because I can't remember his face.

581
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,400
If you leave your fate in my hands,

582
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,170
I can play with you for three days.

583
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,770
We can go to

584
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,280
the most interesting

585
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,720
and funnest places all over the world.

586
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,070
But if I don't believe in myself,

587
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,710
then the three days

588
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,850
can only be a dream.

589
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,580
Only by believing it

590
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:18,850
can the promise

591
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,410
be real.

592
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,000
Immortal?
