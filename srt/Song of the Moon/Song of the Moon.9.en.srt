[Episode 09]

4
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,180
How can we make this tree,

5
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,470
which has been dead for 10,000 years,

6
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,550
bloom in five days?

7
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,990
Should we first figure out

8
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,789
how this tree died?

9
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,000
This tree was originally planted by

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,760
our Demon King and Demon Queen.

11
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,790
They nourished the tree with their love.

12
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,080
There were thousands of Water Hyacinths

13
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,150
blooming on this tree at that time,

14
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,880
which was very spectacular.

15
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,110
Water Hyacinth?

16
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,410
Is it the flower

17
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,270
engraved on your flute?

18
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:17,950
Yep.

19
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,710
Since then,

20
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,380
Water Hyacinths

21
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,270
have become the mark of our Melody race.

22
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,670
The one engraved on my flute

23
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,480
is just a simple pattern.

24
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,790
The real Water Hyacinth

25
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,040
has the same blue-purple color

26
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,230
as the one on my clothes.

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,390
Then

28
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,240
why did this tree die?

29
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,990
Later, the Demon King and Demon Queen turned against each other.

30
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,720
And the Demon Queen committed suicide and died.

31
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,220
The tree has gradually withered

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,240
since then,

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,760
and those Water Hyacinths have never appeared again.

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,590
The Demon King and Demon Queen turned against each other.

35
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,870
Why would that happen?

36
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,829
It's a long story.

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,710
I'll start with their encounter.

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,150
Thousands of years ago,

39
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,430
the Demon King disguised this place as a residence of the immortals.

40
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,950
And he disguised himself as a lake fairy to pursue Immortal Ze Shui.

41
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,630
A demon and a fairy

42
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,270
have fallen in love

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,590
ever since.

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,760
And they planted the Brahma tree together.

45
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,630
Immortal Ze Shui often played Bone-Corroding Harp under the tree

46
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,550
to help the tree grow.

47
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,070
The sapling, irrigated by her love

48
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,710
and energized by her magic,

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,120
sprouted in three days,

50
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,630
grew into a tree in seven,

51
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,910
and blossomed in ten.

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,950
Wasn't Immortal Ze Shui

53
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,230
the sister of the God of the Moonlight?

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,310
A love that begined with deception like this

55
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,790
would surely cause problems later, right?

56
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,280
You're right.

57
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,670
Immortal Ze Shui found out the truth.

58
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,710
Then they had a dispute.

59
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,510
Ze Shui tried to leave.

60
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,230
But the Demon King sealed her divine spirit and imprisoned her.

61
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,150
And all those eventually led to her death.

62
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,390
After that, the God of the Moonlight cursed our Melody race

63
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,760
after discovering the tragic death of Immortal Ze Shui.

64
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,040
Since then,

65
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,560
we have never been able to leave the water.

66
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,630
And the Brahma tree withered

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,960
and died.

68
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,279
But,

69
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,950
since they loved each other, why couldn't they be together?

70
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,110

71
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,240

You've only had one glass of rouge wine,

73

how come you're already drunk?

74
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,470
I'm going to get him some sober medicine.

75
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,400
I'll go with you.

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,710
Don't go.

77

Then... I'll just stay here.

80

Don't look at him. Look at me.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,950
Why can't I look at him?

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,630
My heart hurts

83
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,030
if you look at him.

84
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,150
It hurts so much.

85
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,120
It's more painful than being poisoned.

86
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,520
Does it hurt?

87
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,350
Does it hurt?

88
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,630
Are you drunk or have you become stupid?

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,600
Neither.

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,790
But my heart tells me

91
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,480
that I want to be like this

92
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,310
for the rest of my life.

93

But...

94
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,790
a lifetime is so long.

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,750
What if I can't afford your salary?

96
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,110

One tael of silver?

100

Do you think it's expensive?

Deal.

104

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,590
and was nourished by love.

174
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,430
It had also perceived the hate between lovers

175
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,750
and died because of it.

178
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,670

00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,350
what you said last night?

182

You don't remember?

183

This...

184

You still don't remember?

185
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,340
Did you not mean what you said

186
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,870
when you were drunk?

Of course I remember.

For one copper coin,

192
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,350
I sold myself to you,

193

194

No regrets ever.

This is the only female flower in the tree.

Mr. Tai made this flower into the antidote.

204

why didn't you tell Liu Shao

224

that so-called pendant

225
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,990
was made by a lot of demon energy.

226

If I told her about that,

227

I would definitely expect something in return.

I wonder what magic they used.

They disappeared as soon as they came out.

They could only go to the Mansion anyway.

I'm not good at anything else,

please forgive me.

Take him to the cell.

I'll interrogate him myself.

Please spare me this time.

You said

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,080
you treated me as your own son.

really doing a great job.

-So funny. -Brother.

00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,270
Don't you think

374
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,350
you should treat me to a roast leg of lamb?

375
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,090
It's in your nature to be stupid.

376
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,950
You don't have to act at all.

377
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,230
Those lines were so long.

Come on.

379
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
You forgot all the lines in the middle.

380

It was me who reminded you.

-There's one more person. -What I did with the script...

382

was so good.

Alright.

Wait.

388

What are you in such a hurry for?

389
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,120
I heard that the Lord is awake.

390
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,220
Lu Li and Liu Shao's suspicions were cleared.

391

They are back now.

What?

393
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,750
That's great.

394
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,490
I bet you must think

395
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,430
that I have already been tortured

396
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,030
to death, right?

397
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,560
I will avenge myself.

Let's have a fair battle.

399
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,230
You're asking for death?

400
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,630
Considering what you've done,

401
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,390
I should be crueler to you.

For Lu Li's sake

This is the last time I will call you that.

because of an outsider?

414
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,030
First,

415
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,790
Liu Shao is not an outsider.

416
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,670
She is someone I care about.

Second,

418
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,080
I'm doing this because you've gone mad.

You are no longer the senior I knew.

Third,

were you involved in the poisoning of Marquis Wuyang or not?

Did Bai Feng instigate you to do it?

My Lord,

431
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,190
I was wrong.

432
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,030
I shouldn't have listened to Bai Feng's instigation.

433

She gave me the poison.

434
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,070

Is it true?

Can Senior Du be exempt from punishment

by saying that?

444

Then take it as my own idea.

What else do you want me to do?

474
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,760
It's a serious crime

I will spare your life

494

I am not capable of doing so.

If it was Lu Li now,

501

no matter what would happen.

503

But you don't

504
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,310
even have the courage to fight me.

505

519
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,470
Du Mingchong

520
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,750
colluded with demons

521
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,080
and did these vicious things.

522
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,870
Therefore, I will abolish his cultivation

523
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,070
and

524
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,960
expel him.

525
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,550
From now on,

526
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,230
he is no longer a member

527
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,830
here.

528
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,680
Yes.

529
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,790
Senior Du.

530
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,150
My Lord,

531
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,070
what about Bai Feng?

532
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,290
She lost her mind

533
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,130
and did wrong things.

534
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,900
At this moment,

535
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,250
she should have realized her mistake.

536
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,220
Take her back to Lingxi Yard

537
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,100
and ground her for a month.

538
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,130
Then demote her to an ordinary disciple.

539
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,199
You're moving out tomorrow?

540
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,170
I'll be lonely.

541
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,770
Do you still think you are our senior?

542
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,739
From now on,

543
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,710
it will be Liu Shao's room.

544
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,770
Quickly pick up your things and follow me.

545
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,800
You shouldn't have done this.

546
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:28,690
Let's go.

547
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,199
Liu Shao.

548
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,040
Let's just wait and see.

549
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,020
The Moon Sword

550
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,460
has been silent in the human world for thousands of years.

551
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,100
No matter how hard people tried,

552
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,920
no one could pull out this sword.

553
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,020
You can refine the remaining King Herb

554
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,360
to prolong your lifespan,

555
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,590
and continue to train disciples and select talents.

556
00:34:59,470 --> 00:34:59,930
Fang Zhan,

557
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,820
do you know the reason why

558
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,640
I want the King Herb?

559
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,180
Live forever and protect the world forever.

560
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,450
No.

561
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,640
It's because

562
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,750
I'm also afraid of death.

563
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,620
But I've figured it out now.

564
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,960
Using King Herb

565
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,940
to bring a hope to the human world

566
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,850
is better than keeping myself alive for another ten years.

567
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,200
The Moon Sword

568
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,260
was once the weapon of God of the Moonlight.

569
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,950
I heard that it can split mountains, cut off the sea

570
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,420
and kill all demons.

571
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,500
If any of my disciples pulls out this sword,

572
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,770
it will definitely be a blessing

573
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,990
to all living beings in the human world.

574
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,020
Let all the disciples

575
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,540
gather in front of the Moon Stone tomorrow.

576
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,320
We will start the ultimate trial.

577
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,330
I

578
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,570
will choose an heir myself.

579
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,180
[Lingyun Residence]

580
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,840
The left side?

581
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,070
This is the left side.

582
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,250
The left side.

583
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,570
The right side is better.

584
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,260
Xue will like the pattern

585
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,940
and the color.

586
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,160
That's it.

587
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,960
Are you sure?

588
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,550
Yes.

589
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,220
I'm sure.

590
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,960
I'm so tired.

591
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:50,810
My...

592
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,120
All right.

593
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,120
This side.

594
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,200
Okay, this side.

595
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,330
And that side.

596
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,270
Are you feeling better?

597
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,210
The guards hired by others are just to help them fight.

598
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,720
Not only do I have to buy you sheets as your guard,

599
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,980
but I also have to deliver them to you.

600
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,660
If I had known earlier,

601
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,750
I would not have given you the recording stone.

602
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,870
I have given you a massage.

603
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,830
Why are you still saying this?

604
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,180
You still have to help me with the sheets.

605
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,160
Miss Liu,

606
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,060
don't you think you are too greedy?

607
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,570
I...

608
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,580
Are you sure you don't want to see your bill?

609
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,840
You owe me a lot.

610
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,510
Really?

611
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,010
Then,

612
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,570
can I refuse to pay?

613
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,850
You can't do that.

614
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,300
Just tell me if it's okay.

615
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,560
How can I say no?

616
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,570
Lu Li,

617
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,220
when we pull out the Moon Sword

618
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,230
and defeat Ao Hen,

619
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,170
remember to ask your master to come to my house to propose marriage.

620
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,300
I warned you not to fall in love with Liu Shao.

621
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,370
What you're doing is not good for either of you.

622
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,730
Lu Li,

623
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,490
my suppression of Soul-Devouring Spell is only temporarily effective.

624
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,620
If you are seriously injured,

625
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,400
or the caster activates the spell to break through my suppression,

626
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,790
the backlash will make you die faster.

627
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,140
Hey.

628
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,570
You are not willing to do that?

629
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,390
How is that possible?

630
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,900
First of all,

631
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,380
we have to pull out

632
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,810
the Moon Sword that no one could pull out, right?

633
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,090
Tomorrow is the ultimate trial.

634
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,030
Just wait and see how skilled I am.

635
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,170
I once said

636
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,890
that I would reward those

637
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,610
who retrieve the immortal grass.

638
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,670
Today,

639
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,560
I will give you the opportunity

640
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,400
of this ultimate trial.

641
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,460
Liu Shao, Lu Li.

642
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,040
Are you ready?

643
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,390
-Yes. -I'm ready.

644
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,530
The person who passes the ultimate trial

645
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,970
will not only become my heir,

646
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,820
but also be possible to pull out the Moon Sword

647
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,590
and become its master.

648
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,350
Let's begin.

649
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:40,790
Go in.

650
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,090
It seems that the trial at the Moon Stone has begun.

651
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,140
What's wrong, brother?

652
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,160
Are you still thinking about that Immortal Ze Shui?

653
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,440
She is not Immortal Ze Shui.

654
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,850
Since she's not,

655
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,250
why can't you forget about her?

656
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,520
You even

657
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,260
gave her a pendant,

658
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,920
and promised to help her at any time.

659
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:07,940
Fu,

660
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,290
stop spying on my whereabouts.

661
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,300
You may not know it,

662
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,330
but the ultimate trial of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

663
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,220
is very occult.

664
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,470
It's said

665
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,200
that as long as you take a wrong step in the illusion of Moon Stone,

666
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,220
you will never be able to come out again.

667
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,950
Do you think your little fairy

668
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,840
will have a chance to get out?

669
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,530
Liu Shao?

670
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,920
Liu Shao?
