4
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,460
Brother.

5
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,140
Don't leave me.

6
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,540
I've sent your stuff

7
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,260
to the Waterside Pavilion for Reflections.

8
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,060
Can you tell me the answer now?

9
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,940
Who killed my master?

10
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,370
Liu Shao and Immortal Luo Ge.

11
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,579
Impossible.

12
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,180
Do you want me to remind you about

13
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,100
what happened on Luositai?

14
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,500
Your master Lu Sheng was also involved.

15
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,460
So you hate them too, right?

16
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,780
Don't worry.

17
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,260
I won't let them know

18
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,020
there is demon energy in your body.

19
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,820
You just need to come here once every two days.

20
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,700
After all, the enemy of my enemy

21
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,100
is my friend.

22
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,460
What are these?

23
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,060
These are the Weiyang flowers from yesterday.

24
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,340
I tried to use magic

25
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,170
to make a few.

26
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,980
What do you think?

27
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,820
Are they beautiful?

28
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,500
Weiyang flowers will never wither.

29
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,090
They symbolize that lovers will hold hands and be together forever.

30
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,210
Can I

31
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,500
put them here?

32
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,700
Please.

33
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,900
Whatever.

34
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,380
Aren't you going to teach me magic?

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
You can train your temperament

36
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,820
with the Great Tone and Six Senses Symphony I gave you last time.

37
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,260
But before that,

38
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,020
I need to break through your Qihai first.

39
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,780
Qihai?

40
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,220
The vitality cultivated in the mortal world

41
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,820
is no different from

42
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,060
the spiritual power of the Immortal Palace.

43
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,220
I'll break through the Qihai for you

44
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,060
and guide the congested breath to form the spiritual flow.

45
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,660
Then you can practice the magic of the Immortal Palace.

46
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,580
Immortal.

47
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,050
Are you okay?

48
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,420
I'm fine.

49
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,820
The bracelet

50
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,660
removed some of the strength for you

51
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,450
and protected you

52
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,260
and me.

53
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,180
But it was smashed into pieces.

54
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,060
It's my fault.

55
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,540
I broke the treasure

56
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,180
Lu Li left you.

57
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,659
I'll make it up to you later.

58
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,380
As long as you're still here,

59
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,090
everything else

60
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,100
are just worldly possessions.

61
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,180
The power of the Sun in your body

62
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,700
is indeed special.

63
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,500
I need to think about it carefully.

64
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,900
The next few days,

65
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,940
I have to be in seclusion.

66
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,620
Go back and rest.

67
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,740
What is this?

68
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,180
Little Fairy Luo Ning.

69
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,140
Although it's one day late,

70
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,740
I still want to wish you a happy birthday.

71
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,820
I am

72
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,740
a smart man.

73
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,940
You look

74
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,420
ok.

75
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,220
But you're still

76
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,260
less handsome than my brother.

77
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,020
But you are

78
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,060
a little thin.

79
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,460
You flatter me.

80
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,900
You are quite thick-skinned.

81
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,180
However,

82
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,700
this is a merit,

83
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,250
which is better than my brother.

84
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,980
All right.

85
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,130
Now,

86
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,450
tell me.

87
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,780
You tried so hard

88
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,340
to send yourself to me.

89
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,300
What's your intention?

90
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm just a prisoner.

91
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,370
Although my body

92
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
came to you

93
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,340
through the water energy,

94
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,580
my spirit is still locked up.

95
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,900
My body is at the mercy of you.

96
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,180
What bad intention can I have?

97
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,250
So well said.

98
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,700
For example,

99
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,420
you can ask about the Immortal Palace

100
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,140
and see if my brother

101
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,380
has any weaknesses.

102
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,220
And can I,

103
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,380
a little fairy

104
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,420
who never goes out

105
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,210
and knows nothing about the world,

106
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,090
be of any use to you?

107
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,660
Right?

108
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,700
You think too much.

109
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,809
Look.

110
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,690
I just felt lonely locked in the Waterside Pavillion,

111
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,460
and wanted to play with someone.

112
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,179
I like this reason.

113
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,900
How about

114
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,530
we play a game

115
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,620
and see how long

116
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,700
this water energy can sustain you?

117
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,570
You're indeed thin.

118
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,020
What?

119
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,580
Immortal haven't recovered yet?

120
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,820
I don't think he hasn't recovered from his old injury.

121
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,700
But there is some problem with his cultivation.

122
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,220
Look.

123
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
He can't get rid of

124
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,650
the poison from the Brahma Lotus.

125
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,620
The sword wound hasn't recovered yet.

126
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,500
He even injured himself when he helped me break through Qihai.

127
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,500
He said he was fine.

128
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:27,900
However,

129
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,300
I think not only is he not okay,

130
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,370
but his condition is also serious.

131
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,380
It seems that after he became an Immortal,

132
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,880
there seems to be something wrong with his cultivation.

133
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,940
Is there something wrong with experiencing the tribulations?

134
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,580
His energy and meridians were damaged.

135
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,440
Is it because of Lu Li's half heart?

136
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,820
I'm not sure.

137
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,220
In fact, in these ten thousand years,

138
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,660
there were only four or five Immortals.

139
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,900
They all didn't live very long.

140
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,460
Immortal Shang,

141
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,580
Shang Yurong's father,

142
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,540
was only an Immortal for 200 years.

143
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,140
Then he died

144
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,770
and never returned.

145
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,090
This...

146
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,740
Why are you running?

147
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,420
I'm not going to do anything to you.

148
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,380
Master Shang, how long have you been here?

149
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,060
I've been sleeping on the tree.

150
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,940
I didn't move.

151
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,260
Don't worry.

152
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,300
I

153
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,780
was hurt by

154
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,860
the magic weapon of Lu Sheng, the half demon.

155
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,860
Later, when rebuilding the Protection Spell of the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke,

156
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,980
I exhausted my spiritual power.

157
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,700
That's why my injury recurred.

158
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,740
I saw everything just now.

159
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,740
The divine spirit in Liu Shao's body

160
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,980
belongs to God of the Sun,

161
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
which is extremely yang in nature.

162
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,700
The power in your body

163
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,380
belongs to God of the Moonlight, which is extremely yin in nature.

164
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,700
You two

165
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,580
are born mutually destructive.

166
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,540
That's why you haven't recovered yet

167
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,420
and are wearing out gradually.

168
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,260
That's the real reason.

169
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,460
With her ability,

170
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,660
even if she has the power of the Sun,

171
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
she can't hurt you.

172
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,820
Are you afraid of hurting her?

173
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,650
If you hadn't risked your life

174
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,220
and retrieved your power,

175
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,100
do you know what would've happened to her?

176
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,780
Even with the lake beads protecting her,

177
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,300
she will

178
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,180
turn into broken bits.

179
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,420
Why are you so nervous?

180
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,060
Nothing.

181
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,530
Are you still worried

182
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,230
Luo Ge can't recover soon?

183
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,550
He's an Immortal. He'll be fine.

184
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,460
But if something happens to Luo Ge,

185
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,610
you'll help him, right?

186
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,610
That's right.

187
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,890
But,

188
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,780
can you give it back to me?

189
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,540
This is my senior's favorite flower.

190
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,950
Only one bloomed this year.

191
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,180
I have to show it to her.

192
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:22,970
Okay.

193
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,580
Here.

194
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,780
I won't ask you for it for nothing.

195
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,940
This hairpin is

196
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,660
my thank-you gift.

197
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,980
What are you doing?

198
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,460
Senior.

199
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,860
Hairpin.

200
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:37,940
Senior.

201
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,380
Senior.

202
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,500
Look at this flower. Is it beautiful?

203
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,540
You are the master of the palace.

204
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,620
Why are you playing with plants

205
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,180
instead of cultivating?

206
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,220
What are you thinking?

207
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,540
Please spare my life.

208
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:50,940
Stop!

209
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,660
Stop!

210
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,680
Senior, I was wrong.

211
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,780
Stop!

212
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,500
Please spare my life.

213
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Master Zhuo is so amazing.

214
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,780
I have to return this hairpin to him.

215
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,020
Not bad.

216
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,500
Two hours have passed.

217
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,820
Without the water energy,

218
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,890
you have been holding on for a long time.

219
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,450
You...

220
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
What's wrong

221
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,940
with your face?

222
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,740
You have a thorough research on demons.

223
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,820
Don't you know that although I can stay out of water,

224
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,060
but I can't hold on for more than two hours?

225
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,350
Yes.

226
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,260
That seems to be the case.

227
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,210
I've been

229
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,060
studying recently.

230
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,770
I now have a bad memory.

231
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,860
You...

232
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,900
What's wrong?

233
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,770
I don't look decent.

234
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,940
Fairy.

235
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,900
Excuse me.

236
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,340
Hello?

237
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,860
Hello?

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,420
Although Fu

239
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,380
is not a good person,

240
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
he is

241
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,770
quite interesting.

242
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Master,

243
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,180
is this a medical book or a ghost painting?

244
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,300
I don't know a word.

245
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,900
My dear,

246
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,180
this is the only copy left.

247
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,580
I'll forgive you for being ignorant,

248
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,180
but don't insult the words from my ancestors.

249
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,860
Then you should keep

250
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,220
the stuff from your ancestors for yourself.

251
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,100
Why are you showing it to me? I don't understand.

252
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,700
This ancient scroll records that

253
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,260
Weirui Grass can help Immortal regain his vitality.

254
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,260
Weirui Grass?

255
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,780
It can bring infinite vitality to the body.

256
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,060
When Luo Ge ascended,

257
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,580
he needed to break through a lot of obstacles.

258
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,340
There are some remaining problems.

259
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,660
It can remould Luo Ge

260
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
and let him feel reborn.

261
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,460
Is it hard to find this grass?

262
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,180
It's very hard to find.

263
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,660
You may not be able to see it once in ten thousand years.

264
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,020
But I'm the once-in-ten-thousand-years master.

265
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,380
I have a seed of it.

266
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,040
Really?

267
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,300
Please don't tell me

268
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,500
even there is seed, but you can't grow it?

269
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,380
Actually,

270
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,900
as long as someone can nurture it with

271
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,290
the mediated extreme yin and yang energies,

272
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,460
it will grow out in three days.

273
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,500
But who can

274
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,820
mediate the extreme yin and yang energies?

275
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,140
Well...

276
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,100
I know. I don't know.

277
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,140
I know not.

278
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,660
Master,

279
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,700
you should throw the ancient book

280
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,220
into the water.

281
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,740
I thought the problem can be solved.

282
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,900
There will be a way.

283
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,980
Miss Liu Shao.

284
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,220
Immortal Luo Ge summons you.

285
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,980
Coming.

286
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,580
What is this?

287
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,940
This is the Ice Spirit.

288
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,020
It can help you break through Qihai

289
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,940
and become an Immortal.

290
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,060
Ice Spirit.

291
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,420
The spirit of ice

292
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,290
comes from the softest water,

293
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,540
and draws from the extreme yin energy.

294
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,020
This mantra of heart

295
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,460
is teaching me to mediate the extreme yang energy of the Sun

296
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,620
with the extreme yin power.

297
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,260
Could the spiritual energy cultivated with this mantra of heart

298
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,340
the harmonious qi of yin and yang

299
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,100
that Wan Sui mentioned?

300
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,020
This mantra of heart is good.

301
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,860
I will practice hard.

302
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Before that,

303
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,900
drink this first.

304
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,220
Is this a good thing for cultivating spiritual power?

305
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,460
No need.

306
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,819
I'm very healthy.

307
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,060
You should keep such a good thing

308
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,020
for yourself.

309
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,060
This is Phoenix Tears.

310
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,619
It's left by God of the Sun.

311
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,540
What is it?

312
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,290
After the phoenix's nirvana,

313
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,780
it was reborn from fire.

314
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,540
Before nirvana,

315
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,540
it wept at the thought of the past.

316
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,140
But from then on,

317
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,340
a new life begins.

318
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,980
So Phoenix Tears can help you forget the past.

319
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,460
It can make you forget

320
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,660
people and things related to love.

321
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,900
From now on,

322
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,780
your cultivation will be much easier.

323
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,500
Didn't you say

324
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,740
even the mind-clearing power of Xuan Ling Wood

325
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,660
can't erase

326
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,980
people's love?

327
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,500
Xuan Ling Wood can only clear distracting thoughts.

328
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,300
Phoenix Tears

329
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,340
can make you forget all love related feelings.

330
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,580
It's like a glass of water.

331
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,340
If you got dust on it,

332
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,060
Xuan Ling Wood only clears dust.

333
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
The Phoenix Tears

334
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,700
will pour out the whole cup of water.

335
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,820
So,

336
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,620
you want me to forget Lu Li

337
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,180
and everything that happened before?

338
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,570
Now that you don't remember,

339
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,300
you want me to forget too?

340
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,500
Just pretend it never happened?

341
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,020
Mortal love will only disturb your cultivation, Liu Shao.

342
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,060
It's better to forget.

343
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,180
But I don't want to cultivate.

344
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,780
I just want to be with you.

345
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,380
This is the obsession you shouldn't have.

346
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,620
You should have forgotten it.

347
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,540
I...

348
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,020
What happened between Lu Li and me

349
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,260
were real.

350
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,060
It's not dust,

351
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,060
nor water that has been stained.

352
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Even if you're now Immortal Luo Ge,

353
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,260
it doesn't change anything.

354
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,140
I, Liu Shao,

355
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,900
would rather die than forget.

356
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,020
How dare you!

357
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,540
Liu Shao.

358
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,580
Liu Shao.

359
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,220
Luo Ge.

360
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,370
I won't forget.

361
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,820
Never.

362
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,660
It's OK if you don't want to forget.

363
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,620
Leave the Immortal Palace.

364
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,740
Leave Xiyin Mountain

365
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,550
and return to your mortal world.

366
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,620
No.

367
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,970
You just forgot the past.

368
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,740
You didn't forget

369
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,180
our relationship, right?

370
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,660
I can feel

371
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,420
your heart

372
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,940
still belongs to Lu Li.

373
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,140
It has never changed.

374
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,700
I won't be wrong.

375
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,820
You're wrong.

376
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,980
I'm devoted to cultivation.

377
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,380
I don't have Lu Li's feelings.

378
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,720
♫On rainy days, wind blows smoke♫

379
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,500
You do.

380
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,580
I heard Lu Li was attacked by the Soul-devouring Spell.

♫Into circles♫

382
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,980
It wasn't undone until death.

383
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,460
Do I have it?

384
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,800
♫On both sides, I'm chanting♫

♫Is like the things we went through♫

♫Can compare with the rest of my life♫

405

Do you want to harm others and yourself

406

and make the three worlds hopeless?

407
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,100
The spiritual powers are against each other.

408
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,670
♫I look at my love and send it to the clouds outside the garden♫

409

No.

♫Looking at your ageless face at the end of the world♫

Will the spiritual powers still oppose each other?

413

Can't you see that his injuries are difficult to heal

414

♫You put the winter snow in your ears and can’t hear it♫

416

♫When the flowers stop falling, you and I will miss each other♫

It's better for you to forget everything.

423

Please

451

allow me to stay in the Immortal Palace

Okay.

455

You can stay in the Immortal Palace,

Shut up.

515
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,050
I'm not doing this for you.

516
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,420
It's for the Immortal Palace.

517
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,060
Liu Shao.

518
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,050
Are you okay?

519
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,180
What?

520
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,780
Do you want to stay to take care

521
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,500
or take her back to serve her?

522
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,980
I dare not.

523
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,500
I'm going to find the Master now.

524
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,500
He knows medicine.

525
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,900
You look disappointed.

526
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,780
A little.

527
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,940
After all,

528
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,690
I don't want to see you die.

529
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,300
You are honest.

530
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,620
You're not pretentious at all.

531
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,020
I like it.

532
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,930
There are so many people who like me.

533
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,900
I don't need you anymore.

534
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,140
At least I can wait for your brother with you.

535
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,610
I don't need you to wait with me.

536
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,220
If I want to see him, I can see him anytime.

537
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,900
Although he loves you,

538
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,130
he doesn't belong to you.

539
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,980
He belongs to the Immortal Palace.

540
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,170
He belongs to the three worlds.

541
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,020
Only this little

542
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,340
belongs to you.

543
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,460
You wonder if I understand you, right?

544
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,860
When I came here last time,

545
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,420
you seems to be good at craftsmanship.

546
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,420
So I brought a craft with me.

547
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,540
Don't give this ugly doll

548
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,380
to me.

549
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
This will ruin

550
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,690
the feng shui of the Waterside Pavilion.

551
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,820
I'm a prisoner.

552
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,940
I have nothing.

553
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,260
This doll

554
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,740
is made from my clothes.

555
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,450
It means everything

556
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,700
came from me.

557
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,270
Then...

558
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,300
That makes me want it even less.

559
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,260
In the past,

560
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,740
I made an uglier one for my brother.

561
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,620
He fought other clans

562
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,020
on behalf of our clan.

563
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,980
He left for three months.

564
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,860
But when he came back,

565
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,900
I found that he lost the doll I made.

566
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,340
I was furious and unreasonable.

567
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,820
I smashed everything I could break in his chamber.

568
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,100
I even bit him.

569
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,380
You're

570
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,300
not good at making things.

571
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,820
Well,

572
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,100
it is quite interesting.

573
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,020
Is it?

574
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,900
Normally,

575
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,140
people would say I'm immature.

576
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,300
Since brothers are already so sensible,

577
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,220
why should we be sensible?

578
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,980
Why can't such a good brother

579
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,010
only belong to me?

580
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
Why should I share him with the whole clan?

581
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,220
That makes sense.

582
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,660
Why should my brother belong to the Immortal Palace?

583
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,930
Why should my brother belong to the three worlds?

584
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,300
Your story

585
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,060
is quite nice.

586
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,020
But

587
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,580
this doll is really ugly.

588
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,820
Fu.

589
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,060
You tried so hard

590
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,020
to please me with my brother.

591
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,460
You're really full of schemes.

592
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,820
If it can relieve loneliness,

593
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,750
so what?

594
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,780
You're right.

595
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,130
How about I be your brother?

596
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm about

597
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,820
1,000 years old this year.

598
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,300
General of Water,

599
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,860
how old are you?

600
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,900
I'm almost 1,000 years old.

601
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,210
Almost 1,000 years old?

602
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,450
That means you're not 1,000 years old.

603
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,180
Call me older sister.

604
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,740
Older sister.

605
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,140
I still think

606
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,700
the title Little Fairy suits you better.

607
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,660
Little Fairy?

608
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,020
Alright then.

609
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,420
I...

610
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,140
I'll call you Fu.

611
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,300
OK.

612
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,660
Fu.

613
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,460
You want to lie to me

614
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,020
and you want to be my brother,

615
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,260
then you must

616
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,180
agree with me in everything, right?

617
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,340
Well, you may put it this way.

618
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,900
You went out fine,

619
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,780
why did you come back like this?

620
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,380
No.

621
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,660
Where else can you go?

622
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,980
You don't even have a place to stay now.

623
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,700
Yes.

624
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,700
I've been chasing

625
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,380
and chasing.

626
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,940
I just want to be happy with him

627
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,660
and want us to be an ordinary couple.

628
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,370
Even if we can't be a couple,

629
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,090
as long as we can see each other

630
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,210
and accompany each other in the Immortal Palace,

631
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,500
I would still feel happy.

632
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,250
But

633
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,620
it was impossible

634
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,220
from the beginning.

635
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
It was a wild wish

636
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,500
from the beginning.

637
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,100
I thought you and Lu Li would never be separated.

638
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,660
Why were you separated again and again?

639
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,260
They said

640
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,660
our spiritual powers oppose each other.

641
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,500
If we stay together,

642
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,940
it will hurt him.

643
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,860
Don't listen to them.

644
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,420
The herbs that oppose each other

645
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,740
grow good together.

646
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,020
I don't know.

647
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,300
But

648
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,740
as long as Luo Ge is fine,

649
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,700
I can do anything.

650
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,020
Master,

651
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,740
can you give me the seed of Weirui Grass?

652
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,740
What do you want it for?

653
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,540
I want Luo Ge to be well.

654
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,050
Master.

655
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,140
This demon energy is made from

656
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,340
an Aquatic Demon baby born less than an hour.

657
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,060
If Master uses this,

658
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,180
your power will progress by leaps and bounds.

659
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,100
Who allowed you to touch the Aquatic Demons?

660
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,460
Do you want to die?

661
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,150
The Demon King in White is here.

662
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,450
Listen up, demons!

663
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,260
For hundreds of years,

664
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,540
we demons have been unorganized

665
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,220
and fought against each other.

666
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,740
We were despised in the three worlds.

667
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,900
Today,

668
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,140
I swear

669
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,980
to change everything.

670
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,300
From now on,

671
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,180
as long as you are a demon,

672
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,300
as long as you're in the territory of demons,

673
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,940
you have to treat me, He Na in white, as the king.

674
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,340
You have to follow my orders

675
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,140
for everything you say and do.

676
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,930
If you have a second opinion,

677
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,900
come forward.

678
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,860
Greetings, Demon King He Na.

679
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,420
We will be loyal

680
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,780
and follow you.

681
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,780
One more thing.

682
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,860
Remember.

683
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,900
My first rule is

684
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,699
those who kill children,

685
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,060
regardless of race or whether an enemy or a friend,

686
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,580
will be killed.

687
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

688
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,340
[Meditation Spell]

689
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:39,980
Meditation Spell?

690
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,940
My brother

691
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,020
has cast a spell on these books.

692
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,739
These words will only disappear

693
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,020
after people recite and memorise

694
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,380
all the contents in the book.

695
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,900
You like me so much.

696
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,659
You should be willing to

697
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,890
help me finish my homework this month.

698
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,900
What?

699
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,900
You don't want to?

700
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,660
I will do it.

701
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,220
Of course I'm willing to help you.

702
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,020
I just want to ask you.

703
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,500
How many days are left

704
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,660
in this month?

705
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,940
Good boy.

706
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,820
Recite it carefully. Do you hear me?

707
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,020
Yes.

708
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,020
Not bad.

709
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,980
Fu

710
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,780
is really a material.

711
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,700
My homework for next month is coming.

712
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,700
I

713
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,900
need such a talent.

714
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,900
This is ugly.

715
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,690
But...

716
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,780
he has finished

717
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,020
all your homework.

718
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,300
That's a lot.

719
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,130
But

720
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,980
it's still ugly.

721
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,700
Much better now.

722
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,540
It seems that

723
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,940
Fu had a good time

724
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,300
with Fairy Luo Ning.

725
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,500
Have you found

726
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,180
what I asked you to find?

727
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,370
I've checked all the things

728
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,580
Master left.

729
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,100
There is no formation

730
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,260
that can break the barrier set by the Immortal.

731
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,180
As I expected,

732
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,300
I have to take the risk now.

733
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,380
Every time I pass the Waterside Pavilion for Reflections,

734
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,350
I would leave more water energy.

735
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,820
When the water energy is enough,

736
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,340
I will use my body to summon my spirit.

737
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,700
If the spirit breaks the barrier by force,

738
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,980
it will break.

739
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,380
You'll die a horrible death.

740
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,780
It's said that on the day when the Bone-Corroding Harp reappeared,

741
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,740
a star

742
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,940
went straight to the sky

743
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,220
and fell on Luo Ning.

744
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,460
So?

745
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,540
That's not a star.

746
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,940
It's the remaining spiritual power left by the Bone-Corroding Harp.

747
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,780
It returned to the master.

748
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,940
What do you mean?

749
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,280
Luo Ning is the disciple of Immortal Ze Shui.

750
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,460
Just like the spirit of the Sun

751
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,420
fell on Liu Shao.

752
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,250
While the immortal energy of Ze Shui

753
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,380
fell on Luo Ning.

754
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,580
Luo Ge should have known about this long ago.

755
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,480
He was afraid that his sister would be affected by Ze Shui's hatred.

756
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,020
So he asked her to copy scriptures since she was young

757
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,700
to calm her mind.

758
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,100
It is said the Bone-Corroding Harp

759
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,700
can heal all wounds.

760
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,500
So I want to take a risk.

761
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,540
She can save me.

762
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,860
She will save me.

763
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,780
I hope so.

764
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,460
As long as I can collect her heart.

765
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,660
The problem is

766
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,020
the Little Fairy's heart

767
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,170
is hard to collect.

768
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,340
The seclusion did you well.

769
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,380
You look much better.

770
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,060
I was injured a while ago

771
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,140
and recuperated for a few days.

772
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:41,740
It's not seclusion.

773
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,300
Tell me.

774
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,740
Why did you want to see me?

775
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,740
I never drink.

776
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,700
Really?

777
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,380
I've never drunk before.

778
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,380
You dare not face it

779
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,740
or drink this wine.

780
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,260
You're afraid that after drinking it,

781
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,620
you'll behave like Lu Li.

782
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,180
That's right.

783
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,140
Here.

784
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,860
How is she?

785
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:20,900
Who?

786
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,780
She? Who?

787
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,620
You know the answer.

788
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,820
You didn't allow her to stay in Xiyin Mountain.

789
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,820
So I asked Master to take her away.

790
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,460
I don't know where she is now.

791
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,740
But,

792
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,220
Master will take good care of her.
