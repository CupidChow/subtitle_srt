[Episode 2]

4
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,780
What's going on? The test hasn't started yet?

5
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,500
Lu Li hasn't yet come?

[Wu Yang Duke's disciple, Xue]

7
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,580
Look over there.

8
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,100
It's about to start.

9
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,780
All disciples, listen to the order.

10
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,610
Demons have infiltrated the boundary.

11
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,300
Demons?

12
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,460
It's among you.

13
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,340
Within half of an hour,

14
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,540
whoever finds and defeats them

15
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,500
will be deemed to have passed the test.

16
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,860
The test begins now.

17
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,140
What's this?

18
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,579
What's this guy doing?

19
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:15,980
That's enough.

20
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,980
The test requires only to beat him.

21
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,350
You…

22
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,220
These demons are vicious.

23
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,060
If you do good to him,

24
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,820
you're harming your fellows.

25
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,660
The demon has been removed.

26
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
I'm one of the disciples, Xi.

27
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,020
Can I advance to the next level?

28
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,810
Why is the incense still burning?

29
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,860
Is there another demon among us?

30
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,700
Could there be another one? ,

31
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,140
It's not over yet.

32
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,300
Are you the demon?

33
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,260
Are you the demon?

34
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,140
Stay away from me.

35
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,820
Stay away from me.

36
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,020
What a trick!

37
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,579
The demon is her.

38
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,450
Me?

39
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,140
If not,

40
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,740
why did the demon have to attack you?

41
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,140
And why did you plead for him?

42
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,660
That's slander.

43
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,660
Cut it out.

44
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,459
I learned such a trick as sprinkling powder

45
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,100
when I was six years old.

46
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,900
Lu Li?

47
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,740
How did you get in?

48
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
I have legs, of course I walked in.

49
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,420
I think you were taken as a test question.

50
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,260
So

51
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
I didn't come empty-handed.

52
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,300
Here's your chance.

53
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,340
Go and kill him.

54
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,620
No, I'm scared.

55
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,940
You'd better find someone else.

56
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,420
You can't?

57
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,980
I can't.

58
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,610
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,220
I'm afraid.

60
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,610
You just did a good job. Why can't you do it now?

61
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,260
Hey, look at this.

62
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,460
Oh, I see.

63
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,170
You have the guts to fight with girls.

64
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,180
What you did

65
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,980
just now with the move

66
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,210
is not bad.

67
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,460
Try it.

68
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,500
You're underestimating me.

69
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,420
Wow!

70
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,940
So it's a demon of a tree branch.

71
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,900
Wow!

72
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,980
Awesome.

73
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,980
That's something.

74
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,860
I accidentally swung and he died?

75
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,650
In fact, what Wu Yang Duke plans to test

76
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,900
is the strong courage to overcome fear

77
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,860
as well as demons.

78
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,060
If you don't have it,

79
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,420
no matter how great you are,

80
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,260
you're not what they want.

81
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,180
Got it?

82
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,860
Welcome to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

83
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,580
This is

84
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,420
the senior female disciple of the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke,

85
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,020
Bai Feng.

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,250
[Chief female disciple of the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke, Bai Feng]

87
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,820
We've seen

88
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,060
your performance just now.

89
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,660
Later on, all the disciples who pass this round of tests

90
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,580
will receive a golden flower card

91
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,660
and will be qualified to enter the next round.

92
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,780
I've made it to the second round.

93
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,820
I've made it to the second round.

94
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,409
My hand!

95
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,250
My hand.

96
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,140
Brother.

97
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,100
I just saw you fly over in a flash.

98
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,900
Teach me sometime.

99
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,220
100 taels for a pinch. 300 taels for pain.

100
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,290
Brother, I'm Wang Jian. And you?

101
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,700
I'm Lu Li.

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,659
Nice to meet you.

103
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,020
Disciples without the golden flower cards

104
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,980
shouldn't be discouraged either.

105
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,020
The Mansion of Wu Yang Duke always welcomes

106
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,020
those who want to fight evil and defend justice.

107
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,540
But only if you have the strength to do so,

108
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,980
not by luck.

109
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,700
Those who pass with the help of others…

110
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
It's him.

111
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,100
won't count.

112
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,140
Liu Shao

113
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,100
cheated.

114
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,380
This is the senior male disciple of the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke,

115
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,220
Du Mingchong.

116
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,820
In the past, he was the one

117
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,260
who decided the selection of the disciples.

118
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,770
Senior Du,

119
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
do you have other plans here?

120
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,820
Did she get through

121
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,980
with your help?

122
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,700
Senior Du,

123
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,940
I just gave her

124
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,820
some advice.

125
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,100
She managed to do it herself.

126
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,740
You don't deserve

127
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,780
to call me “senior”.

128
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,300
I thought we were peers now that I'm in the Duke's Mansion.

129
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,540
But there's a hierarchy in the Duke's Mansion,

130
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,860
unlike what Wu Yang Duke said

131
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,980
that everyone is equal.

132
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,740
Forgive me for crossing the line.

133
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,260
You're beating around the bush

134
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,580
and pressuring me with what the Lord said.

135
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,580
Then let me see what you can do.

136
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,620
Ouch

137
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,500
Senior Du.

138
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,290
You're the eldest disciple of the mansion.

139
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,260
Why bother with a newcomer like him?

140
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,660
-Besides, the selection process is strict. -Don't move.

141
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,300
-If she doesn't have the talent... -He didn't touch you, did he?

142
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,740
how can she get into the next round?

143
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,980
My ass.

144
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,700
I've already sent out the golden flower card.

145
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,140
Senior Du.

146
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,460
Will you do me a favor?

147
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,220
Since Bai Feng has asked,

148
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,660
-I should do her the favor. -Lu Li, are you okay?

149
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
As for whether you can stay in the future,

150
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,100
it depends on their ability.

151
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,900
Liu Shao.

152
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,780
Thank you.

153
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,060
All the disciples who have received their golden flower cards,

154
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,820
please follow me to Yu Yu Hall.

155
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,330
Brother.

156
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,340
Brother.

157
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,140
What's up?

158
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,780
Do you like Liu Shao?

159
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,690
What are you talking about? Unless I'm blind.

160
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,140
Why does helping her have to mean I like her?

161
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,620
Maybe

162
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,220
she bought me into helping her.

163
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,940
As the old saying goes,

164
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,890
beating is kissing, scolding is loving.

165
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,340
Beating is kissing, scolding is loving?

166
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,140
I'm just kidding.

167
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
Look, there's the Yu Yu Hall in front of us.

168
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,660
Let me take you there.

169
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,020
Go.

170
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,460
Let's go.

171

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,580
Kneel.

173
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,180
I've arranged for you to catch Liu Shao.

174
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,020
But only two of you came back alive.

175
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,140
And you came back empty-handed.

176
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,100
How dare you

177
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,140
show up in front of me?

178
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,740
I managed to do it.

179
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,060
It's Lu Sheng's disciple

180
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,090
who ruined it.

181
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,260
Yes, it's Lu Li.

182
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,500
Lu Li was protecting her in secret.

183
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,380
Ao Hen sent you here, right?

184
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,260
Go back and tell that old demon.

185
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,020
I'll take care of Liu Shao.

186
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,380
Tell her to give up.

187
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,940
For so many years,

188
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,540
I've been searching for demon energy

189
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,980
to nourish your young master

190
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,540
and barely keep him alive.

191
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,300
Now

192
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,500
it's a rare chance that Liu Shao shows up

193
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,180
and my son can be cured.

194
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,220
But you two let her get away.

195
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,660
It can't be pardoned.

196
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,900
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

197
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,940
Forgive me.

198
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,020
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

199
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,210
-In the way of my son's survival. - Forgive me, Your Majesty!

200
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,620
You losers.

201
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,050
How dare you beg for mercy?

202
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,660
Yin, be a good boy.

203
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,460
I promise you.

204
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,940
I will get Liu Shao

205
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,420
and transfer the power from her body to you.

206
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,660
This is Wu Yang Duke.

207
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,260
The lord of the human world?

208
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,140
What an overrated eye candy!

209
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,020
He's useless

210
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,140
except for his good looks.

211
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,980
Can't you see the seat of Wu Yang Duke

212
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,140
is still empty?

213
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,500
I mean…

214
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,500
I mean, how stupid are you?

215
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,820
That's Wu Yang Duke's top general,

216
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,180
Fang Zhan, Chief Fang.

217
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,700
Forget it.

218
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,820
You'll get to know

219
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
in the mansion.

220
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,940
Actually,

221
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,020
there's nothing wrong with being overrated eye candy.

222
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,860
Overrated as they are,

223
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,460
they're good-looking anyway.

224
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,380
They look much more pleasing to the eye

225
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,140
than those with an intimidating face.

226
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,820
Happy?

227
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,260
Who is overrated? Who are you talking about?

228
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,970
Be quiet.

229
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,260
Today,

230
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,580
you've come to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

231
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,490
Although you haven't yet become official disciples,

232
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,260
you should know

233
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,820
every disciple of the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke

234
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,460
has the responsibility of protecting the human race.

235
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,860
All of you have come here.

236
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,900
I'm sure you all have the desire to eradicate evil

237
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,500
and protect the people.

238
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,380
But to do that,

239
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,660
you will inevitably face risks at all times,

240
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,460
in danger of dying.

241
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,420
If you feel remorse,

242
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,180
you can leave now.

243
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,260
I'll be able to learn something,

244
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
so that I don't have to be afraid of Ao Hen.

245
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,370
Good.

246
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,450
If that's the case,

247
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,620
you can settle down in the mansion first.

248
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,820
I'll wait for you to go through hard study

249

and rigorous trials

250
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,860
to finally succeed

251
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,580
and pacify the demons and protect the beings.

252
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,980
Pacify the demons and protect the beings!

253
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,180
Am I a dog?

254

Come on, follow me.

What?

257
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,690
Don't you understand?

258
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,820
Senior Du was clearly trying to screw you.

259
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,980
Trying to screw me?

260
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,220
You must have offended him in

in some way.

346
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,460
Let me help you.

347
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,740
Thank you.

348
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,540
Okay.

349
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,380
Let me do it.

350
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,420
No need.

351
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,170
Thank you then.

352
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,340
It's my first time making a quilt.

353
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,860
It feels good.

354
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,220
Miss.

355
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,060
Which bed do I have?

356
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,060
They're all full.

357
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,290
Liu Shao.

358
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,300
You're rich, aren't you?

359
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,140
Find your way.

360
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,980
Then where should I stay?

361
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,290
Come with me.

362
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,420
Come on.

363
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,860
Lu.

364
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,300
Lu.

365
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,940
What I respect most in my life

366
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,980
is a wise and brave man like you.

367
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,260
Don't crowd inside the small room with other disciples.

368
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,260
You can stay with me.

369
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,540
Look, take your pick.

370
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,740
Take your pick.

371
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,340
Wait.

372
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,740
The Mansion of Wu Yang Duke has always been fair.

373
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,060
Why are you being special?

374
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,220
You're even given a room

375
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,660
that only the official disciples can stay in?

376
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,060
Actually,

377
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,980
my grandfather

378
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,020
did great things with the former Wu Yang Duke.

379
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,100
He was a meritorious minister.

380
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,340
He begged the Lord

381
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,460
to take care of me.

382
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,940
Good for you. Offspring of a meritorious minister.

383
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,820
Should I

384
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
seek shelter from you then?

385
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,820
Not really.

386
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,660
I only get a little help with food and supplies.

387
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,050
As for the following test,

388
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,860
we have to fight it with our ability.

389
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,300
I am

390
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,660
stupid and fat,

391
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,380
and slow to learn martial arts.

392
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,170
No one in my clan thinks highly of me.

393
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,100
Even my father is laughed at for this.

394
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,130
So your father…

395
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,060
Is he

396
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,660
disappointed in you?

397
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,300
No.

398
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,940
My father said I was the best.

399
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,540
My father told me

400
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,100
when I finished my studies,

401
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,620
I'd be celebrated with a banquet

402
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,890
and arranged with a marriage.

403
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
You must come then.

404
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,380
We can have some drinks.

405
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,420
This way.

406
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,620
This is my bed.

407
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,900
You can sleep here from now on.

408
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:27,740
Oh.

409
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,260
I'll clean it up for you.

410
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,820
There is no other choice.

411
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,580
I'll have to ask you to crowd inside the room with me.

412
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,620
It's okay.

413
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,620
It's fine here.

414
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,180
But sister,

415
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,660
why do you live here too?

416
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,620
You mean why I live in such a humble place, right?

417
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,860
Actually,

418
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,780
I'm just a lowly servant of the Duke's Mansion.

419
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,930
I do menial work for Bai.

420
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,540
And I've been doing it for a long time.

421
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,620
So I'm allowed to take care of the newcomers.

422
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,980
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,290
It's okay.

424
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,140
There's food and shelter here.

425
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,780
I'm fully clothed every day.

426
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,860
I'm satisfied.

427
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:03,900
By the way,

428
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,940
you haven't gotten your disciple's uniform yet, have you?

429
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,220
I have a suit here.

430
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
You can wear it for now.

431
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,380
New uniforms will be brought tomorrow.

432
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,980
Thank you, sister.

433
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,660
What does the “Survival Guide” say?

434
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,820
Money can make the Devil work for you.

435
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,700
There is nothing money can't do.

436
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,940
If someone treats you well,

437
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,820
you have to repay him with money.

438
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,260
Sister, this is for you.

439
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,900
Did someone teach you to take care of things with money?

440
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,060
Then you're using it on the wrong person.

441
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,300
I'm just an insignificant person.

442
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,860
You'd better think about

443
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,740
how to pass the following tests

444
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,900
with your competence.

445
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,460
Oh.

446
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,900
What Brother Lu Li?

447
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,620
He's just a liar.

448
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,740
Damn liar.

449
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,060
I was blind

450
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,580
to think he was immortal.

451
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,060
He doesn't look anything like that.

452
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,100
He's just

453
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,410
a big shithead.

454
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,640
[Chief of the Human Race, Wu Yang Duke]

455
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,300
Who is it?

456
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,970
Sir.

457
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,380
Your sword dance was spectacular.

458
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,060
You just... swish, swish.

459
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,180
Swish, swish.

460
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,660
Awesome.

461
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,620
My father told me

462
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,380
a good show

463
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,580
must be rewarded.

464
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,140
Do you think I'm an entertainer?

465
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,330
That's not the same.

466
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,980
Sir, don't be embarrassed.

467
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,900
Take it.

468
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,300
It's a small token of my appreciation.

469
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,490
The one outside, come out.

470
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,420
Lu Li?

471
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,060
Sir, you don't have to be polite to me.

472
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,060
You're not dressed like

473
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,860
the low-ranking disciples, like me,

474
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,060
nor are you dressed like high-ranking disciples, like Du Mingchong.

475
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,980
I suppose

476
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,900
you're just a lowly disciple.

477
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,700
And you're old.

478
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,340
It must be hard for you.

479
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,020
Am I right, Lu Li?

480
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,620
I don't know you.

481
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,380
I'm Liu Shao.

482
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,100
I'm disciple Lu Li.

483
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,780
This is one of the newcomers, Liu Shao.

484
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,060
Greetings, Wu Yang Duke.

485
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,620
My lord,

486
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,220
please forgive Liu Shao's ignorance.

487
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,090
Kneel.

488
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,540
You...

489
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,100
You are Wu Yang Duke?

490
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,540
No.

491
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,980
She... she...

492
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,260
I'm just an old

493
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,180
and lowly disciple.

494
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,900
It's hard for me.

495
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,460
No, no.

496
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,500
I... I was wrong.

497
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,780
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

498
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,220
In the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke,

499
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,900
who else would wear neither the high-ranking disciple's uniform

500
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,460
nor the low-ranking disciple's uniform?

501
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,820
I didn't know that.

502
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:07,730
Besides,

503
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,810
no matter how ignorant you are,

504
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,780
you must have heard of

505
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,580
the Lord's Lightning Slash, right?

506
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,220
Lighting Slash?

507
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,340
That was Lightning Slash you just did?

508
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,420
Do you think

509
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,860
it's worthy of your gold leaf?

510
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,100
It's much more valuable than the gold leaf.

511
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,620
Can you teach me?

512
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,540
Well, you...

513
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,980
Do you really want to learn?

514
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,020
Yes.

515
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,060
This is the simplest move of the Lighting Slash.

516
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:03,860
Learn it.

517
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,170
My Lord, can you slow down a bit?

518
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,780
It was too fast, and I didn't catch it.

519
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,580
Shut up.

520
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,060
My Lord,

521
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,420
she is stupid and ignorant.

522
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,170
How can she learn your Lightning Slash?

523
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,580
Please forgive her.

524
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,260
She knows she's wrong.

525
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,540
She knows she's wrong.

526
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,660
Do you think I'm joking?

527
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,660
I know who you are.

528
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,660
The demons out there are all after her.

529
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,700
As for you,

530
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,740
the day you came to the mansion, you fought the demons alone.

531
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,500
You were lucky enough to defeat Ao Hen.

532
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,620
You are not simple characters.

533
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,260
My Lord.

534
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,500
You must be mistaken.

535
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,580
I... I...

536
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,460
I have a task for you now.

537
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,980
The official test is half a month away.

538
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,140
If she doesn't learn this move,

539
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,460
the two of you will have to leave the Duke's Mansion together.

540
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,820
You'll also be charged with

541
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,340
the crime of disrespect.

542
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,300
Do I have a grudge against you?

543
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,780
Do I owe you a lot of money?

544
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,340
Why did you come to this forest?

545
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,090
What?

546
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,900
You don't have a grudge against me.

547
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,780
But you owe me a lot of money.

548
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,810
You took my money

549
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,100
and left me alone.

550
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,140
So I ran to the forest

551
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,420
to curse you.

552
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,580
How do you know I don't care about you?

553
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,540
Did you ever take care of me?

554
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,380
I didn't?

555
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,260
I…

556
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,020
What kind of crap is the “Survival Guide”

557
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,060
you gave me?

558
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,300
It was a lie.

559
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,050
I almost didn't even have a place to live.

560
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,380
And

561
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,500
you knew I was new at the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

562
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,740
I didn't know the place well.

563
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,980
But you didn't even come to see me.

564
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,060
I mean.

565
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,060
Aren't you good at martial arts?

566
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,130
I'm just

567
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,260
a useless liar.

568
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,100
How can you

569
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,530
take what a girl says in anger seriously?

570
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,740
Oh, I…

571
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,740
Oh, okay, okay.

572
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,620
I'm wrong, all right?

573
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,700
You are wrong.

574
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,220
I'm wrong.

575
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,940
Give me your hand.

576
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,940
What?

577
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
Give it to me.

578
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,140
I'll show you the other world of the liar.

579
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,060
Close your eyes.

580
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,740
Open your eyes.

581
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,230
[Dream Moon Boundary]

582
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,620
What a beautiful place!

583
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,570
Where is this place?

584
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,780
This is the illusion I created with my magic,

585
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,340
Dream Moon Boundary.

586
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,780
But you can't use illusions inside the mansion.

587
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,300
My master taught me how to create

588
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,940
the Dream Moon Boundary.

589
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,820
It's different from other illusions.

590
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,300
It won't be discovered.

591
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,500
Oh.

592
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,740
Pull it out.

593
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,300
I was thinking about

594
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,380
what weapon you should use.

595
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,580
The Lord happened to ask you to practice the Lighting Slash.

596
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,780
How about

597
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,580
trying this sword?

598
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,900
It should suit you well.

599
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,140
It seems

600
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,580
that you've been helping me out.

601
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,660
I'll give you an extra 5,000 taels.

602
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,620
Let's wait until you learn the Lighting Slash.

603
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,780
But

604
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,620
there's half a month left.

605
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,580
I'm suspicious about if I can do it.

606
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,140
You don't know.

607
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,620
In fact, time inside the illusion

608
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,300
passes by much more slowly than outside.

609
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,690
But now,

610
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,740
it's not a matter of time.

611
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,780
We need to know the sword technique of Lighting Slash before carrying on.

612
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,500
We don't have the sword manual.

613
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,090
Now our fate is in your hands.

614
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,700
You have to learn the Lighting Slash.

615
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,090
Or else

616
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,820
we'll be crushed to pieces

617
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,700
like the gold leaf just now.

618
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,060
As for things I'm interested in,

619
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,220
like swordplay,

620
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,820
drawing charms, and skits,

621
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,180
I'm quick to learn them.

622
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,060
But not the things like poetry, rituals, and music,

623
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,780
because I don't like them.

624
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,020
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

625
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:21,860
Okay.

626
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,700
The first step,

627
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,780
we can't let the little flame

628
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,140
fall from the tip of the sword.

629
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,260
Do you understand?

630
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,140
Yes.

631
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,340
Come on.

632
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,050
Concentrate on

633
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,660
the spirit fire at the tip of the sword.

634
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,380
The sword follows the mind. The mind follows the heart. The mind and the heart coexist.

635
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,620
The power of the sword

636
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,860
will naturally be formed.

637

[Mansion of Wu Yang Duke]

638
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,500
The new disciples' martial arts test

639
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,739
is in a few days.

640
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,860
Before the test,

641
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,780
according to the Lord's instructions,

642
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,820
I will teach you to practice

643
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,860
the Duke's Mansion's unique method of mental discipline

644
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,460
-to improve your cultivation. -Brother.

645
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,860
You've been hanging out with Liu Shao for the past several days.

646
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,820
Is there something you're not telling me?

647
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,060
Nonsense.

648
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,340
I'm afraid she'll be eliminated. I was tutoring her.

649
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,580
You're not worried about me being eliminated?

650
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,739
I can't believe the new disciple, Liu Shao,

651
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,810
wanted to learn the Lighting Slash.

652
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,740
I gave her half a month's time.

653
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,980
Do you think

654
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
she can learn it?

655
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,700
Well.

656
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,220
I think you've overestimated her.

657
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,340
She may not be able to learn it

658
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,860
even in a year.

659
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,140
How much can she learn

660
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,540
in half a month?

661
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,300
I've been practicing for so long.

662
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,380
Do you think I've accomplished it?

663
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,700
The stance is 70 percent like it.

664
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,940
Breath, 30 percent.

Sword intent…

666
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,500
Not a single bit.

667
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,540
What is the sword intent of Lighting Slash?

668
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,180
I have a three-foot blade

669
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,460
to eradicate all the unjust things.

670
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,660
This is the sword intent of the Lighting Slash.

671
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,940
Back in the day,

672
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,660
there was a time

673
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,500
when Wu Yang Duke did great things.

674
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,740
What injustice?

675
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,890
Of course.

676
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,100
This is

677
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,940
too complicated

678
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,340
for Miss Liu

679
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,260
who is high and mighty

680
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,500
and spends money at will,

681
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,690
having no idea of what the world's suffering is.

682
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,020
I don't know about the world's suffering?

683
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,300
I was being chased

684
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,340
by Ao Hen and had no place to stay before I came here.

685
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,980
Demons, big or small,

686
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,370
always come after me.

687
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,660
And now,

688
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,140
I could be killed by Wu Yang Duke at any time.

689
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,700
I'd like to be the old Miss Liu again.

690
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,900
But now

691
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,220
I can't even go home.

692
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,090
Um.

693
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,940
Actually,

694
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,740
it's not that bad.

695
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,780
Don't worry.

696
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,460
I have your back.

697
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,380
I will make your family reunite.

698
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,140
Trust me.

699
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,180
Come on.

700
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,460
Keep practicing.

701
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,220
Come on.

702
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,140
I should think Ao Hen as an injustice.

703
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,410
Kill her, kill her.

704
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,130
Kill her, kill her.

705
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,700
She has gone a little crazy with her practice.

706
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,220
I have to be careful when we practice today.

707
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
Your stance is not right.

708
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,130
Who taught you that?

709
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,260
Kill her!

710
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,100
Liu Shao hit Du.

711
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:08,980
With what?

712
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,820
I don't know.

713
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,660
A golden light.

714
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,540
Liu has been hiding her strength.

715
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,820
Are you okay, Du?

716
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,890
That's all for today's practice.

717
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,340
Everyone, go back to your rooms

718
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,260
and prepare for tomorrow's test.

719
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,340
Amazing.

720
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,780
I can easily exceed the time limit

721
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,500
practicing in the Dream Moon Boundary.

722
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,020
I can't let others find out.

723
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,580
What are you eating? Are you sick?

724
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,740
No, I'm not.

725
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,140
What's wrong?

726
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,140
Sit down.

727
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,580
What's this?

728
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,380
Give it to me.

729
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,940
Spirit-locking pill?

730
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,860
This is Xi's.

731
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,500
Why did she give you this?

732
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,180
Why did you eat it?

733
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,580
Tell me.

734
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,780
Today I went to beg Bai Feng.

735
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,060
She exceptionally let me take the disciple test too.

736
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,340
But I didn't expect such a coincidence.

737
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,060
I was assigned to a group with Xi.

738
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,980
But why would she harm you?

739
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,820
I've worked in the mansion for many years

740
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,380
and learned a lot of skills secretly.

741
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,340
Xi might

742
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,260
be afraid to lose to me

743
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,260
and lose face if I eliminate her.

744
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,180
No way.

745
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,100
I have to go to tell Bai Feng.

746
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,540
Don't go.

747
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,620
Why?

748
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,820
My mother is working as a cook in Xi's mansion.

749
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,700
She signed a life-and-death contract.

750
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:15,970
So Liu Shao,

751
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,740
it's okay.

752
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,380
Forget it.

753
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,260
Forget it? Why forget it?

754
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,370
We can't just let it go.

755
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,620
Let's see.

756
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,340
This is the sentence.

757
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,900
Xi.

758
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,300
-How dare you poison Xue? -Take a good look.

759
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,180
Liu Shao, are you crazy?

760
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,460
At tomorrow's disciple test,

761
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,700
we will fight against each other.

762
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,620
The losers will quit.

763
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,140
You're afraid of losing to Xue, so you poisoned her.

764
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,460
What are you talking about?

765
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,500
This is slander.

766
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,420
This is evidence.

767
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,380
This is your medicine bottle.

768
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,100
It still smells like the spirit-locking pill.

769
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,660
You're a fool.

770
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,980
Your evidence is gone.

771
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,740
I'll go tell Bai Feng.

772
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,740
Fine by me.

773
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,490
Xue just gets sick.

774
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,620
Go and tell on me.

775
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,100
See if the lowly cook's daughter

776
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,860
dares to fight against me.

777
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,460
Burn the fire, cook the food.

778
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,420
She's self-reliant.

779
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,580
Who are you to say she's lowly?

780
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,460
A lowly person is born to be inferior.

781
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,020
Miss Liu,

782
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,700
don't pretend to be noble.

783
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,580
We're the same.

784
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,620
We were born to be waited on.

785
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,340
We're not the same.

786
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,540
We've never been the same.

787
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,500
Tomorrow,

788
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,500
I will challenge you

789
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,780
for Xue.
