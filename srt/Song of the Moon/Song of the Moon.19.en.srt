4
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,860
Are you their new Demon King?

5
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,140
No.

6
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,020
Then why are you here?

7
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,020
Thank you for protecting my whole clan

8
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,380
in the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors.

9
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,580
At the same time,

10
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,980
I also want to tell you something.

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,740
What is it?

12
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,940
Aquatic Demons

13
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,420
were once the King of the demon world.

14
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,100
I've investigated it thoroughly.

15
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,300
These demons

16
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,020
killed people outside recently.

17
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
They deserve to die.

18
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,380
Accessories should also be punished slightly.

19
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,340
Those who refuse to be moralized

20
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,620
and still want to kill

21
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,060
should be killed without mercy.

22
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,740
The other demons

23
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,300
will serve me as the king,

24
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,010
be restricted by me,

25
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,940
and never cross the line again.

26
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,420
I don't know who your new Demon King is.

27
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,740
But now,

28
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,740
if you don't regard me as the king,

29
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,220
all you can do is waiting to die.

30
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,620
Greetings, Demon King in White.

31
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,940
This

32
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
is not up to you.

33
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,660
Immortal, let me

34
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,260
deal with this trifle.

35
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,380
Move.

36
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,390
Liu Shao!

37
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
Brother.

38
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,500
It's really you.

39
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,580
Brother.

40
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,500
Brother.

41
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,700
You came at the right time.

42
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,900
He's my brother.

43
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,090
Brother.

44
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,540
Who is your brother?

45
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,300
I'm Luo Ge.

46
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,460
Aren't you my brother?

47
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,290
What happened?

48
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,370
Where is the Protection Spell of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion?

49
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,780
Since the Lord died,

50
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,940
no one has reinforced the Protection Spell.

51
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,530
And the demons keep attacking

52
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,540
Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

53
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,220
Today,

54
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,530
the protection spell was broken.

55
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,820
That's why Marquis Wuyang's Mansion suffered this disaster.

56
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,100
Even Captain Fang...

57
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,100
Captain Fang was also killed.

58
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,180
A lot disciples of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion were injured.

59
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,540
Even though we escaped,

60
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,659
we don't know where to go.

61
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,220
If this continues,

62
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,900
the mortal world will become the demons' territory.

63
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,460
Even Marquis Wuyang's Mansion was defeated?

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,730
Brother.

65
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,900
Where did he go?

66
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,700
That direction

67
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,940
should be Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

74
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,060
may emerge again.

75

That's right.

76
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,100
Yeah.

Yes.

Great!

How much immortal energy did it take?

91
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
It's stronger than the Lord's Protection Spell.

92
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,460
I'm truly in awe.

93

One day,

97
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,980
I will regain the reputation of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

98

Why don't you trust me?

Look, the Protection Spell has been rebuilt.

105
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,780
Indeed.

He Na

107
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,900
is also an interesting person who matches your temperament.

108
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,420
I guess so.

109
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,060
Who would believe that?

110
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,180
You can ask my brother.

Yes.

Steping on lotus,

117
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,620
he went back to Xiyin Mountain in a moment.

118
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,539
Really?

119
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,890
It's just that

120
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,780
he seems angry.

121
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,980
Is it because you

122
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,540
helped He Na escape secretly?

123
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,530
Actually, He Na has helped us a lot.

124
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,580
But

125
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,460
he's now Luo Ge.

126
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,260
He doesn't remember anything about Lu Li.

127
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,860
Sister-in-law.

128
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,220
I finally believe

129
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,020
Immortal Luo Ge

130
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,610
is my brother, Lu Li.

131
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,780
He's much more capable than before

132
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,740
and his temper has changed

133
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:11,940
but

134
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,940
he's still good at

135
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,540
driving people crazy.

136
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,300
He came by

137
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,460
and protected all of us.

138
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,620
I am sure about my intuition.

139
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,890
It's true that he's good at driving people crazy.

140
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,900
He went back to Xiyin Mountain in an instant.

141
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,020
What should I do?

142
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,740
Should I crawl back on an empty stomach?

143
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,930
How about

144
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,980
go back after eating?

145
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,660
Let's go.

146
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,460
My drumstick is waiting for you.

147
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,180
Let's go.

148
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,820
And...

149
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,980
And trotters, right?

150
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,180
And trotters.

151
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,890
Brother.

152
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,620
Brother.

153
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,860
Brother.

154
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,580
Brother.

155
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,420
Fairy.

156
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,380
Immortal went into seclusion as soon as he came back.

157
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,620
He said he won't see anyone.

158
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,380
Not seeing anyone?

159
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,060
Who are you?

160
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,140
Where is Liu Shao?

161
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,340
I’m the lady-in-waiting sent by the Immortal Master of Palace Wuji

162
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,940
to serve Immortal.

163
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,140
My name is Bai Feng.

164
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,820
Liu Shao is not here.

165
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,180
I guess she's staying in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

166
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,820
Did she

167
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,540
forget about my matter?

168
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,220
You mean...

169
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,420
It's nothing serious.

170
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,580
But

171
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,260
don't tell them I've been here.

172
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,050
The poison of Brahma Lotus

173
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,020
has been detoxified.

174
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,820
Why hasn't the wound healed yet?

175
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,980
Even the spiritual power

176
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,460
are still weakening.

177
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,140
Immortal.

178
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,500
Immortal.

179
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,780
Are you inside?

180
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,860
Immortal Master sent me to serve you.

181
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,540
Lu Li.

182
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,820
Is that you?

183
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,450
I will get you this time.

184
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,860
Liu Shao.

185
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,980
Get out.

186
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,060
Get out!

187
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,570
Liu Shao.

188
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,180
Liu Shao again.

189
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,020
The person around you

190
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,740
can only be me.

191
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,380
None of them is here.

192
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,940
How boring.

193
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,220
Brother,

194
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,420
I heard you brought a bad guy

195
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,460
back to Xiyin Mountain.

196
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,780
Can I

197
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,700
practice magic

198
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,690
and hit him for fun?

199
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,530
No.

200
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,180
The person is sinister and cunning.

201
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,340
Don't even think about getting close.

202
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,890
I set a restriction

203
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,340
in the place where he is imprisoned.

204
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,580
As long as you get close to him within one inch,

205
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,820
I'll find out soon.

206
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,940
Brother is lying to me again.

207
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,650
There's no restriction at all.

208
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,620
Who is the fairy outside?

209
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,660
Can you chat with me?

210
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,740
Tell me.

211
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,130
What despicable things have you done

212
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,980
that made you arrested?

213
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,500
If I say I'm innocent,

214
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,900
do you believe me?

215
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,100
Fu, General of Water

216
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,500
and the younger brother of the Demon King in White.

217
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,300
If you say you're innocent,

218
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,900
I'm afraid

219
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,380
no one is villain in this world.

220
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,540
You know me?

221
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,940
My brother

222
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,460
never let me know about the demon world

223
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,540
since I was little,

224
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,580
as if I have a grudge against the demon world.

225
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,500
But if I want to know,

226
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,260
there's nothing I can't know.

227
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,460
Not only do I know you,

228
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,780
I also know

229
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
you are totally different from your brother.

230
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,420
You

231
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,100
are called General of Water

232
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,740
but you don't usually use water as weapon.

233
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,820
Your weapon is a curved knife.

234
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,140
Besides, you're ruthless.

235
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,780
You seem quite free now.

236
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,860
Why don't you play your curved knife?

237
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,180
If I do it well,

238
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,530
will you reward me?

239
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,820
Sure.

240
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,060
Of course.

241
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,780
What do you think?

242
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,260
Not bad.

243
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,380
I knew it.

244
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,780
Your moves are different from the ones from the Immortal Palace.

245
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,300
What do you plan to reward me?

246
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,420
I reward...

247
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,900
I reward you sending me a birthday present.

248
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,900
Since I am imprisoned here,

249
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,220
I'm afraid that's hard for me.

250
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,580
This is your business.

251
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,620
At least tell me

252
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,700
what's your name.

253
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,860
That's also your business.

254
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,380
I like smart people.

255
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,940
If you are smart,

256
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,620
I'll visit you again next time.

257
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,620
Smart people?

258
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,380
Interesting.

259
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,140
Your Majesty.

260
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,140
Mr. Tai.

261
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Is everything ready?

262
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,060
Yes.

263
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,260
Are you in a hurry to use them?

264
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,340
Yes.

265
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,940
Liu Shao was afraid that I'd suffer losses if I had a conflict with Luo Ge

266
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,180
and stopped him

267
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
so that I can leave.

268
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,660
But those people in the Immortal Palace

269
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,660
have been prejudiced against the Demons

270
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,060
and don't like Liu Shao.

271
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,339
Since she protected me like that,

272
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,060
I'm afraid they may vent their anger on her.

273
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,780
In this case,

274
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,819
you have to go to the Immortal Palace.

275
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,579
You may also see

276
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,859
if you can visit General Fu.

277
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,180
Is Immortal Tightwad

278
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,330
still angry?

279
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Immortal.

280
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,130
Liu Shao is back.

281
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Liu Shao hereby apologize to Immortal.

282
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,500
I admit

283
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,460
that I didn't protect Immortal,

284
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,620
but stop you and let He Na leave.

285
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,300
I know

286
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,420
Immortal was angry because the demons crossed the line.

287
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,780
But Immortal,

288
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,180
have you ever thought about it?

289
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,380
Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

290
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,420
keeps killing demons every year.

291
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,340
But the mortal world is still not peaceful.

292
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,780
It's not because Marquis Wuyang's Mansion is not strong enough,

293
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,860
but because the demons lack a king.

294
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,020
A king that can control them.

295
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,260
It's true.

296
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,620
Today, Immortal can give a warning to everyone by killing one demon.

297
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,140
But what if

298
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,380
they do it again in the future?

299
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Will Immortal choose to kill them again?

300
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
If Immortal chooses counterviolence,

301
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,740
why do you need to cultivate your mind all the time?

302
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,420
Who are you?

303
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,660
How did you get in?

304
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,860
I...

305
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,020
I...

306
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,460
I'm done.

307
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,220
I will kneel here for two hours.

308
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,700
Because I think kneeling for two hours

309
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,140
is enough for my fault.

310
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,380
I'll kneel then.

311
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,580
I kneeled.

312
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,540
Immortal.

313
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,060
Who told you to stand up?

314
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,740
Didn't you say you need to kneel for two hours?

315
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,500
Kneel down.

316
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,300
Wait.

317
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,740
Why is she here?

318
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,570
What did you do last night?

319
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,580
You've been here all night?

320
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,180
You care about it?

321
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,820
Of course I do!

322
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,810
You may leave.

323
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,900
Without my permission,

324
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,020
you can't enter Palace Chonghua in the future.

325
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,620
You're pretending.

326
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,700
Just keep pretending.

327
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,860
Keep your words.

328
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,940
Kneel here for two hours before you come to see me.

329
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,860
You and her...

330
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,100
That bad woman spent the whole night...

331
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,860
What does she want?

332
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,580
Who let you in?

333
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,540
You still have to kneel for 15 minutes.

334
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,690
Get out.

335
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,100
Serve tea.

336
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,370
Coming.

337
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,940
Who asked you to sit?

338
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,780
Bai Feng

339
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,420
is Lu Li's senior

340
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,620
but she's not a good person.

341
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,300
Why is she here?

342
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,220
Immortal Master sent her to serve in Palace Chonghua.

343
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,860
I can't refuse her.

344
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,780
Since you care so much,

345
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,290
I can stop her from coming to Palace Chonghua.

346
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,300
She'll only be in charge of the area around Xiyin Mountain.

347
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,130
That makes sense.

348
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,220
He Na came to the Immortal Palace.

349
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,700
I just received the news that

350
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,020
he seems to have arrived at the Litian Temple.

351
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,220
He said he wants to see me for pleading.

352
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,380
Did he come so fast

353
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,050
because he doesn't want you to suffer here?

354
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,260
You know that He Na

355
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,380
is very loyal to friends.

356
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,500
He treats Lu Li the same way.

357
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,060
Maybe you're right.

358
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,220
Counterviolence is not a long-term solution.

359
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,220
You have convinced me.

360
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,540
The demon world does need a king.

361
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,300
If you can persuade others in the Litian Temple,

362
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,500
I can consider teaching you magic

363
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,140
to protect those you want to protect.

364
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,450
Actually,

365
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,620
the person I want to protect the most is you.

366
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,340
But

367
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,500
I don't think you need my protection.

368
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,220
I'm so thirsty.

369
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,900
The Aquatic Demons is really talented.

370
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,740
How dare you come to the Immortal palace and bargain with us in public?

371
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,820
Do you think we

372
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,420
really forgot

373
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,980
what the Demon King did?

374
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,260
Although the former Demon King is guilty,

375
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,020
our clan has been living in the water

376
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,020
for ten thousand years.

377
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,580
You demons keep harming the mortal world.

378
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,660
Have you ever thought about stopping?

379
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,060
If Immortal Luo Ge hadn't arrived,

380
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,620
you would have destroyed Marquis Wuyang's mansion.

381
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,410
Immortal,

382
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,730
that's why I'm here today.

383
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,420
Tell me what you think.

384
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,860
Since our clan hid underwater,

385
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,820
those demons on land

386
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,300
split apart and entrenched separately.

387
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,900
They divided into four major clans.

388
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,010
When Ao Hen was alive,

389
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
her clan was the most powerful.

390
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,340
After her death,

391
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,020
they've been fighting each other.

392
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,140
Plus, they've been instigated by an unknown person.

393
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,740
That's why they repeatedly violated the realm

394
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,940
and harmed the human race.

395
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,290
Then what are you doing?

396
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,450
There is an unwritten rule in the demon world.

397
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,860
If you surrender to someone,

398
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,300
you have to give out your demon energy

399
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,980
and swear with blood

400
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,500
as a token of eternal obedience

401
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,740
and eternal loyalty.

402
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,740
You mean

403
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
you have subdued a clan?

404
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,020
Yes.

405
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,940
I've subdued the Northwest Demons.

406
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,020
I hereby swear

407
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,140
I will regain the glory of our clan

408
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,940
and become the real Demon King,

409
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,380
leading the demons

410
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,300
to live peacefully with the human race.

411
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,140
So this is your bargaining chip.

412
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,860
What do you want?

413
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,700
Demons won't offend the human race,

414
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,380
the human race should not offend us either.

415
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,420
Even if it's the immortal Palace,

416
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,500
they should treat our clan equally.

417
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,100
That's all?

418
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,300
I also want my brother,

419
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,300
Fu.

420
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,860
You demons never act in good faith.

421
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,940
Who knows what you’re up to?

422
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,700
Ge,

423
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,700
what do you think?

424
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,140
If you agree to

425
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,340
the idea the Demon King raised just now,

426
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,300
please step forward.

427
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,460
Looks like you're the only one who agrees.

428
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,780
Tell us what you think.

429
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,380
May I ask Immortal Master do you think

430
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
among the three worlds,

431
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,380
the demon world is the worst

432
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,500
so even if it will disappear,

433
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,380
it's not a pity?

434
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,020
It is known to all that

435
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,460
demons are despicable.

436
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,410
But why are there four seasons in the mortal world?

437
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,620
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

438
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,700
The winter is known for its coldness.

439
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,060
Should we also give it up?

440
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,820
Without the collection in winter,

441
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,900
there will not be the breeze in spring.

442
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,420
Little girl,

443
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,180
don't try to trap me.

444
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,540
The rule of the four seasons

445
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,020
is also true for the three worlds.

446
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,740
The demon world exists for ten thousand years.

447
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,820
There must be a reason for their existence.

448
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,060
But it's also true that demons love killing cruelly.

449
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,170
I can't tolerate their killing.

450
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,460
I am incompetent.

451
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,500
But I know

452
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,340
in every battle between immortals and demons,

453
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,690
not only demons died,

454
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,180
but also the disciples of Immortal Palace.

455
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,530
But if the demon world is united,

456
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,370
the three worlds can avoid such casualties.

457
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,180
I agree with Liu Shao.

458
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,900
Master Shang.

459
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,540
Her words make sense.

460
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,020
Immortal Master,

461
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,180
don't you want to sacrifice less?

462
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,980
But these

463
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,460
are just your own ideas.

464
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,300
I also think

465
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
we shouldn't decide this with one person's opinion.

466
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,090
We should let everyone in the Immortal Palace decide.

467
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,860
I know.

468
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,740
Every year, the Immortal Palace will send people

469
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,180
to go to the mortal world to help Marquis Wuyang's Mansion kill demons.

470
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,380
I was once in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

471
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,980
so I know you are the ones who are really in danger to kill demons.

472
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,420
They said it's a practice.

473
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,460
But you do know

474
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,530
how many immortal cultivators

475
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,900
died because of that every year.

476
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,060
If it's really like what He Na said,

477
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,900
there is a Demon King in the demon world,

478
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,420
and the demons will be restrained and stop rebelling.

479
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,940
Then you don't have to take any more risks.

480
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,060
Even if he fails,

481
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,060
will it be worse than now?

482
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,740
Why don't you let him try?

483
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,700
If anyone here

484
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,620
agrees to He Na's suggestion,

485
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,490
raise your hand.

486
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,260
Senior.

487
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,940
35 versus 35, even.

488
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,580
It's useless if we are even.

489
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,660
Dismiss.

490
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,380
I'll give you three years.

491
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,620
I want the letter of surrender from the four clans in the demon world.

492
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,860
If you can do it,

493
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,900
your brother will be free.

494
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,140
Ge...

495
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,220
OK.

496
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,860
36 versus 35.

497
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,930
Liu Shao won.

498
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,380
This is the responsibility of Immortal Palace.

499
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,780
It concerns with the welfare of the three worlds,

500
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,140
not the winning or losing.

501
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,380
She won the heart of people.

502
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,860
You don't have to thank me.

503
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,420
You deserve

504
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,580
to be the Demon King of the Land.

505
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,060
I won't say thank you then.

506
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,300
Liu Shao.

507
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,930
Liu Shao.

508
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,700
Go back to Xiyin Mountain with me.

509
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,420
I'll go with you.

510
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,860
I want to see Fu.

511
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,100
No.

512
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,700
Your brother has always been cunning.

513
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,700
It's better not to see him.

514
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,220
Then I'll have a few more words with Liu Shao.

515
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,060
No.

516
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,060
Immortal.

517
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,820
I think...

518
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,580
You need to subdue four demon clans.

519
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,380
You must be busy.

520
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,500
I won't keep you today.

521
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,330
-I'm leaving. -Go.

522
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,540
Bye.

523
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,140
Hey,

524
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,780
can't you be quiet?

525
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,140
I'm quite quiet.

526
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,380
I just remembered something Lu Li said.

527
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,260
Do you want to hear it?

528
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,180
No.

529
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,500
Lu Li

530
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,900
once said

531
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,700
he liked fish slices in vinegar the most.

532
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,980
I think you

533
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,700
also like

534
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,300
fish slices in vinegar the most.

535
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,050
Sorry.

536
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,940
I missed the target just now.

537
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,580
You can't bear to bully that girl,

538
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,820
so you bully me.

539
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Lu Li is like that too.

540
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,699
Why do you want to see Wan Sui?

541
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,900
Luo Ning's birthday is in two days.

542
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,340
I promised to give her

543
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,219
the unique flowers in the three worlds.

544
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,449
Now you think of me.

545
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,780
Tell me.

546
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,139
What flowers do you want?

547
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:29,860
What do you have?

548
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,540
That's too many.

549
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,620
Listen carefully.

550
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,210
Red peony, green peony, hyacinth,

551
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,929
colourful embroidered ball, albizzia flowers, white camellia,

552
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,300
purple waterlily, and yucca rigida.

553
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,300
That's all?

554
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,300
Not satisfied?

555
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,540
So you want

556
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:50,739
a fancy way,

557
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,940
the grassroots style.

558
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,820
Then there is only the dog's tail grass.

559
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,540
I don't think Fairy has seen it before.

560
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,780
Still not satisfied?

561
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,780
That's all I have.

562
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,740
Well...

563
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,100
There is no flower

564
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,540
that Fairy has never seen in three worlds.

565
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,580
I have an idea.

566
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,140
Follow me.

567
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,420
Perfect.

568
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,020
You really forgot my birthday.

569
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,540
This month,

570
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,980
I won't talk to you.

571
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,620
Brother.

572
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,580
You are so busy

573
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,180
but you still find time to come here.

574
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,220
I guess

575
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,420
you must have

576
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,500
prepared an exquisite gift for your sister.

577
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,530
Goodness.

578
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,540
What did you say last time?

579
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,500
You said you will give me

580
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,700
the unique flowers

581
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,820
that I've never seen in three worlds.

582
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,980
Where's the gift?

583
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,170
What's wrong?

584
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,900
You don't want it?

585
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,020
If you don't want it, I'm going back.

586
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,900
Of course I want you to come.

587
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,540
It's my birthday today.

588
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,420
I'm not stupid.

589
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,860
Where are the unique flowers?

590
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,740
Liu Shao.

591
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,790
[Marquis Wuyang's Mansion]

592
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,020
During the end of a season,

593
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,980
flowers will bloom beautifully,

594
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,780
cleaning off all the superficiality.

595
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,460
Hand in hand.

596
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,180
Spend the rest of life together.

597
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:29,820
This...

598
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,660
This is so beautiful.

599
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,500
Is this snowflake?

600
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,660
Liu Shao, look.

601
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,660
I've never seen

602
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,860
such a big

603
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,700
and beautiful snowflake.

604
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,220
This is not snowflake.

605
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,020
This is Weiyang flower.

606
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,620
Weiyang flower?

607
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,420
Liu Shao, is what you just said

608
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,860
the meaning of Weiyang flower?

609
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,220
So beautiful.

610
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,100
Do you like it?

611
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,100
I like it so much.

612
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,380
You're the best.

613
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,620
Luo Ning.

614
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,140
Liu Shao has prepared a banquet

615
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,420
in the garden.

616
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,100
See if you like it.

617
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:03,980
Okay.

618
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,730
Let's go, Liu Shao.

619
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,020
Let's go.

620
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,340
Brother, come on.

621
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,940
Let's go.

622
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,220
Let's go eat something delicious.

623
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,860
Darn it.

624
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,130
All these should be mine.

625
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,460
Liu Shao, try this.

626
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,020
Okay.

627
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,180
Let's drink.

628
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,460
How dare a demon sneak into the Xiyin Mountain?

629
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Come and see me.

630
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,300
Who are you?

631
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,060
General Fu

632
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,580
from the Aquatic Demons.

633
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,180
The brother of the Demon King in White?

634
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,900
The demon aura in your body is hidden so well.

635
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,820
Did you use Lu Sheng’s magic weapon?

636
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,380
Unfortunately,

637
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,260
you can fool others,

638
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,780
but not me.

639
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,580
Even though I'm in decline now,

640
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,700
I'm still the descendant of the Demon King.

641
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,940
I can see the demon energy

642
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,140
in your body clearly.

643
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,780
I don't have any demon aura.

644
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,660
Don't try to trick me.

645
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,220
I'm not that stupid.

646
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
It's interesting.

647
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,340
The demon energy in your body is from Ao Hen.

648
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,810
You got a big advantage.

649
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,330
What do you want?

650
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,180
Did your master Lu Sheng

651
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,980
die recently?

652
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,580
How do you know?

653
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,180
Not only do I know,

654
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,930
I also know who killed him.

655
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,300
Who?

656
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,260
Is a very important person

657
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,540
celebrating the birthday today

658
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,580
in Xiyin Mountain?

659
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,300
The sister of Immortal Luo Ge,

660
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,860
Fairy Luo Ning.

661
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,700
Tell me

662
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,450
who killed my master.

663
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,450
Give this fairy a gift for me.

664
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,580
After that,

665
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,580
I'll tell you.

666
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,860
Slow down.

667
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,620
Liu Shao.

668
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,540
I like you so much.

669
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,860
Thank you

670
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,740
for giving me such a happy birthday.

671
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,540
As long as you are happy.

672
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,020
Let me tell you.

673
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,140
Are you okay?

674
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,980
No.

675
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,340
Brother.

676
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,700
You...

677
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,740
You like her.

678
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,140
I know.

679
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,420
What are you talking about?

680
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,220
Brother.

681
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,820
I'm so happy that you're back.

682
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,580
I finally don't have to look out every day

683
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,900
and miss you day by day.

684
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,580
I miss you so much.

685
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,820
I'm glad you're alive.

686
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,500
I...

687
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,020
Liu Shao.

688
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,900
My brother is really really good.

689
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,940
Am I right?

690
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,780
No.

691
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,100
Okay.

692
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
He's not

693
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,300
your brother.

694
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,580
He is my Lu Li.

695
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,060
Right.

696
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,380
Good taste.

697
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,940
You know what?

698
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,900
You had been with me

699
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,740
for so long in the mortal world.

700
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,500
You should

701
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,500
spend more time

702
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
with your sister.

703
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
Keep her company!

704
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,740
Keep her company.

705
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,620
No need to see me off.

706
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,580
Don't see me off.

707
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,620
Luo Ning.

708
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,500
Bye.
