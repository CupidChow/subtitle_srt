and we can't just sit and watch.

180
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,100
If necessary,

181
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,300
[Eldest Disciple of Wu Yang Duck, Du Mingchong]

182
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,340
take this girl back to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duketo and protect her.

183
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,140
Why hasn't he woken up?

184
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,490
Is he okay?

185
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
He was just exhausted.

186
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,460
He'll be fine after a sleep.

187
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,820
My Lady.

188
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,140
My Lady.

189
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,580
Someone from the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke is here.

190
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,140
Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

191
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,300
Are they here to help us get rid of demons?

192
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:35,940
I'll check it out.

193
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,340
Let's go.

194
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Does it hurt?

195
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,740
Actually,

196
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm...

197
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,700
fine.

198
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,060
But Master,

199
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,620
you are really amazing.

200
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,930
How did you know

201
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,900
the big demon would show up here?

202
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,380
Li,

203
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,380
take this

204
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,500
talisman.

205
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,940
I will use the formation to help you.

206
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,740
You must protect Miss Liu.

207
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,859
Master.

208
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,460
Well.

209
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,780
She's just an ordinary girl.

210
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,580
I don't think

211
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,780
there's something special about Miss Liu.

212
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,300
These demons

213
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,460
valued her so much

214
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,580
and all ran after her.

215
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,260
I guess Ao Hen won't give up easily.

216
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,780
I need one more thing

217
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,620
to keep Miss Liu safe.

218
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Go get it.

219
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,300
Do we need to

220
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,180
say goodbye to Miss Liu?

221
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,660
No.

222
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,780
Is your daughter a noble person?

223
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,420
How dare she keep Mr. Du waiting?

224
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,690
She will be right here.

225
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,460
Have some tea.

226
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,570
This is the best Biluochun tea.

227
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,010
Father.

228
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:07,780
Father.

229
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,260
Is someone from the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke here?

230
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,340
Mr. Du,

231
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,060
this is my daughter, Liu Shao.

232
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,100
Liu Shao,

233
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,780
this is Mr. Du from the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

234
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,380
He is the first disciple of Wu Yang Duke.

235
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,500
Mr. Du.

236
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,740
You are Liu Shao?

237
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,620
Was Ao Hen

238
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,170
here for you?

239
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,260
Yes.

240
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,970
What on earth did you

241
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,540
offend her?

242
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,980
I didn't.

243
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,570
If you didn't,

244
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,380
why did the demon like Ao Hen

245
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,060
come here

246
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,380
and try to kill an ordinary person like you?

247
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,020
Mr. Du,

248
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,860
please be reasonable.

249
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,410
The murderer wanted to kill people

250
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,300
and brought disasters to the people.

251
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,660
It is the murderer who should be blamed.

252
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,660
Moreover,

253
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,020
I didn't offend her.

254
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,620
Even if I did,

255
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,980
do I deserve to be killed?

256
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,980
What do you mean?

257
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,180
Are you lecturing me?

258
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:53,940
-My lord. -I...

259
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,260
My lord.

260
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,700
My daughter has stayed at home for a long time. She didn't mean it.

261
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,220
Please forgive her.

262
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,900
Fine, you know the rules.

263
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,020
Mr. Du,

264
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,140
when can the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke catch

265
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,980
that big demon?

266
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,420
It's not easy

267
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,780
to catch such a big demon.

268
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,100
Okay.

269
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,940
I know

270
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,780
the situation here.

271
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,420
I will report it to my Lord.

272
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,180
How could you take the money and do nothing?

273
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,300
I thought you were a hero.

274
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,700
How dare you be rude to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

275
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,500
I won't argue with you

276
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,620
because of your father.

277
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,780
How dare you talk nonsense here?

278
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,260
Anyone who enters the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke

279
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,700
are the best.

280
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,940
The Mansion of Wu Yang Duke is the safest place

281
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,300
with the Protection Spell.

282
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
Can you go there?

283
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,900
Why not?

284
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,020
Listen.

285
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,700
I will walk into the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke

286
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,940
on my own.

287
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,260
Okay, I'll wait.

288
00:19:59,500 --> 00:19:59,700
Let's go.

289
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,300
My lord.

290
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,820
My lord.

291
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Don't be angry.

292
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,540
My lord, please don't be angry.

293
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,140
My lord.

294
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,740
He called himself the first disciple of the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

295
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,980
He is nothing.

296
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,020
I think

297
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,620
Mr. Lu is 100 times better than him.

298
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,980
Of course.

299
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,460
Does Mr. Lu who appeared in front of you

300
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,900
look like the immortal you saw?

301
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,340
My Lady.

302
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,460
My Lady.

303
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,820
What are you thinking about?

304
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,810
Actually, he does.

305
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,620
How about

306
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,460
we

307
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,860
go find him together?

308
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,620
My Lady,

309
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,980
I was just saying.

310
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,340
Are you really looking for him?

311
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
How could Mr. Lu be an immortal?

312
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,540
I think he is.

313
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,820
Otherwise, how could he save me at that time?

314
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,090
The immortal said

315
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,260
he would come back when I grow up.

316
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
Didn't you say

317
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,580
he does business at Moon River?

318
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,540
Where is he?

319
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,940
I just heard about it.

320
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,330
Desserts.

321
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,220
If Old Master finds out,

322
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,500
I will be doomed.

323
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,420
If Old Master finds out,

324
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,410
I will be doomed.

325
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,740
Can you say something else?

326
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,780
My Lady.

327
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,460
All right.

328
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,940
Let's go over there

329
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,660
and then we will go home.

330
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,890
Catch the moon.

331
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,460
Catch the moon.

332
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,740
Don't miss it.

333
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,540
Don't miss it.

334
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,740
Don't miss this opportunity.

335
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,660
He's over there.

336
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,420
My Lady.

337
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,020
You really don't know how good this deal is.

338
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,340
It's only one tael.

339
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,260
You can't lose anything.

340
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Wait for me.

341
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,220
Why are you here?

342
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,700
I'm going to catch the moon in the Moon River.

343
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,580
Are you going or not?

344
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,170
You must be Mr. Lu.

345
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,460
I've been looking for you.

346
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,330
Really?

347
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,820
Miss, why are you looking for me?

348
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,380
Because you saved me that day.

349
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,300
So today,

350
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,820
I'm here to thank you.

351
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,060
Where are you going?

352
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,860
I...

353
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,460
I'm going to catch the moon.

354
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,940
I only charge one tael.

355
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,220
Do you want to go with me?

356
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,540
Okay.

357
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,260
Let's go.

358
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,620
Let me ask you something.

359
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,580
Go ahead.

360
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,140
I have a friend.

361
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,220
She met an immortal ten years ago.

362
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,540
She said he descended from the sky

363
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,420
and brought her to fly to the sky.

364
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,140
You are well-informed.

365
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,340
Then,

366
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,900
have you seen an immortal before?

367
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,820
Your friend must have a dream.

368
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,300
I've only seen demons

369
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,220
with my master for these years.

370
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,700
All immortals are living in

371
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,620
the immortal world.

372
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,660
How can we meet them?

373
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,100
Maybe she had a dream.

374
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,020
Have you really never met an immortal?

375
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,940
Of course not.

376
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,930
If I can meet an immortal,

377
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,940
I'll let you know first,

378
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,780
okay?

379
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:40,900
By the way,

380
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,100
I don't know your name yet.

381
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,140
My name is Liu Shao.

382
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,940
Liu Shao?

383
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,180
The moon is on the tip of the willow.

384
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,420
That's a good name.

385
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,100
Didn't you say you want to catch the moon?

386
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,580
We're already on the moon.

387
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,180
Look.

388
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,380
Wow.

389
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,740
What a beautiful moon shadow!

390
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,980
I'm going to catch the moon.

391
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,140
Wait for me.

392
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,780
Okay.

393
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,380
Hello?

394
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,500
Are you okay?

395
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,700
Hello?

396
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,300
I don't want the moon, okay?

397
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,730
Don't scare me.

398
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,980
Come up.

399
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,660
I found you a treasure

400
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,340
and you don't want it?

401
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,340
No.

402
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,660
Come down.

403
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,020
Why are you

404
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,940
all dry?

405
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:55,940
Are you okay?

406
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,570
I know the Water-repellent Spell.

407
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,540
I'm fine.

408
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,820
You said you're not an immortal?

409
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
Stop pretending.

410
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,140
This is it?

411
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,420
Such a big clam shell.

412
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,340
Are you kidding me?

413
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
Of course not.

414
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,810
Close your eyes.

415
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,420
Close your eyes.

416
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,820
Close your eyes.

417
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,210
Okay. I can't see.

418
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,090
All right.

419
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,300
Look.

420
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,180
So beautiful.

421
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,540
Wow.

422
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,420
What a beautiful bracelet.

423
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,540
Isn't it pretty?

424
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,740
But what about the moon?

425
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,660
Didn't you tell me

426
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,180
to catch the moon in the Moon River?

427
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,500
Is it

428
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,420
this?

429
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,580
Look carefully.

430
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,660
You are now on the moon.

431
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,260
And there is the starry sky.

432
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,100
Your life

433
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,540
should be wonderful.

434
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,210
You will see mountains, rivers

435
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,420
and the stars of the four seas.

436
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,380
Is it beautiful?

437
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,460
Take it off.

438
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,380
What?

439
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,180
I'm just showing you.

440
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,340
I'm going to sell it.

441
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,980
Don't cheat.

442
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,660
Oh, right.

443
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,980
This bracelet is amazing.

444
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,180
If you want to sell it,

445
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,810
why don't you sell it to me?

446
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,460
Miss,

447
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,700
this bracelet is unusual.

448
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:44,980
This bracelet is made by

449
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,140
the Lake Demon's one eye

450
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,180
to raise her children.

451
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,220
It was formed in the golden clams.

452
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,860
It's very expensive.

453
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,380
Don't think about it.

454
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,540
But

455
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,020
the winter is coming.

456
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,740
I'll talk to them then.

457
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,940
Don't dig another eye

458
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,180
for their children.

459
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,420
I will take the bracelet.

460
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,020
I will take the other eye of them too.

461
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,740
Miss,

462
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,900
this bracelet

463
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,020
is at price of their lives.

464
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,780
The price

465
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,180
is not low.

466
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,060
2,000 taels.

467
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Miss, you...

468
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,090
5,000 taels.

469
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,300
That's the maximum I can afford.

470
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,340
Really.

471
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,660
That's all I got

472
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,820
this time.

473
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,740
Besides,

474
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,980
the money is with her.

475
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't have any.

476
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,340
Who?

477
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,330
Miss Xiaolian?

478
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,380
Yes.

479
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,530
The one on the shore?

480
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,820
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

481
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,660
It’s too late.

482
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,540
We can't keep her waiting.

483
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:48,930
By the way,

484
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,820
don't

485
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,180
take it off.

486
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,660
It can ward off evil spirits.

487
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,980
I'm back.

488
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,540
Master.

489
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,820
According to what you said,

490
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,180
I've given her the Lake Bracelet.

491
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,010
She was very happy.

492
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,340
She gave me some money.

493
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,330
I

494
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,820
bought you some good medicine.

495
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,700
It will definitely cure your cough.

496
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,140
How do you know

497
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,540
she would come to the Moon River to find me?

498
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,340
She also asked me about

499
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,100
the immortal.

500
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,740
However,

501
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
you told me

502
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,330
the IImmortal Palace

503
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,860
is no longer involved in mortal affairs.

504
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,060
They are all managed by the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

505
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,740
Judging from what she said,

506
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,500
maybe

507
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,180
she might have met the immortal.

508
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,620
Did you pretend to be an immortal

509
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,300
and cheat her?

510
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,050
Master.

511
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,420
Don't say that.

512
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,140
She came there herself.

513
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,620
I just took the opportunity.

514
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,380
You've prepared the Lake Bracelet

515
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,100
for ten years.

516
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,220
If you give it to her like this,

517
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,540
I have to sell her at a good price.

518
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,580
But Master,

519
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,340
why did you give her the Lake Bracelet?

520
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,820
You asked me

521
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,660
why Ao Hen came to Miss Liu.

522
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,540
Although she is a mortal,

523
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,220
she has strong spiritual power.

524
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,180
I don't know where she gets it.

525
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,180
[Jade Pavilion]

526
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,500
I just know

527
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,340
this power will awaken at her age of 18

528
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,420
and attract all demons.

529
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,420
With the protection of the Lake Bracelet,

530
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,940
ordinary demons

531
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,700
won't dare to approach her.

532
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,740
This bracelet can really ward off evil spirits.

533
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,820
After Ao Hen's attack this time,

534
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,100
she will definitely go to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke to hide.

535
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,500
With the Lake Bracelet,

536
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,770
she should be safe.

537
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,690
Master,

538
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,020
I think

539
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,380
you're unfair.

540
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,700
You arranged everything for this girl.

541
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,660
Please arrange something for me.

542
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,580
How about this?

543
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,410
I’m killing demons every day.

544
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,180
I can't rest for a day.

545
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,820
-And? -Okay.

546
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,500
Get rid of the scattered demons in the back mountain.

547
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,460
Gosh, I’m so tired.

548
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,420
How many demons am I going to hunt?

549
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,260
If I keep hunting like this, I'll never be able to finish it for the rest of my life.

550
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,300
I wonder if the girl has gone to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

551
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,980
How did you know I was going to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

552
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,660
You...

553
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,380
You...

554
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,300
How did you find me?

555
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,700
Why are you so nervous?

556
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,340
We are destined to meet.

557
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,740
We can meet everywhere.

558
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Am I right?

559
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,220
Oh no.

560
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,900
She's here to ask for money.

561
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,660
Why do you look like you did something wrong?

562
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,060
The bracelet you gave me

563
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,380
can really ward off evil spirits.

564
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,140
Of course.

565
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,140
It works.

566
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,660
This is the Lake Bracelet.

567
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,300
It's a good deal for 5,000 taels, okay?

568
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,050
Go to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke with me to learn.

569
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,740
I can add more money.

570
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,340
Why should I go to such a place

571
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,020
with a spoiled lady like you?

572
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,540
20,000 taels.

573
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,260
Are you going or not?

574
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,180
It's very tiring to go to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

575
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,660
25,000 taels.

576
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,540
Well,

577
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
you also know that

578
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,100
my master has a cough.

579
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,300
He needs me.

580
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,980
30,000 taels?

581
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,570
People in the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke

582
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,940
need to go out to catch demons.

583
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,220
My life will be in danger.

584
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,580
This cost is huge.

585
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,700
You must add 10,000 taels more.

586
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,540
Miss Liu,

587
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,860
I plan to

588
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,940
let Li go to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke with you tomorrow

589
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,780
to attend the recruitment competition tomorrow.

590
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,740
Okay.

591
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,660
Master,

592
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,620
if you want to arrange things for me,

593
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,620
can you come back a little later?

594
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,460
Wait until I negotiate the price.

595
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,180
Do you have a problem?

596
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:23,940
No.

597
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,700
Miss Liu,

598
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,020
please go back and rest.

599
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,500
Lu Li will pick you up tomorrow morning.

600
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,140
Mr. Lu, see you tomorrow.

601
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,020
I heard it with my own ears.

602
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,500
Liu Shao said she would leave tomorrow morning

603
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,860
to attend the recruitment competition

604
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
tomorrow.

605
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,980
Your Majesty.

606
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,860
Please spare me.

607
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,220
That's all I know.

608
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,770
I can keep investigating.

609
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,380
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

610
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,540
It seems

611
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,219
the tonic energy of Liu Shao

612
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,219
will be mine

613
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,580
soon.

614
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,690
Back then, I only killed a few people from the Immortal Palace.

615
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,900
Yin was badly injured by them.

616
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,460
Yin.

617
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,179
Yin, are you okay?

618
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,139
Yin.

619
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,620
You can't escape.

620
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,639
[Son of Ao Hen, Ao Yin]

621
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,380
Although we escaped,

622
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,580
my son was seriously injured

623
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,820
and returned to the infant state.

624
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,980
I will help you catch Liu Shao

625
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,580
and pass the power in her body to you.

626
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,460
Pass my order.

627
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,930
I want that girl

628
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,780
won't be able to enter the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

629
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,650
Master,

630
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,900
your steamed pear soup is ready.

631
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,540
You're ready to go?

632
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,890
Don't worry.

633
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,780
I can live wherever I go.

634
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,980
I'm always ready.

635
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,940
But Master,

636
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,460
why do you want me to go to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

637
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,900
Li,

638
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,140
do you remember

639
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,780
the Moon Sword I mentioned to you?

640
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:19,980
Yes.

641
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,060
I remember what you said.

642
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,260
As long as the Moon Sword is pulled out,

643
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,820
I will know who I am.

644
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,740
[Moon Sword]

645
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,700
Li.

646
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,740
The Moon Sword is actually in the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

647
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,620
Now that the Mysterious Light has appeared,

648
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,620
it means it's time.

649
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,020
You have to protect Liu Shao.

650
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,620
She's the key to pull out the Moon Sword.

651
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,140
Damn Lu Li!

652
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,980
He promised to pick me up, but where is he?

653
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,260
I can't wait for him.

654
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,060
I can't miss the recruitment.

655
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,620
What's that sound?

656
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,740
Are you also going to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke

657
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,060
for the competition?

658
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,380
-Yes. -Yes.

659
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,180
Yes, we are.

660
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:36,900
Let's go together.

661
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,660
-Sure. -Sure.

662
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,940
Please.

663
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,380
Okay.

664
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,090
I...

665
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,020
Where are they?

666
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,780
Where did the wind come from?

667
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,900
It's so sunny.

668
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,260
Why do I feel so cold on my back?

669
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,780
Aren't there many recruiters in the recruitment of the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

670
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,980
Why is there no one here?

671
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,540
[Mansion of Wu Yang Duke]

672
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,820
So this is the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

673
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,940
I'm here

674
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,060
without Lu Li.

675
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,020
-Miss, are you alright? -You...

676
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,500
Ignore her.

677
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,700
My name is Wang Jian.

678
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,980
I'm here to attend the competition.

679
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,650
Just like you.

680
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,940
My name is Liu Shao.

681
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,660
Let's do it.

682
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:01,820
Let's go.

683
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,500
What are you thinking?

684
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,380
He would have come if he wanted to.

685
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,540
Liu Shao.

686
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,460
Coming.

687
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,980
If fate is not over,

688
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,020
we will eventually meet.

689
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,540
I'll use these three days to verify

690
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,610
if you're the person I'm looking for.

691
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,540
This is unfair to you.

692
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,420
But this is the only way

693
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,980
to save the world.

694
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,020

has begun.

697
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,580
Unfortunately,

698
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,410
I can't see that day.

699
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,460
It's a plan for thousands of years.

700
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,060
Now it's time

701
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,300
to begin.

702
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,620
Master.

703
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,580
I had a dream.

704
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,780
I dreamed

705
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,100
I was flying with a girl in the sky.

706
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,620
Everything is just as the Supreme God said.

707
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,260
We've been waiting for ten thousand years.

708
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,860
Finally, everything is ready.

709
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,140
Master.

710
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,210
Where are you?

711
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,900
Master.
