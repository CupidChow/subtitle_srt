[Episode 07]

4
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,350
It's almost a month away.

5
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,110
I wonder if Lu Li has figured it out yet.

6
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,030
Senior Bai Feng.

7
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,390
Why are you here?

8
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,560
Why can't I be here?

9
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,510
I'm closer to Lu Li

10
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,870
than you think.

11
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,950
He's resting.

12
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,150
I don't think it's a good time for you

13
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,270
to go in there.

14
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,440
Liu Shao.

15
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,000
Everyone in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion knows that

16
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,630
you are in conflict with his spiritual power.

17
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,590
You were born to be

18
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,070
the malefic of his life.

19
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,950
Think about it.

20
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,430
You

21
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,750
only knows buy him off.

22
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,270
Once you're no longer useful,

23
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,270
he will not hesitate to leave you behind.

24
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,240
He's

25
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,760
such a cold and greedy man.

26
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,110
Senior.

27
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,780
Although Lu Li always

28
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,230
talks about money,

29
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,910
he wears the cheapest fabric,

30
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,310
and eats the cheapest food when he eats out.

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,460
He kept the money he had saved in his pocket

32
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,950
and was reluctant to spend it.

33
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,620
Although I don't know

34
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,260
why he hides

35
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,790
his true self,

36
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,270
my father told me

37
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,400
you can't judge a man

38
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,990
by his appearance. You need to see his heart.

39
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,430
So I trust him.

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,829
I don't believe he's the man you say he is.

41
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,270
I can't believe Liu Shao would defend me like that.

42
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,000
Silly girl.

43
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,710
I'm looking out for you here.

44
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,110
If something goes wrong,

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,470
don't blame me for not warning you.

46
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,910
I appreciate your efforts.

47
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,240
I still remember the time

48
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,230
when you brought Du Mingchong to the Pearl Pavilion

49
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,240
and put a sword around my neck.

50
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,829
Liu Shao trusts me.

51
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,510
I can't let her down.

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,110
I must help her find the King Herb as soon as possible.

53
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,709
Liu Shao.

54
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,000
What happened?

55
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,110
You don't want to find the King Herb?

56
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,430
You've figured it out?

57
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,070
Well, it's not really a solution.

58
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,240
But at this time,

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,320
we can only go to the Pearl Pavilion to find him,

60
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,950
to use some

61
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,310
very unusual measures.

You kicked me?

65

Don't move.

68

Master of Herbs, right?

69
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,830
You let us play with you every day, right?

70
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,700
And you won't tell us

71
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,040
how to grow the King Herb, right?

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,470
Right?

73
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,909
Now,

74
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,909
I give you two choices.

75
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,550
Two choices.

76
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,590
First.

77
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,580
First.

78
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,310

79
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,840
First.

80

First.

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,330
Give us the King Herb.

82
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,909
King Herb.

83
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,800
Second.

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,690
Second.

85

Can you stop talking?

86
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,670
Okay.

87
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,670
Well, second.

88
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,750
Give us the King Herb.

89
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,870
Give us the King Herb.

90
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,760
Otherwise...

to keep you alive

94
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,800
and give us the King Herb.

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,190
That's right.

96
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,760

do this to me?

103
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm telling you.

104
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,510
You can't

105
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,030
get spiritual power

106
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,390
from eating the King Herb.

107
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,560
I've lived in the Pearl Pavilion

108
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,790
for thousands of years.

109
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,540
I don't bow down to anyone.

110
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,850
Eat, eat as you please!

111
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,510
Choke you to death!

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,830
He's a little arrogant?

113
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,880
And he doesn't bow his head?

114
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,590
Liu Shao.

115
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:12,990
Come on.

116
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,110
Come on.

117
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,550
You! You! What are you doing?

118
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,430
What are you doing?

119
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,720
Take a guess. Don't move.

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,520
Behave yourself.

121
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,909
Give it back to me!

122
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,870
This hairpin looks familiar.

123
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,750
Remember?

124
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,710
This is the one

125
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,870
from the portrait in the "Magic Plant Code".

126
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,750
Right.

127
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,820
The beauty in the painting

128
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,940
wore

129
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,270
this hairpin.

130
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,310
Was she right, master?

131
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,480
I'm telling you.

132
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,000
How dare you two do this to me?

133
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,550
If there's any damage to this hairpin,

134
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,510
I'll keep you from seeing the sun tomorrow.

135
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,630
Is he really angry?

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,980
Master,

137
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,710
actually,

138
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,350
we don't want to push you like this, okay?

139
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,390
We couldn't help it.

140
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,470
We're at the end of our tether.

141
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,750
If we can't find the King Herb,

142
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,320
you really want Liu Shao out

143
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
to feed the demons?

144
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,169
Yes, I can't beat Ao Hen.

145
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,789
And I can't run away.

146
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,990
You can't just

147
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,559
let this happen.

148
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,670
Actually, there're some things

149
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,840
that you can't do with your best efforts.

150
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,710
For example?

151
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,110
For example,

152
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,990
if you can help me out of the Pearl Pavilion,

153
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,870
I'll give you the King Herb.

154
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,590
What do you think?

155
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,590
That's it?

156
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,270
Deal.

157
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,340
But you have to let us know

158
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,470
how you got in here, right?

159
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,830
It happened

160
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,630
because I was too kind.

161
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,010
A thousand years ago,

162
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,230
I was bored, so I came to the mortal world.

163
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,150
There was nothing interesting.

164
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,590
And I saw her in the moonlight.

165
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,030
She seemed to have something on her mind.

166
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,870
This scene caught my eye at once.

167
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,590
Miss!

168
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,390
Miss. Miss.

169
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,870
Miss, wake up.

170
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,560
Miss.

171
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,510
Miss.

172
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,110
Wake up.

173
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,790
Miss.

174
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,550
Why do you want to die?

175
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,310
You want to know?

176
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,750
You can meet me at the Pearl Pavilion

177
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,590
between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.

178
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,470
I'll tell you my story.

179
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,270
Pearl Pavilion?

180
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,710
By the way,

181
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,870
my name is Ling Xueyang.

182
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,680
Ling Xueyang?

183
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,070
This girl is so pretty.

184
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,150
And she has a nice name, too.

185
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,950
Looks like heaven really heard my call.

186
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,830
I not only met interesting things,

187
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,070
but also interesting people.

188
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,190
How can you be smiling?

189
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,190
Of course I can.

190
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,950
That was a hero saving the beauty,

191
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,470
beautiful as a fairy tale.

192
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,390
According to legend,

193
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,070
there was

194
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,900
a very outstanding female Marquis Wuyang,

195
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,670
named Ling Xueyang.

196
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,350
Marquis Wuyang

197
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,830
jumped into the river and killed herself?

198
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,720
And she happened to be saved

199
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,680
by you?

200
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,040
So what?

201
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,910
Anyway,

202
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,630
this... this... this was a good start!

203
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,260
Okay, okay, okay.

204
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,750
Have a seat.

205
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Okay, okay, okay.

206
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,480
A good start.

207
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,390
Did you go on your date?

208
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:13,950
Did you?

209
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,590
Of course.

210
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,430
But it didn't occur to me that

211
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,400
I wouldn't be able to come back.

212
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,350
Ling Xueyang, I'm coming!

213
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,880
Ling Xueyang.

214
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,750
What do you mean?

215
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,190
By the way,

216
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,030
I,

217
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,230
Ling Xueyang,

218
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,820
[Ling Xueyang, female Marquis Wuyang]

219
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,080
am the current Marquis Wuyang,

220
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,190
the Lord of the human world.

221
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,230
Marquis Wuyang?

222
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,390
So throwing yourself in the lake and killing yourself

223
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,910
were deliberate attempts to get close to me?

224
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,550
What exactly do you want to do?

225
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,550
I want your King Herb.

226
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,720
I don't have.

227
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,880
If not,

228
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,110
you can stay.

229
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,630
I don't care.

230
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,640
Let's see which one of us can outlive the other.

231
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,480
But you can't stew me.

232
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,630
In this way,

233
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,590
I was left by Xueyang in the Pearl Pavilion.

234
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,560
[Pearl Pavilion]

235
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,710
She spent her days at the pavilion reading papers

236
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,830
and dealing with official business.

237
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,790
She didn't even look at me.

238
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,950
I was bored

239
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,480
with her every day.

240
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,720
So I couldn't help teasing her.

241
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,320
She ignored me

242
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,910
and was not angry.

243
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,590
Gradually,

244
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,750
I got used to the Pearl Pavilion,

245
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,230
and got used to be with her every day.

246
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,110
Until one night,

247
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,950
I woke up and didn't see her.

248
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,630
For thousands of years of loneliness,

249
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,590
I felt this warmth for the first time.

250
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,280
I don't know since when

251
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,350
I looked forward to seeing her every second of the day,

252
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,390
accompanying her.

253
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,400
She was still cold

254
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,880
and unsmiling.

255
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,240
But gradually we began to care about each other.

256
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,920
My life

257
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,440
had never been so peaceful

258
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,630
and happy.

259
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,630
Because of her,

260
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,120
I became a real person,

261
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,750
not just a herb.

262
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,390
And then what happened?

263
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,070
She died?

264
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,380
Hey.

265
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,150
Watch your mouth.

266
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,480
Okay, okay, okay.

267
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,360
Our master

268
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,390
just took advantage of his long life.

269
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,910
Was she dead?

270
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,150
How can you talk this way?

271
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,950
Actually,

272
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,270
I'm worried that

273
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,430
mortal life is too short.

274
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,750
I was ready to give her the herb.

275
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,870
Do you know

276
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,950
why I want your herb?

277
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,150
Because I want to draw the Moon Sword.

278
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,510
I want the greatest power in the world.

279
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,440
I want mortals

280
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,990
to live righteously between heaven and earth,

281
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,240
no longer be bullied by demons

282
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,950
and no longer be restrained by immortals.

283
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,080
And we wouldn't be like this.

284
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,310
Without the help of immortals,

285
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,120
I can't even deal with a drought-causing monster.

286
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,310
At that moment,

287
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,350
I wanted to give her the King Herb

288
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,990
to reassure her.

289
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,940
But

290
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,350
I hesitated.

291
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,590
This moment of hesitation

292
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,350
has become our eternal farewell.

293
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,470
Don't open it until I leave.

294
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,710
And then?

295
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,390
What happened?

296
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,790
Legend has it that

297
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,640
Ling Xueyang died with that monster

298
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,430
in the great war.

299
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,069
It snowed for three days.

300
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,470
And the people wept for her for three days.

301
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,390
According to historical records,

302
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,240
heaven pitied her love for the people,

303
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,030
so it snowed for three days for her funeral.

304
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,000
If only I had given her the herb

305
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,160
and helped her draw the Moon Sword.

306
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,910
Master,

307
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,280
don't be sad.

308
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,030
Yes.

309
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,830
I'm sure Ling Xueyang would hate to see you like this.

310
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,790
Let's go.

311
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,390
Let's leave him alone.

312
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,990
Let's not push him.

313
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,950
I didn't expect him to live 10,000 years

314
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,960
and still have a past like this.

315
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,560
Even if he doesn't give us the herb,

316
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,830
let's get him out.

317
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:35,990
Liu Shao.

318
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,830
Did you ever wonder

319
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,150
why Ling Xueyang gave him that hairpin?

320
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,110
Did Ling Xueyang feel that she could't come back,

321
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,590
so she used this to show her heart?

322
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,670
It's possible.

323
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,030
But I don't think that's what she meant.

324
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,680
The hairpin may have something to do with the boundary.

325
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,510
Ling Xueyang knew she was going to die.

326
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,260
How could she

327
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,910
keep her sweetheart imprisoned for thousands of years?

328
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,880
But this hairpin

329
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,630
was supposed to be the only memento

330
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,440
of Ling Xueyang.

331
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,350
Even if we get him out,

332
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,720
it's not gonna help.

333
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,550
What really held him back

334
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,630
was his feelings for Ling Xueyang.

335
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,430
So,

336
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,590
we don't have much chance of getting the herb, do we?

337
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,150
Lu Li.

338
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,390
If I get kicked out,

339
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,750
will you stand with me

340
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,470
to face Ao Hen?

341
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,910
I don't know how far I can go with you.

342
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,270
But I will do my best

343
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,830
to accompany you to go on.

344
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,390
Liu Shao.

345
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,150
I can actually relate to Ling Xueyang now,

346
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,830
drawing the Moon Sword

347
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,350
to get strong power,

348
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,310
so you can protect the people you're trying to protect.

349
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,230
From now on,

350
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,550
I'll stand with you in the face of anyone

351
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,710
and anything.

352
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,990
I hope one day

353
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,510
I can be strong enough to protect you

354
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,350
from anyone and anything.

355
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,670
Lu Li.

356
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,080
Thank you.

357
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,390
Ao Hen!

358
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,630
Come out!

359
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,590
You don't look like a daredevil.

360
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,070
Don't you dare come and yell at me.

361
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,150
I see

362
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,680
you've figured it out.

363
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,510
Ao Hen,

364
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,630
I want to make a deal with you.

365
00:21:59,380 --> 00:21:59,990
Will you?

366
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,050
You?

367
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,470
What qualifications do you have

368
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,670
to make this deal with me?

369
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,920
I'm certainly no match for you

370
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,390
in strength.

371
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,520
But I know you've been chasing someone.

372
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,190
I can help you get Liu Shao.

373
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,950
Okay.

374
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,070
I wonder

375
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,630
what you

376
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,510
really want.

377
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,910
I want to be strong,

378
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,310
like you.

379
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,800
Tell me

380
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,840
how strong I am.

381
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,630
You can ask for anything you want,

382
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,990
without asking anyone

383
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,870
and caring whether he agrees or not.

384
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,470
All right.

385
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,170
I'll grant your request.

386
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,350
Tell me.

387
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,710
What exactly do you want?

388
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,100
Every year, banishing demons on the Double Ninth Festival

389
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,630
is a top priority in the mansion.

390
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,830
The weather is dry these days

391
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,630
and it's easy to catch fire.

392
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,190
Be careful, all of you.

393
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,720
No place in this mansion

394
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,470
can be left behind.

395
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,510
Yes.

396
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,310
Wang Jian.

397
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:18,870
Come here.

398
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,510
Why isn't Lu Li here again?

399
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,770
What did he do

400
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,550
while we were busy?

401
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,720
Does he have eyes for me?

402
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,000
Senior, calm down.

403
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,690
The Lord and Captain Fang

404
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,670
went to Moon Washing Pond to check out the demon realm.

405
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,080
Senior Lu Li

406
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,720
was so busy patrolling the place

407
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,150
and trying to get hold of the herb

408
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,550
that he really had his hands full.

409
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,870
Can he really get that King Herb?

410
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,590
He already has a clue.

411
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,470
Now it's just a matter of when he gets it.

412
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,190
You may leave.

413
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,150
Senior Du,

414
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,550
what I promised

415
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,110
will be done.

416
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,630
It's just that if you cover it up like this,

417
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,950
it makes people suspicious.

418
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,590
Bai Feng.

419
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,000
Is it accurate that

420
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,350
there's an immortal herb that has grown fine for thousands of years

421
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,670
in the Pearl Pavilion?

422
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,960
I hope it doesn't backfire.

423
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,230
I don't want it to affect our future in the mansion.

424
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,430
Senior Du.

425
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,370
Today's Marquis Wuyang practiced martial arts at the age of three,

426
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,310
and achieved enlightenment at the age of ten.

427
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,880
He defended justice with a three-foot sword.

428
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,660
He was chosen to be the Lord

429
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,470
at the age of 16 by the former Marquis Wuyang.

430
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,160
In order to be strong,

431
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,230
he would

432
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,550
stop at nothing.

433
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,630
I thought

434
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,870
you would be a lot like the master,

435
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,790
resourceful and courageous.

436
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,070
Now,

437
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,830
why have you become so timid?

438
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,320
How can I not believe what you say?

439
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,830
It's just that this is very important,

440
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,310
and I want to be discreet.

441
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,460
Who would have thought that

442
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,410
such a secret could be hidden

443
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,710
in that deserted Pearl Pavilion?

444
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,870
It's a good thing you told me before.

445
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,270
Otherwise, if Lu Li offers the King Herb,

446
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,860
I'm afraid

447
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,800
there's no place for me in this mansion.

448
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,360
I'm glad you understand.

449
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,460
I will do the rest myself.

450
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,040
All you need to do is

451
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,920
distract brothers and sisters from the Pearl Pavilion.

452
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,030
If it works, you can take the credit.

453
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,390
If it fails,

454
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,680
I won't drag you down.

455
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,440
I do appreciate your efforts.

456
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,430
When I control Marquis Wuyang's Mansion,

457
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,320
I'll repay you.

458
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,550
Well, I got to go.

459
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,270
I'd like to ask you to borrow some demon fire,

460
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,230
which can burn for seven days.

461
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,590
Okay.

462
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,950
I'll give it to you.

463
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,950
This demon fire only burns living things.

464
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,830
And it won't burn out.

465
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,110
Make good use of it.

466
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,270
Liu Shao!

467
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,790
Senior Bai Feng.

468
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,370
Usually,

469
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,990
you are responsible for cleaning the Pearl Pavilion.

470
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,670
Then you're gonna have to

471
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,950
take care of these demon-banishing lights.

472
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,310
Yes.

473
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,430
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

474
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,150
I have to be more careful.

475
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,800
But...

476
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,070
Not many people go to the Pearl Pavilion normally.

477
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,630
Do we need so many lights?

478
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,950
Because no one usually goes there.

479
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,320
What if some demons

480
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,110
go in there?

481
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,600
Junior Liu Shao.

482
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,160
Am I right?

483
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,870
Yes, you're right.

484
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,670
I'll go.

485
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,470
Master!

486
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,710
Master!

487
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,420
We're not going to ask you for the herb anymore.

488
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,790
You need to stop avoiding me.

489
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,750
Come out!

490
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,550
All right.

491
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,100
I'll clean up

492
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,270
and leave you alone.

493
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,630
Girl, why don't you eat?

494
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,620
Is your nose not working

495
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,230
or these osmanthus cakes aren't sweet?

496
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,030
Because I want to eat with you.

497
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,540
Little girl,

498
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,640
since when do you have a conscience?

499
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,150
What happened?

500
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,620
This year's demon-banishing,

501
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,910
you even counted the Pearl Pavilion?

502
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,430
When I do the math,

503
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,990
no one has visited the Pearl Pavilion

504
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,230
for nearly a century.

505
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,560
Master, you mean

506
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,230
they didn't come to the Pearl Pavilion in the past?

507
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,790
No, no, no.

508
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,390
I scared them off when they got here.

509
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,110
I don't know what's going on this year,

510
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,470
with all these demon-banishing lights.

511
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:49,840
What's wrong?

512
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,700
Aren't you the one who laid them out?

513
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,590
Is there a problem?

514
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,110
Demon fire! Run! Run!

515
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,190
Xue.

516
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,230
Where is Liu Shao?

517
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,780
Senior Bai Feng asked her

518
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,380
to lay out the demon-banishing lights in the Pearl Pavilion.

519
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,070
She's still not back.

520
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,240
Bai Feng?

521
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,790
How long has she been gone?

522
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,310
Seems like a few hours ago.

523
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,150
Fire!

524
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,990
Fire!

525
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,240
The Pearl Pavilion is on fire!

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,800
Get some water.

527
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,500
The Pearl Pavilion is on fire.

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,300
Hurry up. Hurry up.

529
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,030
Put out the fire.

530
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,050
Why can't this fire go out?

531
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,500
This demon fire was enchanted.

532
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,540
Once it burns, water can't put it out. The fire will burn for seven days.

-Here, give it to me! -Get some more water.

544
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,830
No, we need to find a way out of here.

545
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,390
Or we'll be consumed by the demon fire.

546
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,760
It doesn't work.

547
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,010
Look at the aperture on the roof.

548
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,660
The demon fire

549
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,030
attached to the boundary of the Pearl Pavilion.

550
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,070
There's no way a living thing can escape.

551
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,840
What are we gonna do?

552
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:44,990
Girl!

553
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,360
I'll use my psychic powers

554
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,570
to help you fight your way out.

555
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,180
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

556
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,910
What about you?

557
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,800
Just leave me alone.

558
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,710
I can't get out.

559
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,220
Even if I can stop the fire,

560
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,470
I can't get out of here.

561
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,500
But you are different.

562
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,310
You still have a chance.

What are you doing?

564
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,870
Senior Xueyang gave you this hairpin

565
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,300
because

566
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,150
this is the key to unlock the boundary of the Pearl Pavilion.

567
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,400
You already knew that, didn't you?

568
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,710
Give it back to me!

569
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,600
If she were alive,

570
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,790
she wouldn't need you to do this.

571
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,320
But she's gone.

572

She's gone!

573
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,100
This hairpin is all I have.

You're gonna take it away, too?

I can't live without it.

00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,180
The grass demon

694
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,110
disappeared after the fire.

695
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,750
My guess is that

696
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,190
he was trapped in the Pearl Pavilion.

697
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,450
He wanted to escape,

698
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,150
so he started the fire.

699
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,070
Junior Bai's inference made perfect sense.

700
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:03,990
I

701
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,390
think so too.

702
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Shameless.

703
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,450
I heard

704
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,510
that the grass demon and Liu Shao are very personal friends.

705
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,340
When he left,

706
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,030
he had handed over the King Herb to Junior Liu Shao.

707
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,430
Liu Shao.

708
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,620
Liu Shao did get the herb.

709
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,790
She's waiting for Your Majesty to come back and present it.

710
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,670
She got it?

711
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,340
Liu Shao is so amazing.

712
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,320
She's not the average person.

713
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,040
It really is the King Herb.

714
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,070
It seems that heaven is not gonna kill me and there's a way out.

715
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,070
Liu Shao.

716
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,270
This time,

717
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,590
you've done a great job.

718
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,270
What about the demon fire?

719
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,740
Now that you've got the herb,

720
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,030
you redeemed yourselves.

721
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,640
I will let go of the burning of the Pearl Pavilion.
