00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,070
he can do the right thing,

178
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,400
be on the right path,

179
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,990
and become

180
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,070
the future Marquis Wuyang.

181
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,560
After all, he is the son of your old friend.

182
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,270
What a pity.

183
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,360
But

184
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,670
Lu Li...

185
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,190
Master.

186
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,710
Feng.

187
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,070
Why are you back?

188
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,940
I thought

189
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,110
you've been suffering a cough.

190
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,290
In the past,

191
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,350
my junior fellow was here looking after you.

192
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,830
Now,

193
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,750
he has gone to Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

194
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,320
I was afraid that you would be left alone,

195
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,790
so I brought some herbal medicines.

196
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,910
The Chuanbei herb-pear juice

197
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,350
was bought by him, right?

198
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,870
He's meddlesome.

199
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,350
I'm used to it.

200
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,750
How is Li?

201
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,190
Not bad.

202
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,550
He went through a lot with Liu Shao.

203
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,630
After all, Liu Shao is a spoiled young lady.

204
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,150
She's new to the Marquis' Mansion.

205
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,590
Li should help him from time to time.

206
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,510
With his guidance,

207
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,560
Liu Shao's cultivation has improved a lot.

208
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,990
Did he ever mention the Moon Sword?

209
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,630
Well,

210
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,060
maybe he's been too busy with helping Liu Shao,

211
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,630
and had no time to care about the Moon Sword.

212
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,900
You mean

213
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,590
he only cares about Liu Shao

214
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,460
and hasn't kept mind

215
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,790
on what I told him to do?

216
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,580
No, Master.

217
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,040
The Moon Sword is so important.

218
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,750
He will remember it.

219

[Marquis Wuyang's Mansion]

220
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,800
Brother.

221
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,910
I'm ready.

222
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,280
For what?

223
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,710
We should share weal and woe together.

224
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,670
How can we let you be punished alone?

225
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,550
Such a good boy.

226
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,430
But think about it.

227
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,930
If you share the woe with me,

228
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,160
then Xue also has to suffer together with us.

229
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,150
She just recovered.

230
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,390
Don't you care about her?

231
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,990
Care about her?

232
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,670
No.

233
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,590
Wait, it seems that I care about her.

234
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,180
Besides, Liu Shao will go with me.

235
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,580
You two don't have to worry about it.

236
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,790
You're injured. I'm worried about you.

237
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,590
I'm worried about you too.

238
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,710
Tell me, do you think I look good?

239
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,390
Actually...

240
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,510
Actually,

241
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,470
you also think I look good,

242
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,040
right?

243
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,920
Master?

244
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,660
Master.

245
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,190
Why are you here?

246
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,830
I heard that you'd been busy lately.

247
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,470
So I came to see you.

248
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,750
Actually,

249
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,990
I'm fine.

250
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,820
The Demon King in White

251
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,920
sneaked into Marquis Wuyang's Mansion,

252
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,120
so I was thinking about

253
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,140
how to get the King Herb back

254
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,180
from him.

255
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,410
Was it for the King Herb,

256
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,990
or for Liu Shao?

257
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,730
Master.

258
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,330
We took so much money from her.

259
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,770
If she is in danger,

260
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,350
we have to protect her, don't we?

261
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,480
You kept no mind on the tasks I gave you, did you?

262
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,390
Instead, you care so much about this girl!

263
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,510
I remember you hated her.

264
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,430
You didn't even want to come with her.

265
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,030
Actually,

266
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,430
after getting along with her,

267
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,840
I found that

268
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,390
she's ctually

269
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,630
not that spoiled.

270
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,560
She's hardworking,

271
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,660
and sincere.

272
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,630
Master,

273
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,520
she's not good-for-nothing.

274
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,260
Have you gotten enamoured with her?

275
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,590
No.

276
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,950
How could it be?

277
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,030
Master

278
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,710
doesn't want me to be with her?

279
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,270
You can't be together.

280
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,670
Why?

281
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,910
Master, you don't like her?

282
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,470
So you asked me to approach her

283
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,470
just because she can help me draw the Moon Sword?

284
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,000
It doesn't matter if I like her or not.

285
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,220
You should know her spirit fire

286
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,510
is incompatible with yours.

287
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,190
You know it.

288
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,870
I don't need to explain.

289
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,200
You can only get each other restrained

290
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,430
and impaired.

291
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,750
Your fate is also in opposition.

292
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,870
You're destined to get each other impaired.

293
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,910
Your love for each other

294
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,030
can only get both of you harmed.

295
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,030
You wanted to know where you were from,

296
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,230
and that was why I asked you to enter Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

297
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,960
It was for making you draw the Moon Sword,

298
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,150
not for letting you fall in love.

299
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,950
This is called "Soul-Devouring Spell".

300
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,860
I planted it in your body.

301
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,640
As long as you have any affection for Liu Shao,

302
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,670
the spell will get stimulated,

303
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,900
and break out from your heart and mouth.

304
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,430
If you don't draw back from loving Liu Shao,

305
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,990
the spell will run through your body along with your vitality,

306
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,260
making your blood vessels burst apart

307
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,670
and bringing you the intolerable pain.

308
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,470
When the spell returns back to your palms,

309
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
you absolutely will die.

310
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,720
You'd better do yourself a favor!

311
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,510
I don't need a useless disciple.

312
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,030
What is Lu Li doing?

313
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,460
Why isn't he here yet?

315
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,100
Lu Li, what were you doing?

316
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,290
What took you so long?

317
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,270
I was thinking about

318
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,820
getting the King Herb as soon as possible.

319
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,600
Then one day, if I leave,

320
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,040
you can have a foothold in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion when being alone.

321
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,290
What?

322
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
You're leaving?

Don't worry.

324
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,290
I'm not leaving.

You...

326
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,460
You

327
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,030
took my money.

328
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,350
If you leave, you have to compensate me.

329
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,170
Ten times the price.

330
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,380
No, 100 times.

331
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,830
I can't afford to it.

332
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,760
Then you're not allowed to leave.

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,470
I'm just a servant.

350
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,190
I don't know what My Lord did.

351
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,260
Don't give him a hard time.

352
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,230
Get to work.

353
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,520
Let's go.

354
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:50,780
Hey!

355
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,290
Why? Why?

356
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,510
Why? Why?

357
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,380
Why

358
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,100
should I take so much,

359
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,990
while he's taking nothing?

360
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,140
Are you done?

361
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,770
Yes.

362
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,110
Get back to work.

363
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,300
Leave the basin.

364
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,680
Although this place is old,

365
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,820
it's with archaic beauty.

366
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,760
You little demon,

367
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,440
can you stop flirting?

368
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,160
Go clean up.

369
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,530
Over there.

370
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,760
See? It's dirty over there.

371
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,480
Clean it up.

372
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,270
Hurry.

373
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,120
Is he capable of that?

374
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,540
He's just a fish,

375
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,580
not the Demon King.

376
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,640
Even Miss Liu can manage it.

377
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,780
How can Miss Liu's demon be incapable of it?

378
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,880
What do you think?

379
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,270
Mr. Lu is right.

380
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,580
Don't bully honest people.

381
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:41,770
Me?

382
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,860
Who is the honest one?

383
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,380
Don't bully my demon.

384
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,830
Stop looking!

385
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,970
I'll beat you.

386
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,140
Get back to work.

387
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,050
Damn fish demon!

388
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,810
Fish Demon, you did it on purpose!

389
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,160
You were fooling me!

390
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,630
I didn't mean it.

391
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,690
I'm cleaning.

392
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,110
Come on.

393
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,370
Let me help you put the books in order.

394
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:20,900
Mr. Lu,

395
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,940
books shouldn't be placed like this.

396
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,870
Demon King in White,

397
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,240
don't think I fear you.

398
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,680
If you don't stop acting recklessly,

399
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,340
Miss Liu Shao will punish you.

400
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,990
Here you go!

401
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,970
Stop fighting!

402
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,310
Stop!

403
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,900
What are you doing?

404
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,940
Are you two trying to rebel?

405
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,170
Look at what you've done.

406
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,400
He started the fight.

407
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,920
The broom started it.

408
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,130
What are you talking about?

409
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,310
Stop arguing. Just think about how to clean it up.

410
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,420
Or I'll make you into sugar-stewed pear juice.

411
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,100
And you.

412
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,960
I'll chop you

413
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,010
into fillets

414
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,840
for stewing pickles.

415
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,600
Unfortunately, I'm not a real pear.

416
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,860
I wonder if this guy in front of us

417
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,700
is a real carp.

418
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,620
It was my fault.

420
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,060
Of course it was your fault.

421
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,670
Can't you stop arguing?

422
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,060
Look at these books.

423
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,320
We need to get them sorted out

424
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,380
and put back in order.

425
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,230
Can we make it in a month?

426
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,120
This is...

427
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,260
You cast the spell?

428
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,360
You cast it?

429
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,870
Is this book a demon too?

430
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,520
It can get itself sorted.

431
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,700
I heard

432
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,590
there was an ancient book from the Immortal Palace left in the mortal world.

433
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,720
It's called "Magic Plant Code".

434
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,190
It's a rare magic weapon.

435
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,420
With the Code, any plants in the Three Realms can be cultivated.

436
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,780
Any plants?

437
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,080
Including the King Herb?

438
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,380
That's right.

439
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,020
I know what to do!

440
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,770
[Fairyland in the Code]

441
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,060
It's so lively.

442
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,260
I think

443
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,730
this must be the world in the Code.

444
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,080
I think so.

445
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,900
Little demon.

446
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,170
What do you think

447
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,290
about this?

448
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,560
At least the things here

449
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,650
should be real.

450
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,880
I wonder if there's a herbal medicine shop here.

451
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,300
I hope we can find the King Herb.

452
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,400
We have to find it anyway.

453
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,790
Why don't we wander around and look for it?

454
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:24,880
Let's go.

455
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
I'll try something else.

456
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,970
Try some.

457
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,790
It looks delicious.

458
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,850
How much is this?

459
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,950
"Grasswort picked for half a day can't fill up the basket,

460
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,870
I missed my husband so much and left the basket on the road."

461
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,950
["Grasswort picked for half a day can't fill up the basket, I missed my husband so much and left the basket on the road."]

462
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,060
Let me tell you.

463
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,490
Such vendors who can read poems

464
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,640
will surely ask for a high price.

465
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,520
Let me deal with it.

466
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,260
You illiteratus.

467
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,380
You're unlearned.

468
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,900
How dare you insult me

469
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,980
with money!

470
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,100
You are not welcomed here.

471
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,960
Leave here, Miss.

472
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,590
Just leave.

473
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,140
-This isn't money. -Leave here.

474
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
-It's a golden leaf. -You're not welcomed here.

475
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,940
I don't want you to be my customer.

476
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,370
It's golden.

477
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,390
Enough.

478
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,000
-Ignorant girl. -Let's go.

479
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,190
What does he mean?

480
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,330
He thinks we are illiterate.

481
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,170
-What? -Let's go.

482
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,090
Stop it.

483
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,600
Here you are.

484
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,150
Cotton candy!

485
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,360
How much is this?

486
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,300
It's free.

487
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,050
Everything here is free.

488
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,320
Free?

489
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,900
This world in the Code respect talent and knowledge most.

490
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,950
["Let's pick plantains, let's get plantains."]

491
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,670
As long as you can tell the ingredients indicated by the poems,

492
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,940
you'll get what are sold.

493
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,610
"Grasswort picked for half a day can't fill up the basket,

494
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,410
I missed my husband so much and left the basket on the road."

495
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,230
Grasswort,

496
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,700
the sprout of the Xanthium,

497
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,750
can cure cold and headache.

498
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,780
Impressive!

499
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,810
Such a talent. If you want anything,

500
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,520
just take it.

501
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,680
Have a taste.

502
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,360
It's delicious.

503
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,230
I won't let you win...

504
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,200
It's just to recognize plants.

505
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,340
What's so hard about it?

506
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,580
"Let's pick plantains,

507
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,600
let's get plantains."

508
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,950
This is it.

509
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:42,920
Here you are.

510
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,640
["Grasswort picked for half a day can't fill up the basket, I missed my husband so much and left the basket on the road."]

511
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,580
That's easy.

512
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,260
Mr. Lu is indeed knowledgeable.

513
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,890
You even know this herb!

514
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,710
Grass named "Carefree".

515
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,670
It's Carefree Grass.

516
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,510
I can't lose to him.

517

["Let's pick plantains, let's get plantains."]

518

"Zhaoyan" [flower],

519
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,270
it blooms at dawn and withers at dusk.

520
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,700
Let's go.

["I climed up the hill and collected fritilaries to drive away my sadness; women are sentimental but also have their principles."]

522
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,770
Chickweed.

523
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,570
Indigofera.

524
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,330
Xu Changqing!

525
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,670
This old demon...

526
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,850
He's so proud of his living a few hundred years longer than me

527
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,730
and reading a few more books than me.

528
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,490
Shameless!

529
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,220
If you're angry about it,

530
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,060
then read more books.

531
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,010
This place is really special.

532
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,450
Neither money nor martial arts are pursued.

533
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,670
Only knowledge is highly valued.

534
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,480
People here must be interesting.

535
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,240
Even you don't know it?

536
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,230
Here you are.

537
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,100
The character "蝱" in the poem

538
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,530
refers to the fritillary grass, right?

539
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,490
Yes.

540
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,310
This plant name is rarely-seen.

541
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,400
How did you come to know it?

542
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,290
My master has a cough.

543
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,670
He always eats this.

544
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,160
There's really someone able to pass the test of the spirit fire.

545
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,140
The one who obtained the spirit fire

546
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,240
is the female disciple of our sect, Liu Shao.

547
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,960
The one who brought the spirit fire out

548
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,890
was another disciple, Lu Li.

549
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,080
Liu Shao, Lu Li?

550
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,800
Yes.

551
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,810
Unfortunately,

552
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,660
they haven't

553
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,420
brought back the King Herb yet.

554
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,360
The demons are rampant in the Three Realms now.

555
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,380
I lost eighty percent of my power

556
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,440
because of saving Lu Li.

557
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,660
If a powerful demon attacks,

558
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,060
I'm afraid I won't be able to repel the enemy.

559
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,240
Immortal Master,

560
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,510
the spiritual power of Liu Shao is abnormal.

561
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,390
I'm thinking

562
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,620
if we can use her power

563
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,400
to eliminate the demons in the mortal world?

564
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,970
Don't act rashly.

565
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,750
The decision should be made after it's discussed in the Immortal Palace.

566
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,870
Now, I can help you absorb the power of the spirit fire

567
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,970
to restore some of your vitality.

568
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,660
It can help with the emergency for the time being.

569
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,460
Then you can go find the King Herb.

570
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,660
When the mortal world is in trouble,

571
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,090
the Immortal Palace won't stand by and do nothing.

572
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,440
Thank you, Immortal Master.

573
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,520
Good.

574
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,940
Good.

575
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,420
Good!

576
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,510
-So beautiful. -Nice.

577
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,850

[To create wonders with a brush.]

580
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,670
The person I love is on the other side of the water.

581
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,010
I know the answer.

582
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,860
It should be reeds!

583
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,120
You are so brilliant, Miss.

584
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,000
In that case,

585
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,220
how about I draw a picture for you

586
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,270
as a souvenir?

587
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,830
We don't want pictures.

588
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,390
We're here for the King Herb.

589
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,140
Do you know it?

590
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,870
I don't know.

591
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,640
Since you passed my test,

592
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,600
I should draw a picture for you.

593
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,160
Look, it's a beautiful day

594
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,680

[To create wonders with a brush, Painting of Golden Autumn]

596

It's a pity if you give up the chance.

597
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,150
What you draw are plants, insects and birds.

598
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,960
There's no portrait.

599
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,470
Are you

600
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,320
capable of portrait painting?

601
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,170
Of course.

602

How about you be more witty?

619
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,510
It's better to be sharp.

Yes.

It's done.

625

Such a lifelike picture,

isn't it?

627
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,340
Wait, this is different

Of course.

630

Why would he draw the portrait of Marquis Wuyang?

631

This painting must be very important.

many vendors here.

643

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,910
Okay.

691
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,540
So you're from the Aquatic Demon clan.

692
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,510
How dare you fool me?

693
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,600
It's not fun at all.

694
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,580
Fine, I'll send you out.

695
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,690
We're finally back.

696
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,400
I'll teach you a lesson.

697
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,400
Damn fish demon.

698
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,040
You reacted quickly just now.

699
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,980
Were you really going to make a fire ball

700
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,170
and burn that painting?

701
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,480
How should the Aquatic Family set fire?

702
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,410
Please teach me, Mr. Lu.

703
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,920
Anyway,

704
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,800
you did well today.

705
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,150
Go out.

706
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,780
Turn left.

707
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,700
There's a big water tank.

708
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,020
See it as a reward for your action.

709
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,950
You really care about me, don't you?

710
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,050
Are you in need of water?

711
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,290
You... You're dry now.

712
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:07,870
Hurry up.

713
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,670
Hurry up.

714
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,070
Okay.

715
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,950
Where is that "painter" we met just now?

716
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,960
Where did he go?

717
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,830
Sorry.

718
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,300
I showed up hastily just now.

719
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,820
Let me formally introduce myself.

720
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,500
My name's "Wansui" [long live]!

721
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,100
I'm Father of all plants.

722
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,650
All plants in the mortal world

723
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,910
are my disciples.

724
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,450
However, time has not made me more arrogant,

725
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,680
but endowed me with modesty.

You were so proud in there

728
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,870
just now , weren't you?

729
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,140
I won't tell you any information about the King Herb.

730

You're quite stubborn.

731
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,430
Forget it.

732
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:02,930

Let's go.

I'm the ancestor.

How could I not know?

736
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:12,890
Will you

737
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,270
come back?

738
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,660
No.

739
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,720
Why?

740
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,850
Isn't it fun here?

741
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,040
Without us being with you,

you feel lonely now?

744
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,030
You feel the sense of emptiness?

745
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,810
I have the "Magic Plant Code".

746

The world there suits my heart the most.

747

Why would I be lonely?

748
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,930
Then just go have fun with

749
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,610
those boring plants.

750
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,870
Enjoy yourself.

00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,460
Let's go.

752
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,430
It seems that

you can't get out...

754

What did you say?

755
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,330
Demon King in White entered Marquis Wuyang's Mansion?

756
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:09,960
Yes.

757
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,270
That day, I saw

758
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,110
Demon King in White turned into a fish

759
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,580
and was taken into the Mansion by Liu Shao.

760
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,360
Demon King in White.

761
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,550
A demon

762
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,910
entered the place for hunting demons...

763

What are you doing?

764
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,750
Just with a drop of Liu Shao's blood,

765
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,850
I can then confirm

766
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,820
if she's the person I'm looking for.

You've lived for 10,000 years.

How have you lived so long?

What did you look like when you were young?

Were you in human form at that time?

Listen to it.

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,640
Stupid question.

Yes.

Sorry, I was wrong.

I was wrong.

778
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,730
Were you like the ginseng doll

on New Year paintings?

780
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,140
Will each of your hair

become a herb when it's torn out?

many more of your fellows will come out in autumn, right?

He's very smart,

and is a very...

836
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,250
A very good demon, right?

A very good demon!

how to get the King Herb

with the "Magic Plant Code"?

846
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,830
You're trying to trick me out of the secret, right?

847
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,940
You have to obey the rules we agreed on.

Actually, it doesn't matter if I tell you.

But

850
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,360
you have to promise me one thing.

851
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,750
What is it?

852
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,630
What?

853
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,050
You come to play with me every day.

Yes, he is my demon.
