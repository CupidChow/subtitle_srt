saying that he will attack the Aquatic Demons.

came for the Bone-Corroding Harp.

174
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,170
The people of Wu Yang Duke's Mansion

175
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,260
are worried about you and the Moon Sword.

176
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,420
Doesn't the Bone-Corroding Harp

177
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,940
belong to the Aquatic Demons?

178
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,460
Isn't this Immortal Palace overstepping too much?

179
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,780
To be exact,

180
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,620
it belonged to Immortal Ze Shui.

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,860
The death of Immortal Ze Shui

182
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,380
was also the pain of the Immortal Palace.

183
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,140
Her belongings

184
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,700
were naturally regarded as the property of the Immortal Palace.

185
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,690
I didn't expect to

186
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,700
get the entire Aquatic Demons in trouble because of me.

187
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,540
He Na.

188
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,420
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,900
It's not your fault.

190
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,420
Who would have thought

191
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,660
after ten thousand years,

192
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,090
the Bone-Corroding Harp can still cause such a big trouble.

193
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,450
Then return the Bone-Corroding Harp to them.

194
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,300
Then we can go back,

195
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,100
explain to the Immortal Palace

196
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,860
and ask them to withdraw their troops as soon as possible.

197
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,010
No.

198
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,580
What about your injury?

199
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,170
No matter what,

200
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,180
even if there is only a slight chance,

201
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,820
we shouldn't give up.

202
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,540
It's useless to send back the Bone-Corroding Harp.

203
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,940
The Immortal Palace won't accept

204
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,420
the Bone-Corroding Harp with a broken string.

205
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,580
They will also let the Demons pay for breaking the weapon.

206
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,130
But you didn't

207
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,700
break the weapon.

208
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,620
The Immortal Palace sent Xie Lingqi.

209
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,740
He doesn't like the Aquatic Demons.

210
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,660
He thinks we have evil intentions.

211
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,460
He won't let us off easily.

212
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
He Na.

213
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,700
I want to see Xie Lingqi.

214
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,620
I think

215
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,540
I might be able

216
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,100
to persuade Xie Lingqi.

217
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,380
But before that,

218
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,100
we have to find a way to repair the Bone-Corroding Harp.

219
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,740
Why is the string broken?

220
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,860
General Xie.

221
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,780
To be honest,

222
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,740
the harp

223
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,220
was retrieved by Liu Shao and me.

224
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,180
But this harp has been trapped in the demon world for ten thousand years.

225
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,220
It's very hostile.

226
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,980
That's why a string

227
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,980
broke in the battle.

228
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,740
Let's find the Demon King in White to seek help.

229
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,740
He has a way to repair the string.

230
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,580
I just sensed the water energy

231
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,980
of the Demon King in White on the Ice Rock Lake.

232
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,300
That's because

233
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,860
I borrowed some water energy from the Demon King in White

234
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,970
to find the trace of the Bone-Corroding Harp.

235
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,740
Could it be that the Demon King in White

236
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,940
wants to get the Bone-Corroding Harp

237
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,300
through you.

238
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,980
The Bone-Corroding Harp

239
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
is useless to them.

240
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,140
What do you mean?

241
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,140
General Xie.

242
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,930
You'll understand after you play it.

243
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
It won't make a sound.

244
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,060
What's going on?

245
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,500
Did you do something?

246
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,540
General Xie.

247
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,900
This Bone-Corroding Harp

248
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,220
is the weapon of Supreme Gods and Immortals.

249
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,820
We can't tamper with it.

250
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
But the fact is

251
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,580
only Liu Shao

252
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,860
can play the Bone-Corroding Harp.

253
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,020
Really?

254
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,980
Looks like we need to bring Liu Shao back to the Immortal Palace too.

255
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,060
Now we need

256
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,420
a Bone-Corroding Harp in good condition

257
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,630
and someone who can play it.

258
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,020
Please give us a few more days.

259
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,740
Don't make plans until the string is fixed.

260
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,980
Are you

261
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,980
pleading for

262
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,890
those Aquatic Demons?

263
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,860
General Xie.

264
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,180
If anything happens to the Demon King in White,

265
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,300
who else can repair this string?

266
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,420
Forget it.

267
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,860
I'll return the Bone-Corroding Harp

268
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,740
to you.

269
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,300
If you can't fix it,

270
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,770
you know

271
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,980
the consequence.

272
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,380
Let's go.

273
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,970
If we don't fix the Bone-Corroding Harp as soon as possible,

274
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,100
not only will the Immortal Palace be in trouble,

275
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,820
but Liu Shao also can't hold on any longer.

276
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,770
I told you

277
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,500
not to come to me

278
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,700
if there is nothing urgent.

279
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,530
The Bone-Corroding Harp was brought back to the demon world by Lu Li and Liu Shao.

280
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,620
Unfortunately, one string was broken.

281
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,460
It made the Immortal Palace join hands with the human race.

282
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,540
They want to harm the Aquatic Demons.

283
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,860
Do you think

284
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,780
this is important?

285
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,500
If the Demons are exterminated,

286
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,540
the Immortal Palace will be left alone.

287
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,140
Now, the one who came is just a general.

288
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,450
Aquatic Demons have a foundation for over ten thousand years.

289
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,100
As long as we're by the water,

290
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,500
or in water,

291
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,620
I have 100 ways to kill him.

292
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,340
It's just that I don't want to attract anyone else from the Immortal Palace here.

293
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,140
Tell me.

294
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,820
What can I do for you?

295
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,940
In order to repair the Bone-Corroding Harp,

296
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,250
I need Immortal Ze Shui's hair.

297
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,380
Who would have this in the three worlds?

298
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,860
After thinking about it,

299
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,900
it must be you.

300
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,900
Lu Sheng, the half demon, is experienced and knowledgeable.

301
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,580
Everyone in the three worlds knows it.

302
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,860
I've seen

303
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,340
this thing before.

304
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,620
Where?

305
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,940
Ten thousand years ago,

306
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,900
on Immortal Ze Shui's head.

307
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,660
Lu Li is quite annoying.

308
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,620
Like teacher,

309
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,460
like disciple.

310
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,860
Although we can't get the hair of Immortal Ze Shui,

311
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,500
when it comes to repairing the string,

312
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,260
there is something else that can replace it.

313
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,250
What is it?

314
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,300
The spiritual vein of the 1st Branch Demon King of the Aquatic Demons

315
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
is born flexible

316
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,210
and full of spiritual energy.

317
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,740
The Spiritual Vein of the Demon King

318
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,860
is your

319
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,380
or my spiritual vein.

320
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,300
It can be used

321
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,620
to repair the Bone-Corroding Harp.

322
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,900
Okay.

323
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,460
I see.

324
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,819
You may leave now.

325
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,460
It's lucky that the Immortal Palace

326
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,020
thinks my disciple is good.

327
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,740
Please enjoy.

328
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,500
Did you mean just now that

329
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,260
you want to wait for Liu Shao and the others to come back

330
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,700
and let Liu Shao

331
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,460
take the Bone-Corroding Harp

332
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,930
to the Immortal Palace alone?

333
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,180
If they can repair the Four Seasons Monument,

334
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,820
they can

335
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,620
stay in the Immortal Palace for cultivation?

336
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,890
Yes.

337
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,020
On the day the Four Seasons Monument was repaired,

338
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,250
the Duke's mansion

339
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,380
can choose disciples

340
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,620
to attend the ceremony.

341
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,860
Good.

342
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,780
I have another disciple

343
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,900
named Lu Li.

344
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,260
This person

345
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,500
is as talented

346
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,140
as Liu Shao.

347
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,660
I also value him very much.

348
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,660
If you allow Lu Li

349
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,940
to cultivate in the Immortal Palace

350
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,380
with Liu Shao...

351
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,700
That won't be necessary.

352
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,500
The Immortal Master said

353
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,020
to choose only Liu Shao.

354
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,860
From now on,

355
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,580
they won't be the same.

356
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,660
Please have some tea.

357
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,140
Are you crazy?

358
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,220
Are you really going to extract your own spiritual vein?

359
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,180
Fu,

360
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,740
I can tell

361
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,660
what is more important.

362
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,930
And I can also tell.

363
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,700
You're the Demon King.

364
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,900
You're my brother.

365
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,180
You are more important

366
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,220
than me.

367
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,700
Fu!

368
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Fu!

369
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,380
Mr. Tai.

370
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,770
Mr. Tai.

371
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,500
Fu.

372
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,900
Fu.

373
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,700
The hair of Ze Shui ten thousand years ago

374
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,660
was found by you.

375
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,020
It's not easy.

376
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,220
I hope it can really heal Liu Shao

377
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,260
as rumored

378
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,810
and relieve the crisis of our race today.

379
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,540
This tune is called Brahma.

380
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,300
It's a musical score

381
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,580
recorded after listening to the Brahma trees blossom.

382
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,980
The love of Brahma

383
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,900
is the most true and the purest,

384
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,660
and never pretends.

385
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,220
It can be used to cure

386
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,260
and warm

387
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,180
the pain engraved into the bones.

388
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
General Fu,

389
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,330
you shouldn't drink in your current condition.

390
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,810
Leave me alone, Mr. Tai.

391
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,060
You may leave now.

392
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,620
-Liu Shao. -Liu Shao.

393
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,780
Liu Shao.

394
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,180
Liu Shao.

395
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,810
The sound of the harp is working.

396
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,490
Her devouring wound

397
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,580
should be fine now.

398
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,260
It's just that her spiritual power is exhausted.

399
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,820
Really?

400
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,210
That's great.

401
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,300
Great.

402
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,660
After Liu Shao is recovered,

403
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,060
she will return to Wu Yang Duke's Mansion.

404
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,100
Ao Hen's been looking for her.

405
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,620
She must be anxious now.

406
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,580
You're awake.

407
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,060
How are you?

408
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,900
Do you feel better?

409
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,100
When I think that your Soul-Devouring Spell hasn't been lifted,

410
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,250
my heart aches.

411
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,420
It won't happen for a while.

412
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,570
Don't worry.

413
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,420
Why didn't you tell me

414
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,540
your master cast the Soul-Devouring Spell on you?

415
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,060
If I told you,

416
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,780
wouldn't it make you worry along with me?

417
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,170
I don't want you to feel sorry for me.

418
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,660
Now that I know, I don't feel sorry?

419
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,700
It's all my fault.

420
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,860
Close your eyes.

421
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,260
Do you hear me?

422
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,660
Yes.

423
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,410
I was born with only half a heart.

424
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,140
Now,

425
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,740
I found the other half.

426
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,860
It's you.

427
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,500
A demon general

428
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
was reduced to borrowing my formation for healing.

429
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,530
I didn't expect

430
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,500
you are so cruel to yourself.

431
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,820
As long as my people

432
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,380
can see the sun again,

433
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,420
and not be trapped in the water,

434
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,020
not to mention the spiritual vein,

435
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,020
I can even give my life.

436
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,020
I still have a lot of fun to watch.

437
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,620
There's no time to waste.

438
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,220
So,

439
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,340
I can only borrow your formation to heal

440
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,930
and find more demon energy.

441
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,580
Fun to watch?

442
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,860
I've asked someone to inform Ao Hen.

443
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,700
Liu Shao and Lu Li

444
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,860
will leave the demon world in two days.

445
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,660
The Moon Sword is against me.

446
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,100
You have to keep it now.

447
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,810
Go back and think of a way

448
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
to see what can drive it,

449
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,860
but not be devoured by it.

450
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,060
If I can drive the Moon Sword,

451
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,370
I'll kill Ao Hen first.

452
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,900
In that case,

453
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,580
we won't have any worries.

454
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,860
Really?

455
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,140
Goodness.

456
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,220
You really showed up.

457
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,710
I...

458
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,510
Last time you beat me up,

459
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,340
I refused to accept it as final.

460
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,460
I've long wanted to win back.

461
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,540
What about

462
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,500
we switch places today?

463
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,740
It's not dark yet.

464
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,660
Why are you dreaming here?

465
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,260
Really?

466
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,540
At the same time,

467
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,340
I also reminded my brother.

468
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,180
Ao Hen has been watching Liu Shao for a long time.

469
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,780
As long as Liu Shao leaves the demon world,

470
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,620
she's likely to be ambushed by Ao Hen.

471
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,300
Ao Hen?

472
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,980
This is not your lair.

473
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,460
The Moon Washing Pond is right next to it.

474
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,420
How many moves from the Demon King in White can you catch?

475
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,540
Besides,

476
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,860
we're here.

477
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,740
Could it be that

478
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,340
you set a trap

479
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,660
for me?

480
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,140
This time,

481
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,330
we're going to catch the rat in the hole.

482
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,140
You don't just want your brother

483
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,730
to have a fight with Ao Hen?

484
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,580
No way.

485
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,980
My dear brother has offered to help.

486
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,140
We must get some benefits.

487
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,500
So I sent someone to inform Xie Lingqi.

488
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,460
Ao Hen's lair

489
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,690
is empty.

490
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,540
She took a lot of vitality

491
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,300
and demon energy for Ao Yin.

492
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,890
How could the Immortal Palace miss this opportunity?

493
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,940
Getting rid of her now will save future troubles.

494
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,340
General Xie,

495
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,700
we didn't find Ao Yin.

496
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,020
So that little beast

497
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
isn't here?

498
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,180
Sure enough, here it is.

499
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,820
Yin.

500
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,370
You're cruel.

501
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,700
I want to be more cruel.

502
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,500
Will you help me?

503
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,650
Yin.

504
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,820
Your Majesty.

505
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,900
Your Majesty.

506
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,780
Tell me.

507
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,140
What happened?

508
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,420
Yes.

509
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,700
It's the Immortal Palace.

510
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,340
Even Young Master...

511
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,260
He Na.

512
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,180
Thank you.

513
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,180
Thank you for your help.

514
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,260
Hey.

515
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,140
What do you mean?

516
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,420
What about me? Am I not important?

517
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:51,580
Anyway,

518
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,300
thank you.

519
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,260
You're welcome.

520
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,610
Lu Li.

521
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,820
When Liu Shao returns to the Duke's Mansion,

522
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,060
take good care of her.

523
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,700
Don't worry.

524
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,500
You won't have an opportunity.

525
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,900
I hope so.

526
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,220
Liu Shao.

527
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,380
I'm leaving.

528
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,020
We're really lucky

529
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,260
to meet such a friend.

530
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,130
Right?

531
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,260
Yes, but...

532
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,180
Xue.

533
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,460
Liu Shao.

534
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,300
Liu Shao.

535
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,940
Liu Shao is back.

536
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,420
What about my brother?

537
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
He's waiting for you to give him drumsticks.

538
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,540
Brother.

539
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,540
Brother.

540
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,060
Welcome back.

541
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,980
Looks like Fattie really loves you.

542
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,580
He even gave you his favorite drumsticks.

543
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,860
Look at them.

544
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,820
Give me a hug.

545
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,020
You...

546
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,780
Your hand holding the drumstick...

547
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,100
The Lord heard that you are back.

548
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,580
He's summoning everyone.

549
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,190
[Yu Yu Hall]

550
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,260
Today,

551
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,100
I gather you

552
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,780
to announce a happy event

553
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,780
that brought glory

554
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,100
to Wu Yang Duke's Mansion.

555
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,940
Liu Shao.

556
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,580
Come up.

557
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,720
The Lord is calling you.

558
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,980
I hereby announce

559
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,820
Liu Shao of Lingxi Yard is

560
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,380
smart and upright.

561
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,260
After selection,

562
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,860
now, the Immortal Palace decided

563
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,980
to give her the opportunity

564
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,580
to cultivate in the Immortal Palace.

565
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,300
Liu Shao?

566
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,580
She's so lucky.

567
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,900
Liu Shao is going to the Immortal Palace.

568
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,450
My Lord, what's going on?

569
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,380
Liu Shao.

570
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,300
If I don't want to go, can someone else go?

571
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,020
It's such a good opportunity, why doesn't she want to go?

572
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,180
Yes.

573
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,739
This is decided by the Immortal Palace.

574
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,699
Even I

575
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,139
have no right to change.

576
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,820
If you enter the Immortal Palace,

577
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,460
not only can you get an opportunity to practice magic,

578
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,250
but also get rid of the limits of human body

579
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,860
and be immortal.

580
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,179
This is an opportunity that all disciples dream of.

581
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,820
You should cherish it.

582
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,060
But Lu Li...

583
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,340
Lu Li?

584
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,340
I have another plan for him.

585
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,620
Only you

586
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,420
can go to the Immortal Palace.

587
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,739
However,

588
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,340
I can send Lu Li

589
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,659
to escort you to the Immortal Palace.

590
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
In this way,

591
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
you two can take care of each other on the way.

592
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,460
Lu Li.

593
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,660
Yes.

594
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,260
The Moon Sword will be given to you from now on.

595
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,140
The future of Wu Yang Duke's Mansion

596
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,860
is left to you.

597
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,500
Yes, My Lord.

598
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:09,940
What does this mean?

599
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,820
The Lord meant...

600
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,700
Lu Li is the next Wu Yang Duke?

601
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,580
Really?

602
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,380
Lu Li is amazing.

603
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,570
You know what?

604
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
When I was young, I wanted to go to the Immortal Palace

605
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,940
to find the immortal who accompanied me for three days.

606
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
But now,

607
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,140
I'd rather stay in the mortal world.

608
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,940
And that Bone-Corroding Harp

609
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,860
is useless to me now.

610
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,980
Just ask them

611
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,220
to send it to the Immortal Palace.

612
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:30,940
What do you think?

613
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,020
No way.

614
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,940
They want the person who can play the Bone-Corroding Harp

615
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,300
and repair the Four Seasons Tombstone.

616
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,220
How about this?

617
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,540
I'll send you there first.

618
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,930
Then I'll follow you

619
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,660
and play it by ear.

620
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,500
See if I can stay.

621
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,620
Stay?

622
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Have you forgotten my background?

623
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,420
Liar.

624
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,140
Anyway,

625
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,490
I have to send you there first.

626
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,780
When you play the tune,

627
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,420
the Lord and the others will go to the auditorium.

628
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
I will go with them.

629
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,900
By then,

630
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,890
I'll stick around shamelessly.

631
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,740
If I can't,

632
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,340
I'll stay at the foot of the Immortal Palace.

633
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Then you can see me everyday

634
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,940
when you get down.

635
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,860
You're right.

636
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,340
I'll go see you every day.

637
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,620
If they don't let me

638
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,820
and kick me out,

639
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,380
that's exactly what I want.

640
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,340
My Liu Shao

641
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,820
is getting smarter.

642
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,340
My Lu Li is getting smarter

643
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,020
and cuter too.

644
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,460
All right.

645
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,020
It's getting late.

646
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,820
Go back and rest early.

647
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,740
I have something to ask the Lord.

648
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,060
I'll go back then.

649
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,570
Come out.

650
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,580
Lu Li.

651
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,940
You really only have Liu Shao

652
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,460
in your heart?

653
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,860
Don't you care nothing about our old love?

654
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,980
The fire in Pearl Pavilion

655
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,780
has burned all our love back then.

656
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,500
I didn't kill you

657
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,940
because of the vicious plan on the day you drew the sword.

658
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,820
That's the most mercy I can give you.

659
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,740
But that's because I love you.

660
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,740
It's your business who you love.

661
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,940
It has nothing to do with me.

662
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,820
It's my business who I love.

663
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,890
It's none of your business.

664
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
Please stay away from me.

665
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,780
It's disgusting.

666
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,570
No, I can't let go.

667
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,700
I can't.

668
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,460
I'll teach you how to let go.

669
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,690
Master.

670
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,820
Kneel!

671
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,300
Traitor!

672
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,940
I told you

673
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,780
not to hurt Liu Shao.

674
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,860
Have you ever kept my words in your heart?

675
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,380
It's useless.

676
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,140
I have two disciples.

677
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,020
None

678
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,500
can be kept.

679
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,890
Master.

680
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,900
Li.

681
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,420
Up to this day,

682
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,420
haven't you seen it clearly?

683
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,900
For her,

684
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,420
you gave up the opportunity to return as Supreme God.

685
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,980
But she

686
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,900
can enter the Immortal Palace.

687
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,660
After a hundred years,

688
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,180
she'll still be beautiful.

689
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,100
But you

690
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,820
will be old and weak,

691
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,540
just like a rotten wood.

692
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,090
Are you satisfied?

693
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,940
If I have tried,

694
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
and the result is the same.

695
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,500
I'm content.

696
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,860
Content?

697
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,180
Li,

698
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,140
I advised you not to fall in love with her.

699
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,980
Because I was worried that you would die because of her.

700
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,300
But now,

701
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,540
you have the Moon Sword.

702
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,700
As long as you can make up your mind

703
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,460
and cleave the Four Seasons Monument,

704
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,500
by then,

705
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,700
you can stay with

706
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,260
Liu Shao.

707
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,780
Master, you mean

708
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,780
as long as I cleave the Four Seasons Monument,

709
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,980
I can be with Liu Shao forever?

710
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,420
As long as you cleave the Four Seasons Monument,

711
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,060
you will be a complete God of Moonlight.

712
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,940
By then,

713
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,740
let alone Liu Shao,

714
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,700
no one in the three worlds

715
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,740
can separate you.

716
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,620
I’ll take Bai Feng with me.

717
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,740
You should

718
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,300
think about it.

719
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,900
Since you're ruthless,

720
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,900
why should you be sad?

721
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

722
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,940
You instigated Lu Li to use the Moon Sword

723
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,060
to break the Four Seasons Monument.

724
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,380
But he's just a mortal.

725
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,100
Once he forces his divine power to use the Moon Sword,

726
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,460
he will be devoured and turn into ashes.

727
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,180
Isn't this ruthless?

728
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,820
I did everything to revive the Supreme God.

729
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,460
It takes a price

730
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,700
to do great things.

731
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,420
I am ruthless,

732
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,380
but I'm not sad.

733
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,060
This Fritillary Bulb Paste

734
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,580
was made by Lu Li, right?

735
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,140
It's gone bad.

736
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,450
Why did you put it on the table

737
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,180
and stare at it in a daze every day?

738
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,540
Throw it away for me.

739
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,340
Why?

740
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,340
Sadness doesn't hinder your ruthlessness.

741
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,740
You still have some time

742
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,780
to say goodbye to your disciples.

743
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,820
Someone has to pay the price

744
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,380
for the Immortals to revive.

745
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,180
Li,

746
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,900
don't blame me.
