00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,100
Why did you summon the Bone-Corroding Harp?

5
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,060
The Bone-Corroding Harp?

6
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,259
I didn't summon it.

7
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,340
Could it be

8
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,580
it thinks

9
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,980
I've become the Demon Queen?

10
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,660
You won't be the Demon Queen.

11
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,260
Luo Ning,

12
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,020
the merging wine you just drank

13
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,579
was made from the Phoenix Tears.

14
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,860
It will make you forget

15
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,780
all the people

16
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,140
and things you love.

17
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,900
What did you say?

18
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,020
Forget all the people and things I love?

19
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,780
Then I'll forget...

20
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,540
No.

21
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,250
No.

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,180
Don't struggle to hold on.

23
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,340
You'll soon forget He Na.

24
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,900
You

25
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,340
have always been willful.

26
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,820
No.

27
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,220
You will never marry

28
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,130
a stranger, right?

29
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,140
No.

30
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,060
No.

31
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,740
He Na should be here soon.

32
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,020
What's wrong with Mr. Tai?

33
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,860
I saw through

34
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,860
his scheme easily.

35
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,980
So I put

36
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,940
the tampered clothes

37
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,340
in a beautiful place.

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,340
And I just wait for my brother

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,420
to bring the people from the Immortal Palace

40
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,060
to step into the trap.

41
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,579
No.

Fu.

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,020
It's not He Na.

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,140
Stop doing bad things.

45
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,380
Luo Ning.

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,140
Forget He Na.

47
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,250
Let's start over.

No.

51
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,260
Fairy Luo Ning,

52
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,140
although it's one day late,

53
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,820
I still want to wish you a happy birthday.

54
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,420
How about I be your brother?

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,100
I am

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,579
about 1,000 years old this year.

57

♫In the sea of clouds, I looked at the reflection of the moon in the water♫

60
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,180
I'm almost 1,000 years old.

61

♫I kept waiting and arched my palms into a circle♫

That means you haven't.

Call me sister.

65
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,460

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
but in the northeast.

175
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,060
She's at least 100 miles away.

176
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,700
That is…

177
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,700
The Ice Rock Lake.

178
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,700
Ice Rock Lake?

179
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:45,980
Yes.

180
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,580
Liu Shao.

181
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,500
Isn't that the place where we found the Bone-Corroding Harp?

182
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,060
It's extremely unfavorable to the Melody race.

183
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,220
Why is Fu there?

184
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:33,860
Luo Ning.

185
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,620
You're awake.

186
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,300
Who are you?

187
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,190
[Happy]

188
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,940
Tell me.

189
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,060
What's your name?

190
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,500
My name is Fu.

191
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,500
You look nice.

192
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,900
But my brother is still more handsome.

193
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,740
You look

194
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,420
nice.

195
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,740
But my brother

196
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,380
is still more handsome.

197
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,780
You are just

198
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,290
slimmer.

199
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,500
Maybe too slim.

200
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,180
I'll gain weight.

201
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,340
You don't look like a good person.

202
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,580
But

203
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,700
you're quite interesting.

204
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,700
As long as I am interesting to you.

205
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,740
By the way,

206
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,540
why am I here?

207
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,860
I clearly remember that

208
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,180
I was

209
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,380
in the wedding with He Na.

210
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,940
When we were bowing,

211
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,380
he left for something suddenly.

212
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,060
And then...

213
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,090
And then what happened?

214
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,180
Something happened to my brother

215
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,420
so he asked me to bring you here.

216
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,620
Your brother?

217
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,740
So you're He Na's brother.

218
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,020
Yes.

219
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,980
That's strange.

220
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,100
Is there anything more important

221
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,210
than our wedding?

222
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,820
Did you

223
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,540
marry He Na

224
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,820
to lift the curse?

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,020
Yes.

226
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,100
That eternal curse

227
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,130
has hurt many Aquatic Demons.

228
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,980
It also hurt that...

229
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,900
that...

230
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,370
It hurt that...

231
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,180
I can't remember.

232
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,860
It hurt me.

233
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,130
It made me do a lot of bad things

234
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,820
that made you sad.

235
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,130
You don't want me to do bad things.

236
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,700
What are you talking about?

237
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,660
I don't know you at all.

238
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,140
What does it have to do

239
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,660
with me?

240
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,220
You really don't know me?

241
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,420
I've been in your room for so long.

242
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,260
Why didn't you drive me away?

243
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,420
Here is not the Immortal Palace,

244
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,020
nor my house.

245
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,380
Don't they look alike?

246
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,580
They do.

247
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,100
But

248
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,540
I feel something's wrong.

249
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,420
It seems

250
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,420
something is missing.

251
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,820
What is missing? Let me help you.

252
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,580
I know.

253
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,380
This is it.

254
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,620
This doll

255
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,130
is made of my clothes.

256
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,180
It means everything

257
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,380
-is from me. -Don't

258
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,500
give me this ugly doll.

259
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,420
Otherwise,

260
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,820
it will destroy

261
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,500
the feng shui of the Waterside Pavilion.

262
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,380
Do you remember this ugly doll?

263
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,210
Of course I do.

264
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Before I got married,

265
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,010
♫I want to get close but I can't see clearly♫

266

267

This doll is so ugly.

268

♫Who arranged this rain?♫

269
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,220

when I got married?

271
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,660
It's strange.

272
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,180
If I don't take it with me,

273
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,930
♫I want to avoid but I meet you again♫

How dare you be rude to me!

280
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,020
My brother and He Na

281
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
won't let you off.

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,460

Seems that

296
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,060
it's burnt from the inside.

No.

By the way,

310
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,580
what's your name?

311
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,140
My name is Fu.

312
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,420
Fu?

313
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,980
I think

314
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,220
I did these things for you before.

315
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,980
You did.

316
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Really?

317
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,580
But why

318
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,060
I can't remember?

319
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,060
Are we really close?

320
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,460
Not only are we close,

321
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,420
we are a real couple.

322
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,860
So you can't marry my brother.

323
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,540
I will beg my brother,

324
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,860
your brother,

325
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,060
and the people in the Immortal Palace

326
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,900
to agree to our marriage.

327
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,900
As long as I can be with you,

328
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm willing to pay any price.

329
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,700
In the future,

330
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,740
we will have a lovely kid.

331
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,500
They have no reason to reject us.

332
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,380
But I really don't remember

333
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,260
anything you said.

334
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,540
F...

335
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,340

Fu.

337
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,180
No matter how much you said,

338
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,420
I have to ask my brother

339
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,780
what's going on first.

340
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,420

♫The stars call the morning sky♫

342

00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,260

344

346
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,890

347
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,300
that made you forget me.

you won't hate me anymore.

♫When will we separate?♫

leaving me here

373
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,050
and not letting me out?

374
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,300

♫Please don't tell us our ending in advance♫

I'll take you out.

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,860
I'll take you to

wherever you want.

379
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,810
But if

380
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,420
I can't come back,

381
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,380
your brother will take you out.

382
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,660
My brother?

383
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,140
Are you going to find my brother?

384
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,940
But you just said

385
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,740
you did many wrong things.

386
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,060
Will he kill you?

387
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,500
Maybe.

388
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,380
But since you don't remember me,

389
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,700
you won't be sad, right?

390
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,300

As you wish,

433
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,620
someone fell into the trap

434
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,820
in the center of the Great Wilderness.

435
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,620
That's right.

436
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,020
If they want to track me,

437
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,860
they need to sacrifice something.

438
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,900
Who fell into it?

439
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,900
Only the Demon King in White.

440
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,740
My brother?

441
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,210
Shouldn't him bring Luo Ge

442
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,020
and Wanwu

443
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,690
together?

444
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,620
On the contrary,

445
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,580
he went there alone

446
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,140
to distract them.

447
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,700
Probably because he's afraid that people from the Immortal Palace

448
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,290
will hurt you.

449
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,140
That place is extremely dangerous.

450
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,540
With my brother's cultivation,

451
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,900
will he be okay in there?

452
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,620
Luo Ge and the people from the Immortal Palace

453
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,180
will probably be induced to chase Luo Ning.

454
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,100
But we don't know

455
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,980
if they can save your brother.

456
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,690
Since Luo Ge is here,

457
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,940
I can't

458
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,980
involve in this matter.

459
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:41,940
What is that?

460
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,420
The Trap of Spiritual Power.

461
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,340
Demon King was trapped just now.

462
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,170
I wanted to save him.

463
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,940
But when I got close to that place,

464
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,540
my spiritual power became so uncontrollable

465
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,460
that I can hardly use magic.

466
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
I'm afraid this trap

467
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,500
was set especially for us by Fu.

468
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,900
Ge.

469
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,540
Didn’t you say Ning is not here?

470
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,930
It's none of our business that

471
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,580
He Na was tricked into the trap by his brother.

472
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,500
We don't have to take the risk for him.

473
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,340
Immortal Master,

474
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,940
He Na is my friend.

475
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,260
Now that he's in trouble,

476
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,860
I can’t stand by.

477
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,420
Shang Yurong,

478
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,300
the marriage is not completed.

479
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,780
There are a lot of unsettled issues

480
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,860
in the Immortal Palace and the Demon Palace.

481
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,300
Why don't you go out first?

482
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,060
Immortal Master can accompany me.

483
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,900
OK.

484
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,620
Be careful.

485
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,260
Okay.

486
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,180
Luo Ge.

487
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,340
Luo Ge.

488
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,340
I'm sorry.

489
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,060
He Na.

490
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Didn't I remind you

491
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,260
not to protect Fu again?

492
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,060
But you hid his whereabouts on purpose.

493
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,700
These days,

494
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,140
I was busy with the wedding

495
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,340
and neglected him.

496
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,860
That's why he got the chance.

497
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,780
Luo Ge.

498
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,260
I'll try my best to find Luo Ning.

499
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,820
That's not what I want.

500
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,820
You must find Luo Ning.

501
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,340
The terrestrial aura here is weird.

502
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,660
It can confuse spiritual power.

503
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,340
This is the center of the Great Wilderness.

504
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:51,980
I didn't expect

505
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,780
Fu subdued the remnants of the eagle demons

506
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,290
and used this place to trap us.

507
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:56,940
Luo Ge.

508
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,060
I'll use the water energy

509
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,300
to block the terrestrial aura.

510
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,100
Break the encirclement of demons

511
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,290
and leave.

512
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,460
When Liu Shao and I

513
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,500
were hunted down by Ao Hen,

514
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,220
you protected us again and again.

515
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,180
Fine.

516
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,620
With the help of Immortal Luo Ge,

517
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,620
I don't believe

518
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,180
we can't break this trap.

519
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,180
What should we do?

520
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,260
Surround them.

521
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,020
The terrestrial aura here

522
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,900
is favorable to us.

523
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,220
The longer it takes,

524
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,260
the weaker they are.

525
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,290
They will come out sooner or later.

526
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,820
Stop.

527
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,500
Greetings,

528
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,530
Immortal Master.

529
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:09,940
You

530
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,860
have always been

531
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,140
unruly.

532
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,700
But after

533
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,780
you got your brother and Luo Ge into trouble,

534
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,300
you've become polite.

535
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,130
What are you up to?

536
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,210
You

537
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,980
are Luo Ning's elder.

538
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,700
It's reasonable for me

539
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,300
to be polite.

540
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,220
Luo Ning.

541
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,580
Don't mention Luo Ning to me.

542
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,700
Why did you get her involved

543
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,940
and ruin her marriage?

544
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,860
It's all my fault.

545
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,580
After I rescue my brother,

546
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,180
I will go to the Immortal Palace personally

547
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,100
to apologize.

548
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,820
Apologize?

549
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,780
You made their marriage into such a big joke.

550
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,690
Do you think you will be forgiven

551
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,980
by saying you're sorry?

552
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,860
Even if He Na, the Demon King,

553
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,460
will kneel down and apologize,

554
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,260
it depends on whether Immortal Luo Ge will accept it or not.

555
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,450
He can't even discipline his own brother.

556
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,130
I think

557
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,900
He Na can't be the Demon King anymore.

558
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,900
To make up my mistake,

559
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,860
I can even

560
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,660
give out my life.

561
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,420
But please don't insult my brother.

562
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,900
You stole your brother's marriage.

563
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,500
How dare you're still pretending?

564
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,100
Immortal Master,

565
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,460
you've gone too far.

566
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,900
I didn't use all my strength.

567
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,300
How could he be hurt?

568
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,140
Kid.

569
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,860
You are too young

570
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,020
to fight me.

571
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,810
Luo Ning.

572
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,620
Luo Ning.

573
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,260
Where does the tweedle come from?

574
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,700
Bone-Corroding Harp.

575
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,340
Luo Ning must be nearby.

576
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
Fu set a Protection Spell here.

577
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,530
Where is the entrance?

578
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,260
Crown Wheel,

579
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,980
take me to the entrance.

580
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,620
You know music well.

581
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,540
I want to give this harp to you

582
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,900
as your birthday gift.

583
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,380
Does it have a name?

584
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,290
It's made of the Love Wood

585
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,460
which is also known as the Bone-Corroding Wood.

586
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,580
That's why it's called the Bone-Corroding Harp.

587
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,260
Love

588
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,380
can corrode everything.

589
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,700
We can't know

590
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,410
it's fortunate or unfortunate

591
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,090
to meet the one you love.

592
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,540
It's always a fortune

593
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,620
to meet.

594
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,140
But what if the ending is unfortunate?

595
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,100
As long as it's my choice,

596
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
no matter the result

597
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
is good or bad,

598
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,170
I will not regret it.

599
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,620
The Protection Spell disappeared.

600
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,100
God of the Sun.

601
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,660
Ze Shui.

602
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,540
I...

603
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,620
Liu Shao.

604
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,020
I'm not Ze Shui.

605
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,980
I'm Luo Ning.

606
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,220
And I'm not the God of the Sun.

607
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,460
It must be the Crown Wheel and the Bone-Corroding Harp

608
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,460
that recalled the memories of Ze Shui and the God of the Sun.

609
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,660
Here is...

610
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,460
Look.

611
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,050
Is it the same as my old house?

612
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,940
It's that...

613
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,140
that...

614
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,260
that...

615
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,260
Fu?

616
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,180
Yes.

617
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,060
He must have decorated this place.

618
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,020
It looks like he prepared it for me.

619
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,500
But I don't know why,

620
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,740
after he left,

621
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,260
I can't remember his face.

622
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,060
When he was by my side,

623
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,820
I couldn't remember his name.

624
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,420
I...

625
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,700
You don't remember him?

626
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,460
Use your water energy to resist the evil spirit.

627
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,820
I will use the Moon Sword

628
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,580
to break the encirclement of demons.

629
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,460
Okay.

630
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,980
You mean

631
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,220
that boy

632
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,380
and my brother

633
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,740
are all here.

634
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,460
Your brother and He Na

635
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,700
were induced here by Fu.

636
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,540
I'm afraid he set an ambush.

637
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,020
Fu set an ambush?

638
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,980
Is he going to do something bad again?

639
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,460
Again?

640
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,780
Why should I say "again"?

641
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,180
How many things had happened

642
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,540
between us?

643
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,020
Why can't I remember anything?

644
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,140
Immortal Master.

645
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:37,860
Fu.

646
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,820
Immortal Master.

647
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,260
Immortal Master.

648
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,500
Fu.

649
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,820
Brother.

650
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,500
Immortal Master.

651
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,220
Ge.

652
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,780
Ge.

653
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,380
Don’t let him go.

654
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,540
I didn't mean to hurt him.

655
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,820
He must have done this

656
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,580
because he's been corroded by evil things.

657
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,260
He may harm the three worlds

658
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,820
and the people at any time.

659
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,380
Nonsense!

660
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,820
Nonsense!

661
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,930
How could he resist my evil spirit?

662
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,940
Ge.

663
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,460
Look.

664
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,900
The evil spirit.

665
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,900
Fu.

666
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,140
Go back with me first.

667
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,340
I don't want to do this.

668
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,900
But you force me.

669
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,340
Fu!

670
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,620
Luo Ning.

671
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,739
Luo Ning.

672
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,500
Luo Ning.

673
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,219
Luo Ning.

674
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:57,980
You will be fine.

675
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,060
I'll save you right away.

676
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,500
Luo Ning.

677
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,170
Luo Ning.

678
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,140
Luo Ning!

679
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,620
Luo Ning.

680
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,980
Luo Ning.

681
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,500
Brother, don't…

682
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,620
don't kill him

683
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,260
and do useless healing.

684
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,580
[Fu]

685
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,140
Fu.

686
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,500
With this,

687
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,260
I won't forget.

688
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,300
No.

689
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,940
Luo Ning.

690
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,980
You should have forgotten me.

691
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,130
If you had forgotten me earlier,

692
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,890
this wouldn't have happened.

693
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm sorry.

694
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,860
Luo Ning.

695
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,860
Luo Ning.

696
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,210
Luo Ning.

697
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,220
Fu.

698
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,060
I really

699
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,340
can't remember you.

700
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,340
But I really want to remember

701
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,500
what had happened

702
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,980
between us.

703
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,500
Many...

704
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,300
many things had happened between us.

705
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,420
Many things.

706
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,460
You're not good at crafting.

707
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,940
But

708
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,410
you deal with things quite interestingly.

709
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,340
Leave through here.

710
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,940
What if I don't come back?

711
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,860
If you don't come back,

712
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,100
I don't think I can do anything.

713
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,060
What are you talking about?

714
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,820
I mean you shouldn't fight again.

715

♫On rainy days, wind blows smoke♫

716

Even you dislike me

717
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,180
because I am an aquatic monster

♫Into circles♫

719
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,100
that will die without water, right?

720
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,580
You're not a monster.

♫On both sides, I'm chanting♫

Although

724

you are not a good person,

725

♫The shadows of the moon are incomplete, and people are in love♫

726

♫A cocoon of shadows♫

728

♫Your promise, my fate♫

730
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,700
has trapped our clan for ten thousand years.

731

No matter what it takes,

732
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,740
I will lift it.

733
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,420
No crooked ways.

♫In spring, seasons changed♫

No crooked ways.

739
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,700
Okay?

740

♫Is like the things we went through♫

743

♫Beside the lake, on the boat♫

745

♫Can compare with the rest of my life♫

750

Is that

751
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,890
♫I look at my love and send it to the clouds outside the garden♫

Yes.

754

I just want you to be fine.

♫You put the winter snow in your ears and can’t hear it♫

♫When the flowers stop falling, you and I will miss each other♫
