[Episode 11]

4
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,060
How dare you come back?

5
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,780
You lost the Moon Sword.

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,300
And now you are begging me to save Liu Shao.

7
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,620
Tell me, why should I save her?

8
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,580
I want to know the truth from Master.

9
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,330
Back then, you asked me to escort Liu Shao

10
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,340
to Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

11
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,220
The real purpose

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,780
is that she is the only one

13
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,060
that can pull out the Moon Sword, right?

14
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,420
Yes.

15
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,140
You don't allow me to fall in love with her

16
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,579
because you know

17
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:23,300
she would die after pulling out the Moon Sword.

18
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,860
What else do you know?

19
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,740
Rumour has it that

20
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,820
the Moon Sword is the weapon of God of the Moonlight.

21
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,980
During the Battle of Two Gods,

22
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,940
God of the Sun sealed the Moon Sword in the mortal world.

23
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,980
But Liu Shao can break the seal and pull out the sword.

24
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,860
And she conflicts with the power of the Moon Sword.

25
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,380
Then the mysterious light in her body...

26
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,100
That's right.

27
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,780
It's the divine spirit of God of the Sun.

28
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,740
So,

29
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,140
I'm protecting the inheritor of God of the Sun?

30
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,460
But do you know who you are?

31
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,060
Why did you see the Battle of Two Gods in the illusion

32
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,020
as if it is your own experience?

33
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,020
Lu Li.

34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Because the half of the heart in your body

35
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,660
belongs to God of the Moonlight.

36
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,860
And God of the Moonlight and God of the Sun

37
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,530
are destined enemies.

38
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,420
You only have half a heart

39
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,380
because God of the Sun

40
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,740
split God of the Moonlight's heart into half.

41
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,660
Half of it is suppressed under the Four Seasons Monument.

42
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,940
Half of it turned into you.

43
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,960
You and Liu Shao inherited the hatred of the two gods.

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,600
That's why your spiritual power will oppose each other

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,540
and hurt each other.

46
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,860
If you lack the other half of heart,

47
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,700
you can only be the shadow of God of the Moonlight in mortal world.

48
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
You will disappear one day.

49
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,899
I want you to live

50
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,220
and God of the Moonlight to come back.

51
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,210
That's why I asked you to get the Moon Sword.

52
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,530
Only by using the Moon Sword

53
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,210
to break the Four Seasons Monument,

54
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
can you get back

55
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,980
the other half of your heart under the monument

56
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,620
and become God of the Moonlight completely.

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,040
Master,

58
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,720
did you already know that

59
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,260
if I become God of the Moonlight,

60
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,580
Liu Shao will die.

61
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,300
So what?

62
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,540
As long as you can become God of the Moonlight,

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,980
nothing else matters.

64
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,100
I'll give you one last chance.

65
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,980
Get back the Moon Sword from Liu Shao.

66
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
Otherwise,

67
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,540
there is nothing you can do but die.

68
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,620
Lu Li!

69
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,700
Liu Shao.

70
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,900
It's me.

71
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,620
Liu Shao.

72
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,780
You mustn't use your vitality anymore.

73
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Here.

74
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,740
You just woke up.

75
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,660
Your spiritual power is injured

76
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,460
and you are still quite weak.

77
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,940
You have to eat something no matter what.

78
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,740
Thank you, He Na.

79
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,300
Sorry to bother you again

80
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,900
this time.

81
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,140
I'm happy that you asked me for help

82
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
at the most difficult time.

83
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,500
The Moon Sword!

84
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,700
Don't worry.

85
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
The Moon Sword is here too.

86
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,940
It's just that it's oppositing the spiritual power in your body.

87
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,020
To prevent you from being devoured,

88
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,300
I used water energy to cast a protection spell on the sword.

89
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,540
It is safe for now.

90
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,250
He Na.

91
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,300
Tell me.

92
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,900
What is his heart made of?

93
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,659
He can pretend to like you

94
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,620
so much that he may die for you.

95
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,500
I never doubted him.

96
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,540
But in the end,

97
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,420
I'm less important than a sword.

98
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,340
If she dies because of me,

99
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,300
I will not live selfishly.

100
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,540
If Master wants to sacrifice an innocent person,

101
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,020
why don't you start with me?

102
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,340
As long as Liu Shao can survive,

103
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,300
God of the Moonlight

104
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,460
has nothing to do with me.

105
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,250
So,

106
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,980
you broke up because of the Moon Sword?

107
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,860
What about you?

108
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,340
You also think all his kindness is fake.

109
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,660
All the things are just a lie.

110
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,900
Since you can't answer,

111
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,420
why don't you find an answer yourself?

112
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,420
Where can I find the answer?

113
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,900
Your heart.

114
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,550
You want to save Liu Shao with your life?

115
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,100
Fine.

116
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,419
Give me back half of your heart first.

117
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,330
There has always been a legend in the demon world.

118
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,860
On the full moon night,

119
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,500
the flute of the Melody Flute

120
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,850
can illuminate a bridge of heart.

121
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,300
As long as you think of the person you want to see the most,

122
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,700
you can walk on the bridge,

123
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,220
walk into the heart,

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,570
and find out the answer you want.

125
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,580
Liu Shao.

126
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,420
Liu Shao.

127
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,140
This is for you.

128
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,660
What are you waiting for?

129
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,620
Take it.

130
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,620
You must keep

131
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,620
the gift I gave you.

132
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,500
What you see and hear in the bridge of heart

133
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,100
is also what you think in your heart.

134
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,620
Silly girl,

135
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,180
you're so easily fooled.

136
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,140
No matter how precious you are,

137
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,580
there's no way you can compare with the Moon Sword.

138
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,860
That's the reflection of your heart.

139
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,570
Do you really want to die for her?

140
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,900
Lu Li, we're done.

141
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,860
Liu Shao.

142
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,940
I'm fine.

143
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,420
I am thinking that

144
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,380
he once swore with his life

145
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,330
to protect me

146
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,740
and save me.

147
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,340
What is his true heart?

148
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,580
What can I believe?

149
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,220
This half of heart that you value so much

150
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
is full of Liu Shao.

151
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,690
Maybe

152
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,940
he was sincere at that time.

153
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,660
No one can control himself while in love.

154
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,580
He can't be fake at most of the time.

155
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,020
I'm fine.

156
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,290
If he's heartless,

157
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,700
I will give him up.

158
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,780
There's nothing to worry about.

159
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,940
I just need time

160
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,860
to take a break.

161
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,660
I can make it.

162
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,620
Liu Shao.

163
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,100
If I miss you,

164
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,340
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

165
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,860
Then don't miss me.

166
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,860
You did so much

167
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,100
just to save Liu Shao.

168
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,180
I can't do anything to the injury

169
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,260
caused by the devouring of the Moon Sword.

170
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,300
However,

171
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,660
I heard that the Bone-Corroding Harp of Immortal Ze Shui from the demon world

172
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,100
has strong healing power.

173
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,780
It might help her.

174
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,210
Master...

175
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,740
Rumor has it that the Bone-Corroding Harp has turned into a demon due to hatred

176
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,460
and is very vicious.

177
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,220
You might die

178
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,980
during the trip.

179
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,780
Master.

180
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,580
I once swore

181
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,050
I will love her and protect her forever

182
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,100
and never regret.

183
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,660
Even if I die,

184
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,980
I must save her.

185
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,940
Master,

186
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,580
remember to take your medicine on time.

187
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,060
Take care.

188
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,380
Your Majesty.

189
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm fine.

190
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,460
But it is not a long-term solution

191
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,180
to treat Miss Liu with the water energy.

192
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,260
Besides, it's very harmful to you.

193
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,660
You can't use it anymore.

194
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,300
If we still have the Bone-Corroding Harp,

195
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,460
we can save Liu Shao.

196
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,940
If we can find the Bone-Corroding Harp...

197
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,020
It won't work.

198
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,010
It is hid in the wasteland

199
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,820
and full of hatred towards our clan.

200
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,460
If you go to find it,

201
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,220
you will be burned to death.

202
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,420
He Na!

203
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,940
He Na!

204
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,740
Lu Li.

205
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,620
How's Liu Shao doing?

206
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,900
She was hurt both physically and mentally.

207
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,780
How can she be doing well?

208
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,900
It was my fault.

209
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,930
You have nothing to explain?

210
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,329
It was all my fault.

211
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,980
There's nothing to explain.

212
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,220
You didn't betray her

213
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,579
nor want to hurt her.

214
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,020
I tried to stop her from pulling out the sword,

215
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,619
but it was too late.

216
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,680
Something else happened after that.

217
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,160
That made her misunderstand.

218
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,100
Do you want to see her?

219
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,780
Of course.

220
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,540
But

221
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,900
if I go to see her now,

222
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,940
I will only bring her trouble.

223
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,690
I can't control

224
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,420
her injury caused by the devouring.

225
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,180
In a few days,

226
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,340
she may pass away.

227
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,900
So I need to find the Bone-Corroding Harp as soon as possible.

228
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,100
How do you know the Bone-Corroding Harp?

229
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,380
You really deserve your reputation as

230
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,500
the General of the Aquatic Demons.

231
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,090
Fu,

232
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,020
I don't deserve

233
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
such a big gift.

234
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,340
You are the famous Mr. Lu Sheng

235
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,100
who once worked with God of the Moonlight.

236
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,180
If I don't bring some gifts at our first meeting,

237
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,100
it may seem that I look down on you

238
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,020
Cut the crap.

239
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,340
Although we are different,

240
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,540
we have the same goal.

241
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,580
I want the Moon Sword.

242
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,460
Can you get it?

243
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,090
As long as you can find the person who broke the Four Seasons Monument,

244
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,220
I'm willing to do it.

245
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,100
I've already found the person.

246
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,870
Good.

247
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,110
Wait for my good news.

248
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,500
The Bone-Corroding Harp

249
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,300
is the magic weapon that Immortal Ze Shui once used.

250
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,820
It can calm one's mind

251
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,810
and heal one's physical and mental trauma.

252
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,540
It can even repair magic weapons.

253
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,660
So where is the Bone-Corroding Harp?

254
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,620
I heard it's in the wasteland.

255
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,460
But for thousands of years,

256
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,500
the world has changed.

257
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,540
The demon world moved mountains to fill the sea.

258
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,300
Ordinary people can't find it.

259
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,500
Then how can we find it?

260
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,780
The Aquatic Demons can feel the Bone-Corroding Harp.

261
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,380
But

262
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,740
we've been cursed by Immortal Ze Shui for generations.

263
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,660
As long as we get close to the Bone-Corroding Harp,

264
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,460
our body will split

265
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,780
and die because of the curse.

266
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,660
What if

267
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,580
I have a way to break the curse?

268
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,100
What is it?

269
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,260
Give me some water energy of the Aquatic Demons.

270
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,620
I can use the pain to feel the direction

271
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,780
and find the harp.

272
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,300
Do you know how painful it is

273
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,180
when your skin splits inch by inch?

274
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,020
He Na.

275
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,220
Don't waste time.

276
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,460
She can't wait.

277
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,170
Liu Shao.

278
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,500
Wait for me.

279
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,900
I will find it.

280
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,420
Liu Shao.

281
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,060
Wait for me.

282
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,930
I wonder if I strangle you to death,

283
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,660
what would my brother look like?

284
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,700
When I find the Moon Sword,

285
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,100
I won't keep you alive.

286
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,740
Fu,

287
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,140
you are doing useless things again.

288
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,820
Since young,

289
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,060
you've put your most important things here.

290
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,500
Even the protection spell is the same.

291
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,340
No one can touch it,

292
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,820
except you.

293
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,420
Since you already knew,

294
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,060
why did you try again and again?

295
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,180
Because I overestimated myself.

296
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,700
I thought maybe in your heart,

297
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,050
I am different.

298
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,140
The Moon Sword

299
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,290
is not something we should touch.

300
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,780
It's not something we can touch?

301
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,340
Then who does it belong to?

302
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,510
Immortal Palace? Marquis Wuyang's Mansion?

303
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,300
Or the Liu Shao lying inside?

304
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,260
I once thought since she could pull out the Moon Sword,

305
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,530
she should be capable.

306
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,260
But now she's dying.

307
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,700
Other than causing you more troubles,

308
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,620
what else can she do?

309
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,930
Get out.

310
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,580
You kicked me out for a woman?

311
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,570
What?

312
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,020
How could your demon energy be injured?

313
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,220
What happened?

314
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:30,900
Fu,

315
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,930
you are not allowed

316
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,700
to touch Liu Shao and the Moon Sword.

317
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,780
This is the energy-mixing pill we got

318
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,120
after we obtained the spirit fire.

319
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,100
Maybe it can help her regain some magic power

320
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,380
to resist the injury caused by the devouring.

321
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,300
You're injured too.

322
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,660
And this trip is full of danger.

323
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,300
This energy-mixing pill

324
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
might be more useful to you.

325
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,540
I am tough.

326
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,510
I may not need these at all.

327
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,020
Give this to her.

328
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,540
In the future,

329
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,420
please take care of her.

330
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,220
Lu Li.

331
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,420
You must come back alive.

332
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,380
I will.

333
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,410
I know someone is waiting for me.

334
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,940
I hope this pill from Lu Li

335
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,690
can give you some more time.

336
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,950
[Ice Rock Lake]

337
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,140
The water energy is working.

338
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,540
The more painful I am,

339
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,020
the closer I get to the Bone-Corroding Harp.

340
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,780
You accepted my water energy.

341
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,020
From now on,

342
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,340
every time you get one inch closer to the Bone-Corroding Harp,

343
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,980
your vitality will be weakened a little.

344
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,140
If you want to get the Bone-Corroding Harp,

345
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,060
you need to be prepared to risk your life.

346
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,060
You're awake.

347
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
Did I fall asleep for a long time again?

348
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,580
Not long.

349
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,790
You're lying again.

350
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,860
Every time you lie,

351
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,220
you don't talk much,

352
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,660
never wasting a word.

353
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,060
And you also lean to the left like this.

354
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,980
You can be seen through easily.

355
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
I'll write it down.

356
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,780
When it comes to lying,

357
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,170
you should learn from Lu Li.

358
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,140
Be confident

359
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,620
and be convincing.

360
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,940
Once,

361
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,060
Lu Li and I...

362
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,340
It's great that I can wake up.

363
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,660
When I fell asleep,

364
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,300
I thought I wouldn't wake up.

365
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,210
Liu Shao.

366
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,980
If you fall asleep again,

367
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,580
you have to remind yourself

368
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,220
that you must wake up.

369
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,180
There is someone who cherishes you,

370
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,290
loves you,

371
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,220
and values your life

372
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,540
more than his.

373
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,810
Do you mean my parents?

374
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,220
There is someone else.

375
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,620
Do you mean you?

376
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,140
Although you are my demon,

377
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,650
but I can't afford

378
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,260
such a powerful demon

379
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,210
like you, the Demon King.

380
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,140
How about me setting you free?

381
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,860
I mean...

382
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,940
Lu Li.

383
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,620
Don't mention him.

384
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,540
I should still have several days left.

385
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,220
Let me

386
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,300
feel the world

387
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,420
wholeheartedly.

388
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,740
Actually, you could woke up

389
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,660
because Lu Li gave you a pill.

390
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,140
It was given by Marquis Wuyang

391
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,860
after you obtained the spirit fire.

392
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,220
It's hot.

393
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
Show me your hands.

394
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,020
Look how badly you are injured.

395
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,180
He was injured at that time.

396
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,290
And he is going to a place

397
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,580
that may kill him.

398
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,820
He's going to get the Bone-Corroding Harp.

399
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,700
That harp

400
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,300
should be able to save you.

401
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,660
Save me?

402
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,460
The Bone-Corroding Harp hates the Aquatic Demons the most

403
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,060
so Lu Li asked me for some of my water energy.

404
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,860
He relies on the pain he feels when getting close to the harp

405
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,820
to determine the location.

406
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,820
The pain he's suffering now

407
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,580
is a thousand times more than mine.

408
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,940
I'm not sure if he can get the Bone-Corroding Harp.

409
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,260
I'm not even sure

410
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,420
if he can survive

411
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,620
when he reaches the Bone-Corroding Harp.

412
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,540
When he came to me,

413
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,580
he only cared about you.

414
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,180
As for the Moon Sword,

415
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,290
he never mentioned it.

416
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,580
Can you send me to him?

417
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,420
Lu Li has my water energy on him.

418
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,660
With it as the introduction

419
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,740
and the power of the Brahma tree as the guide,

420
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
I can send you to him immediately.

421
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,220
But if your injury relapses there,

422
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,300
no one can save you.

423
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,820
Even if I die,

424
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,460
I must go.

425
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,740
I want to ask him again.

426
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,100
Is the Moon Sword more important

427
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,500
or me?

428
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,100
Since you've made up your mind,

429
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,700
I can't stop you.

430
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
But promise me,

431
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,740
you and Lu Li

432
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,940
must come back alive.

433
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,500
The Bone-Corroding Harp.

434
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,060
Looks like Liu Shao was wrong.

435
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,260
If you only want to use Liu Shao,

436
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,820
why would you risk your life to go to the wasteland?

437
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,940
But you have to be careful of your Soul-Devouring Spell.

438
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,380
If you want to save Liu Shao, you must come back alive.

439
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,060
I can't die yet.

440
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,260
Liu Shao.

441
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,170
Liu Shao is waiting for me.

442
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,180
Liu Shao.

443
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,580
Liu Shao.

444
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,650
Liu Shao.

445
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,540
Liu Shao.

446
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,610
Liu Shao.

447
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,460
I won't let you die.

448
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,500
I won't.

449
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,620
Prove it to me.

450
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,580
Prove it?

451
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,060
Okay.

452
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,410
I will save you.

453
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,580
I can't give up.

454
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,500
I will get the Bone-Corroding Harp.

455
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,780
Get the Bone-Corroding Harp

456
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,340
and save...

457
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,820
Save Liu Shao.

458
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,340
Lu Li.

459
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,060
Liu Shao?

460
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,180
Is that you?

461
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
Is it really you?

462
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,540
Am I dreaming?

463
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,610
I have a lot to tell you.

464
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,060
I stopped you from pulling out the Moon Sword

465
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,500
because I didn't want you to get hurt because of it.

466
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,660
If I'm gone,

467
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,060
you must forget me.

468
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,100
Liu Shao.

469
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,260
I like you.

470
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,060
Lu Li.

471
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,290
Look carefully if this is a dream.

472
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,850
Liu Shao.

473
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,140
Why are you here?

474
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,730
Because I have a question for you.

475
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,620
But just now,

476
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,500
you have answered it.

477
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,220
Do you believe me?

478
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,330
I do.

479
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,180
Lu Li.

480
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,060
Even if I don't believe in my eyes and ears,

481
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,900
I will believe you.

482
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,940
No matter what happens in the future,

483
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,260
let's face it together.

484
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,180
OK.

485
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,500
The Bone-Corroding Harp...

486
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,450
What is it saying to me?

487
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,940
It said it hates...

488
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,980
Liu Shao!

489
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,020
Liu Shao!

490
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,500
Protection spell?

491
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,420
What's going on?

492
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,660
Liu Shao!

493
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,180
The man outside

494
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,140
has betrayed you.

495
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,650
But you

496
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,260
still have hope for him.

497
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,540
Remember,

498
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,010
all men in this world

499
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,180
are liars.

500
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,020
Look.

501
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,050
He wants to keep lying to you.

502
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,300
Look at that traitor's face.

503
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,940
Kill him.

504
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,490
Kill him!

505
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,460
Kill him.

506
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,410
Liu Shao.

507
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,260
Don't listen to his sweet words.

508
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,700
He just wants to use you.

509
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,500
Kill him!

510
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,020
Kill him!

511
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,580
Liu Shao.

512
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:02,780
Liu Shao!

513
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,740
Don't hesitate.

514
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,620
Do it!

515
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,300
Liu Shao!

516
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,660
The liar deserves to die!

517
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,780
Liu Shao!

518
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,890
Kill him!

519
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,260
Liu Shao!

520
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,580
Lu Li!

521
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,900
One more time.

522
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,380
You can injure him badly.

523
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,330
No.

524
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,940
Let him pay the price.

525
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,060
Let him experience the feeling of dying.

526
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,900
I believe Lu Li.

527
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,860
He has never betrayed me.

528
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,660
Even if I don't believe in my eyes and ears,

529
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,940
I will believe him.

530
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,780
You are just the resentment left in the harp

531
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,020
by Immortal Ze Shui.

532
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,300
No, you can't be trusted.

533
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,100
I have my own choice.

534
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,100
Liu Shao.

535
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,860
Liu Shao.

536
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,580
Lu Li.

537
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,500
Are you okay?

538
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,180
Lu Li.

539
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,500
I got the Bone-Corroding Harp.

540
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,500
I saw it.

541
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,860
The spiritual power left by Immortal Ze Shui has disappeared.

542
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,820
It can't hurt the Aquatic Demons

543
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,900
or me.

544
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,140
But its healing power should still be there.

545
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,300
Just now,

546
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,740
I think I saw Immortal Ze Shui.

547
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,860
I gave the harp to her.

548
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,460
No.

549
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,860
It wasn't me.

550
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,340
Liu Shao.

551
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,420
Liu Shao.

552
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,900
You're too tired.

553
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,050
You still have the injury casued by the devouring.

554
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,300
Now,

555
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,380
you have to go back for treatment.

556
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,500
It's too dangerous here.

557
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,100
We were separated by the protection spell just now

558
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,620
so I couldn't protect you.

559
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,700
You can't get hurt again.

560
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,180
That voice

561
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
was full of hatred.

562
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,060
I don't want that to happen.

563
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,900
I don't want anything magnificent.

564
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,900
I just want to live with you forever.

565
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,500
But I'm afraid

566
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,380
I can't be with you forever.

567
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,420
When the curse mark return to your palm,

568
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,140
♫On rainy days, wind blows smoke♫

569
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,660
you will die for sure

570
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,230
♫Into circles♫

571
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,210
♫On both sides, I’m chanting♫

572
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,900
Even for one day.

573
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,310
♫The night is sleepless♫

574
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,630
♫The shadows of the moon are incomplete, and people are in love♫

575
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:28,540
Okay.

576
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,940
♫A cocoon of shadows♫

577
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,100
Let's be an ordinary couple

578
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:37,760
♫Your promise, my fate♫

579
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,100
who live an ordinary and happy life.

580
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,550
♫In spring, seasons changed♫

581
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,780
Liu Shao.

582
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,600
♫But my heart is still the same♫

583
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,300
Can you hold on?

584
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,760
♫Back to the sky, the clouds passing by♫

585
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,140
Of course I can.

586
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,330
♫Is like the things we went through♫

587
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,180
Let's find He Na

588
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,140
to fix the Bone-Corroding Harp first.

589
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,660
♫Beside the lake, on the boat♫

590
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,980
♫The moment we passed each other♫

591
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:03,390
♫Can compare with the rest of my life♫

592
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:09,090
♫I look at my love and send it to the clouds outside the garden♫

593
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:16,090
♫Looking at your ageless face at the end of the world♫

594
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:22,720
♫You put the winter snow in your ears and can’t hear it♫

595
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,920
♫When the flowers stop falling, you and I will miss each other♫

596
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,850
♫Everything in the world passes before understanding♫

597
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,960
