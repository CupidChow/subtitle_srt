[Episode 22]

4
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,450
Immortal,

5
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,980
I've heard about

6
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,460
what has happened from Master Shang.

7
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,090
But we can't break the rules in Immortal Palace.

8
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,020
If such an important criminal

9
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,500
wants to leave Litian Temple,

10
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,340
she must be punished by three thunderbolts.

11
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,579
You mean

12
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,100
whether Liu Shao is innocent or not,

13
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,180
she has to be punished with three thunderbolts if she wants to leave, right?

14
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,010
Senior,

15
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,540
I don't think she can stand one thunderbolt now,

16
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,820
let alone three thunderbolts,

17
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,700
Think about it.

18
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,340
If Liu Shao is wronged,

19
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,260
she's already miserable enough now.

20
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,020
Do we have to kill her?

21
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,060
Even if she is wronged,

22
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,579
it's Immortal's responsibility.

23
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,090
Isn't this punishment given to her

24
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,900
because Immortal agreed?

25
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,300
The rules in Immortal Palace cannot be abolished.

26
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,060
Her grievance

27
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,100
is indeed my fault.

28
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,460
I'll be punished

29
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,780
instead of her.

30
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,940
Master Zhuo,

31
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,780
I wonder what will happen

32
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,140
after these three thunderbolts.

33
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,020
Liu Shao will be at your disposal.

34
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,780
The three palaces won't doubt anything.

35
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,220
It is a deal.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,420
♫The wind is getting slower, while the pear flowers are dropping♫

37
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,300
Please seal your spiritual power.

38
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,220
Then, the punishment of thunder can get close to your body.

39
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,520
♫The silver color is cold and sharp♫

40
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,340
Sure.

41
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,700
Within the three whips, there are no class differences.

42
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,100
Everyone in the three palaces can stop me.

43
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,410
♫On the top of Heaven and between reincarnation♫

44
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,020
After three whips when the punishment of thunder has passed,

45
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,940
I will not yield a step.

46
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,550
♫The moon is like snow♫

47
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
Whatever Liu Shao's crime is,

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,700
I am willing to be punished with her.

49

♫You left my heart. You are my fate♫

I will not leave.

89
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,300
Luo Ge,

90
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,860
I will not leave.

91
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,060
Don't think too much.

92
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,980
Have a good rest.

93
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,540
Don't go.

94
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,500
Don't go.

95
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,620
Don't go...

96
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,540
Liu Shao,

97
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,700
the person you've been unwilling to lose is Lu Li.

98
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,820
And Lu Li is also me.

99
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,540
From now on,

100
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,450
Luo Ge is Lu Li.

101
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,220
I'll stand in front of you,

102
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,500
trust you,

103
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,980
and protect you.

104
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:28,780
No.

105
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,060
This must be a dream.

106
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,780
Luo Ge wouldn't say these to me.

107
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,500
Whether it's a dream or not,

108
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,860
I will never let you go again.

109
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,060
Cultivating for

110
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,740
thousands of years lonesomely

111
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,980
is not good at all.

112
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,060
But someone has to experience the loneliness of thousands of years

113
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,140
to protect peace in the Three Realms.

114
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,860
Liu Shao, Liu Shao.

115
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,740
Immortal, Immortal,

116
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,940
how's Liu Shao?

117
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,380
I heard that Liu Shao's energy pill was badly damaged.

118
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,180
Is she okay now?

119
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,420
She's fine now.

120
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,860
She hasn't woken up yet.

121
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,140
Don't disturb her.

122
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,860
Immortal,

123
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,180
I am King Herb aged 10 thousand years.

124
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,060
If a mortal smells me,

125
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,140
all diseases will be cured.

126
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,460
If I stay beside Liu Shao,

127
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,540
with the herbal fragrance accompanying her,

128
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,780
she can recover faster.

129
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,620
Go ahead now.

130
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,940
She has already gone down the mountain.

131
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,100
How could this happen?

132
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,700
I thought I could give you Weirui Grass, and

133
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,940
I could go to Liu Mansion

134
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,020
to see the pear tree at her home.

135
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:43,940
Wait.

136
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,770
I wonder if you have medicine

137
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,180
for internal injury.

138
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,740
The harp lacks a string.

139
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,500
Legend has it that

140
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,740
fairies' hair

141
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,500
can be strings.

142
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,700
Fu.

143
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,500
It doesn't work.

144
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,570
Fu,

145
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,420
I will save you.

146
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,020
Rong,

147
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,580
you also think that the measures I took are drastic.

148
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,260
Although there is a strong possibility that Liu Shao is framed,

149
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,980
I insisted on executing the punishment of thunder.

150
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,860
You think I am too cruel and inhumane,

151
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,580
right?

152
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
Actually, I understand.

153
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,700
Senior, as the master of Palace Wuxie,

154
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,090
you take charge of the penalty.

155
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,540
You only care about rules and regulations.

156
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,180
It is the same for yourself

157
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,340
and for others.

158
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,820
You were not targeting Luo Ge.

159
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,660
No, I was targeting Luo Ge.

160
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,220
I even targeted many people.

161
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,490
I understand.

162
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,780
After my father died,

163
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,510
Palace Chonghua became more and more powerful,

164
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,660
while Palace of Abyssal Mirrors is not as powerful as Palace Chonghua.

165
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
You

166
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,560
were entrusted by my father.

167
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,220
But I am not good enough, and I am laughed at by others,

168
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,620
so you're always against others.

169
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,620
You did it for me.

170
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
You know everything,

171
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,220
but you always pretend not to know.

172
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,940
Rong,

173
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,300
I've had enough

174
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,420
as your senior.

175
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,300
I want to be more than just your junior,

176
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,740
Senior.

177
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,580
Is it two hours?

178
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,340
I'll get you some water.

179
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,340
No need.

180
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,660
Move slowly.

181
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,860
It seems that

182
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,130
you are fine.

183
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,140
Bone-Corroding Harp is

184
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,180
really a healing halidom.

185
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,900
Rumors are true.

186
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,020
Could it be that

187
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,460
I am really...

188
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,780
Does the immortal energy in my body

189
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,060
really belong to

190
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,090
the Immortal Ze Shui who died in the demon clan?

191
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,380
No wonder...

192
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,260
no wonder my brother...

193
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,180
He is him.

194
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,020
You are you.

195
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,580
Fate never starts again.

196
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
I never believe in fate.

197
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,980
Don't believe it either.

198
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,060
Let me see the wound on your hand.

199
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,060
I don't know what's wrong with Bone-Corroding Harp.

200
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,740
It can't even cure my wound.

201
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,460
It is because

202
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,940
you only cared about me.

203
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,180
It's a little itchy.

204
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,340
Actually, I want to ask

205
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,660
what you are going to do

206
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
with Bone-Corroding Harp.

207
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,370
I'll put it back to Palace of Abyssal Mirrors

208
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,460
and pretend nothing has happened.

209
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,340
My brother doesn't want me to know it

210
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,580
because he wants to protect me.

211
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,460
I understand.

212
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,380
I'll protect him too,

213
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,060
secretly.

214
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,650
I understand.

215
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,780
It is just like how I want to protect my brother.

216
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,580
And

217
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,260
I want to protect you

218
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,940
and let you be a happy little fairy.

219
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,220
Fu, look,

220
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
the restriction is lifted.

221
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,660
Does this mean

222
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,420
my brother and Liu Shao are safe?

223
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
He really thinks that I am so old and stupid

224
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,100
that I can't recognize the murderer.

225
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,260
Immortal Luo Ge has sent a message.

226
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,540
He said that he would find out the truth.

227
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,580
What truth?

228
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,740
The truth is that he is bewitched by Liu Shao

229
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,780
and keeps protecting her.

230
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,060
I don't need his medicine.

231
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,740
Return it to him.

232
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,619
Immortal Master has such prejudice against Liu Shao.

233
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,460
Yes.

234
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,339
If I hadn't remembered the past,

235
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,300
I'd probably be the same.

236
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,690
This is...

237
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,020
spell.

238
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,300
Brother!

239
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,660
Brother!

240
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,420
Brother, what's the matter?

241
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,140
I'm fine.

242
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,940
I have...

243
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,620
been busy lately.

244
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,740
I need to calm down.

245
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,060
I'm glad you're fine.

246
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,900
I've heard about

247
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,980
what happened in Litian Temple.

248
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,500
Although we haven't found the murderer,

249
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,380
fortunately, Immortal Master and Liu Shao are fine.

250
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,660
Brother, don't worry too much.

251
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm not worried.

252
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,210
After these,

253
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,530
I will check your schoolwork.

254
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,410
Don't slack off.

255
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,060
Brother,

256
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,860
do you mean

257
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,540
those scriptures that you let me recite?

258
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,980
I've already memorized them.

259
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,420
You can check at any time.

260
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,540
Okay.

261
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,460
I won't disturb you.

262
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,740
I'll go back first.

263
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,450
Tomorrow,

264
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,020
I'll bring you

265
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,810
some fragrance to help you calm down,

266
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,650
OK?

267
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,260
Okay.

268
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
I'm leaving.

269
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,300
I'm devoted to cultivating.

270
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,940
I won't have Lu Li's feelings.

271
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,900
You have his feelings.

272
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,620
I heard that Lu Li was cursed by Soul-Devouring Spell.

273
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,780
He couldn't break it even when he died.

274
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,180
Look, do I have it?

275
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,700
It turns out that

276
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,700
I really have it.

277
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,100
It comes out from the heart

278
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,620
and arrives with love.

279
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,700
Luo Ge!

280
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,620
Liu Shao,

281
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,740
you're finally awake.

282
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,100
Try it and see what soup this is.

283
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,700
You haven't eaten food for a long time.

284
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,540
It is water shield soup.

285
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,540
There are some bamboo shoots

286
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,700
and saury.

287
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,020
In the mortal world,

288
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,180
these food are in season.

289
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,620
I thought you would like it,

290
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,050
so I let you try it.

291
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,700
It's been a while since

292
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,380
I left the mortal world.

293
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,820
The seasonal dishes at home

294
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,940
are made by my mother in person.

295
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,890
My father often said that

296
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,940
with my mother's cooking skills,

297
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,620
even if she broke his legs,

298
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,940
he wouldn't leave home.

299
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,060
I once thought of

300
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,220
bringing a person home and

301
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,980
try my mother's cooking.

302
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,780
Do you still wish to do that?

303
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,660
Immortal

304
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,860
has a conscience.

305
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,380
He went to Litian Temple for you

306
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,500
and got you back.

307
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,580
Do you mean that

308
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,300
Luo Ge sent me back?

309
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,820
Yes.

310
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,940
He even accepted three thunderbolts for you.

311
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,620
Otherwise, Master Zhuo wouldn't let you go.

312
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,700
That silly man

313
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,980
is a bit dull,

314
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,570
but he's still on your side.

315
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,980
He thought he was smart.

316
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,900
But Master knew it right away that

317
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,540
he fed you Weirui Grass.

318
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,930
Master,

319
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,460
are you telling the truth?

320
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,020
Absolutely.

321
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,100
Except for Weirui Grass,

322
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,140
I've written them down on it.

323
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,220
Immortal was awesome that day.

324
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,780
He held you and stepped out of the punishment of thunder.

325
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,020
Luo Ge!

326
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,780
Luo Ge!

327
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,140
Luo Ge!

328
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,900
Luo Ge!

329
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,930
Luo Ge.

330
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,980
I just want to check on you.

331
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,780
I know that

332
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,140
our power is against each other, and

333
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,020
I shouldn't have come to you.

334
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,410
But I'm worried.

335
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,140
I just want to see you.

336
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,380
And Weirui Grass...

337
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,260
I planted it for you.

338
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Wan Sui said you let me have it.

339
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
You suffered three thunderbolts

340
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,100
for me.

341
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,900
You need it more than I do.

342
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,940
Luo Ge,

343
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,860
I just want to see you.

344
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,060
Luo Ge, are you okay?

345
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,540
The truth is not clear yet.

346
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,980
You can't leave.

347
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,100
But if I don't leave,

348
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,740
you'll get hurt.

349
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,540
Do you think I'm you,

350
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,900
who get hurt when you don't pay attention?

351
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,780
I didn't want to.

352
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,140
I didn't expect that fate would mess with us like this.

353
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,900
Lu Li is like this. You are the same.

354
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,900
Are you...

355
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,100
Are you okay?

356
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,610
The conflict of power between us

357
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,980
is not as serious as what Immortal Master has said.

358
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,380
I will investigate this matter.

359
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,180
You don't need to worry about it.

360
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,170
Okay.

361
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,900
I will stay

362
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,780
to investigate

363
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,300
who hurt Immortal Master.

364
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,140
I will prove to everyone that

365
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,380
I'm innocent.

366
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,860
I will prove that

367
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,860
you didn't trust the wrong person for your own good.

368
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,300
What's the matter?

369
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,090
Nothing.

370
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,260
I was just thinking

371
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,940
how you will find the murderer.

372
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,180
This person wants to set me up.

373
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,210
In other words,

374
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,260
he failed to frame me

375
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,180
this time,

376
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,500
he will probably

377
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,900
kill me himself.

378
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,100
So,

379
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,220
let me be the bait.

380
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Let's catch him in a trap.

381
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,380
What do you think?

382
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,420
It is a bad idea.

383
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,420
We've alerted the enemy.

384
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,620
How can you lure him?

385
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,460
You're right.

386
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,980
Maybe he has a personal grudge against Immortal Master.

387
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,020
How about investigating from here?

388
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,620
You don't need to worry about this.

389
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,980
I will investigate it.

390
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,780
Don't act rashly for the time being.

391
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,660
And this person must hate you.

392
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,660
What is this?

393
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,420
This is Wang Bell.

394
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,660
Remember to take it with you.

395
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,460
If you are in danger,

396
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,210
Moon Bell will be able to sense it.

397
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,060
And they will monitor your every move.

398
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,260
Does it mean that

399
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,300
Moon Bell will know whatever I say?

400
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,420
So,

401
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,860
don't talk about me behind my back.

402
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,580
I will speak and act cautiously.

403
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
I will speak less.

404
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,980
These days,

405
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,460
you just need to merge your air with it

406
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,540
and stay close to it.

407
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,930
Stay close to it?

408
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,820
At here?

409
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,740
Okay.

410
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,980
Your brother and future sister-in-law are fine.

411
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,420
Are you relieved now?

412
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,420
My brother must have been seriously injured

413
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,690
this time.

414
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,020
You imagine things

415
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,380
just because he didn't let you in.

416
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,020
At that time,

417
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,570
why didn't you play a little trick

418
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,300
and go inside?

419
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,300
I wanted to go inside.

420
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,580
But when I thought that

421
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,300
my brother lied to me

422
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,500
because he didn't want me to worry about him,

423
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,090
I could put up with everything.

424
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Our little fairy

425
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,580
has grown up.

426
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,100
By the way,

427
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,220
remember to remind Liu Shao.

428
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,300
She must take good care of my brother.

429
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,980
If my brother is unhappy,

430
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,020
or he loses weight,

431
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,020
I will take my brother back.

432
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,300
Take him away.

433
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,940
Are you eating bitter gourds in the mortal world?

434
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,340
Are you silly because you have stayed in Immortal Palace for too long?

435
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,100
You can't even tell the difference between melons and bitter gourds.

436
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,300
But these look bitter.

437
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,620
I've planted all kinds of plants.

438
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,810
This is obviously a melon.

439
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,500
Try it if you don't believe me.

440
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,500
Thank you, Master.

441
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,540
The sisters

442
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,780
are both tricky.

443
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,540
Girl,

444
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,300
your things have all been packed.

445
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,060
In the next few days,

446
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,340
follow Immortal's words.

447
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,610
Where do I live?

448
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,940
Sleep on the floor.

449
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,170
Sleep on the floor?

450
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,820
Here is so big but you want me to sleep on the floor.

451
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,140
What is this?

452
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,860
Mandarin ducks?

453
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,770
Wan Sui is rubbernecking.

454
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
What mandarin ducks?

455
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,940
Well...

456
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,170
they are

457
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,220
ducks.

458
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,820
What are you doing?

459
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,540
At night,

460
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,860
the dew is heavy and there are many mosquitoes.

461
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,780
This

462
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,980
can calm your nerves and repel mosquitoes.

463
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,220
But

464
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,130
the wind is too strong.

465
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,860
I'm afraid it'll blow out the lamp.

466
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,460
This is Immortal Palace.

467
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,740
There's no trouble which is in the mortal world.

468
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,100
Even if

469
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,620
there is no mosquitoes,

470
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,780
it can light up a corner.

471
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,580
Then

472
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,420
it won't be so dark at night.

473
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,140
Night and day are natural.

474
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,660
Why should it be bright at night?

475
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,540
If you follow the laws of day and night,

476
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,500
why do you read and write at night?

477
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,620
Then why do we have the moon?

478
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,220
Isn't the moon natural?

479
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,660
Let me tell you.

480
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,980
When I was young,

481
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,580
my father used to do business.

482
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,860
Every day when he returned home,

483
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,180
it was after midnight.

484
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,380
My mother

485
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,500
put a light

486
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,420
at the door

487
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,740
to tell my father

488
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,580
no matter how late he came back,

489
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,740
someone would be waiting for him at home.

490
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,180
What do you mean by lighting a lamp?

491
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,260
With I lighting such a lamp,

492
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,420
you won't feel lonely.

493
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,180
Well...

494
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,460
As the saying goes,

495
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,300
the moon is bright or dim and she may wax or wane

496
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,780
But I hope

497
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,900
people can be reunited most of the time.

498
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,620
In this way,

499
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,820
you can be a deity earlier.

500
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,140
Liu Shao has returned to Xiyin Mountain.

501
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,620
It looks like you can do nothing with her.

502
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,740
We don't know

503
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,220
who will win now.

504
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,180
You have some guts.

505
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,700
I admire you.

506
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,500
You left Waterside Pavilion.

507
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,620
It looks like Fairy Luo Ning

508
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,820
still can't defeat you.

509
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:06,980
What is this?

510
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,460
It is for my master, Lu Sheng.

511
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,340
Today is his death anniversary.

512
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
No matter what,

513
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,180
he brought me and Lu Li up.

514
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,340
If it weren't because of him,

515
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,140
Lu Li wouldn't be the closest person to me.

516
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,700
Unfortunately,

517
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,900
Lu Li doesn't think you're his closest person.

518
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,380
And now, Lu Li

519
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,540
has become Luo Ge.

520
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,100
You're not in his heart.

521
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,700
It's okay.

522
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,050
I won't let him leave me,

523
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,660
even if I have to make him a walking dead.

524
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,580
As an immortal,

525
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,220
I am trapped by the spell in the mortal world

526
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,940
and can't be free.

527
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,660
Since you're familiar with her scent,

528
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,930
follow her from now on.

529
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,900
If one day

530
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,420
she and I are in danger at the same time,

531
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,020
You can only stay by her side.

532
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,780
Protecting her

533
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,020
is protecting me.

534
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,300
Luo Ge.

535
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,700
With Wang Bell on the side,

536
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,180
it feels like

537
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,340
you are always beside me.

538
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,540
I feel so relieved.

539
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,219
When you are in danger in the future,

540
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,380
you can use your power to activate Wang Bell.

541
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,980
Then, Moon Bell on me can sense it.

542
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,699
By the way,

543
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,570
you said that that person hates me

544
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,260
and she has the aura of my Sun Spirit.

545
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,460
Now it seems that

546
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,460
she got Sun Fragments from you.

547
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,900
Since she could know these

548
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,460
and got the fragments,

549
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,340
she must know you well.

550
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,620
Do you have anyone in mind?

551
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,500
Bai Feng.

552
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:52,929
But...

553
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,780
how could she be so capable?

554
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,340
She can't do it alone.

555
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,740
So we need to get the evidence.

556
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,340
The key is to lure out the person behind her.

557
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,980
This person

558
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,660
is also the one who Xie Lingqi refused to tell us

559
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,980
even if he was thrown into Bone Melting Pool.

560
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,370
I keep my promise and never turn you in.

561
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,340
But you...

562
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,020
but you watch me

563
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,900
suffer here. I can't die or survive.

564
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,220
Why?

565
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,540
Why?

566
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Xie Lingqi,

567
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,660
you know how difficult it is

568
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,220
to deal with the immortal.

569
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,260
You need to give me some time.

570
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,340
You can actually hear me

571
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,780
and answer me.

572
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,140
Are you in Immortal Palace?

573
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,100
Not only am I in Immortal Palace,

574
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,420
but also in a place you can't imagine.

575
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,500
You are so capable.

576
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,700
Let me out!

577
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,060
I have a treasure.

578
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,060
I have Ao Hen's son.

579
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,780
For a thousand years,

580
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,420
Ao Hen fed him countless demon energy.

581
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,700
His demon power is quite great.

582
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,740
Ao Hen is so generous.

583
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,980
Fortunately, we found him first.

584
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,300
If her son wakes up,

585
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,580
I'm afraid he'll be a disaster for Immortal Palace.

586
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,340
Seal him.

587
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,180
Yes.

588
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,420
As long as you cultivate it,

589
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,540
you'll have another master to work for you.

590
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,570
Ao Yin?

591
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,380
That's right.

592
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,380
Matters need to be managed one by one.

593
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,860
After I finish what I am doing,

594
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,820
I will come to save you.

595
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,940
Don't go.

596
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,340
Let me out!

597
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,540
Someone is waiting for me.

598
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,170
A person is waiting for me.

599
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,300
She is waiting for me to save her.

600
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,980
It's been a thousand years.

601
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,900
Immortal,

602
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,980
I picked flowers according to your order.

603
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,540
Put it by Xuan Ling Wood.

604
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,740
I even picked the most powerful one.

605
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,620
Liu Shao has touched it.

606
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,810
I'm afraid there's still her scent on it,

607
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,620
so I asked you to bring some flowers

608
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,900
to remove her scent.

609
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,940
There should not be any other scent

610
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,980
in my place.

611
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,660
Yes.

612
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,300
Xuan Ling Wood is strong.

613
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,580
The flowers need to be wrapped with magic power.

614
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,850
Otherwise, it will burn the flowers.

615
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,500
Yes.

616
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,490
I'm incompetent.

617
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,620
I'll change it now.

618
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,900
No need.

619
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,380
Your cultivation is nothing more than this.

620
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,820
You may leave.

621
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,890
Yes.

622
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,700
You said Luo Ge asked you to get close to Xuan Ling Wood

623
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,860
and let you use your power.

624
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,460
He seldom talks so much to me,

625
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,020
so I was sure he was weird

626
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,580
and didn't use my power on purpose.

627
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
That's why I was burnt.

628
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,020
He's suspicious of you.

629
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,500
No way.

630
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,500
I did a good job.

631
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,380
You must have heard about Xuan Ling Wood absorbing demon energy

632
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,700
from Lu Sheng, right?

633
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,380
My master mentioned Immortal Palace,

634
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,060
so I was especially careful.

635
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,100
The power in your body

636
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,860
is mixed with Ao Hen's demon energy.

637
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,100
You burnt yourself deliberately

638
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,220
to prevent

639
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,060
Xuan Ling Wood from absorbing your spiritual power,

640
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,100
and Luo Ge from finding out that

641
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,380
you're related to the demonic realm,

642
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,380
right?

643
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,140
Then I wasn't wrong at all.

644
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,460
You were wrong,

645
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,140
totally wrong.

646
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,620
Let me ask you.

647
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,900
What does Xuan Ling Wood need to grow?

648
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,060
Immortals water it with spiritual power.

649
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,060
It doesn't need water.

650
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,940
Ridiculous.

651
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,300
No matter how the world change,

652
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,140
water is the origin of everything.

653
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,580
Even if he is Luo Ge,

654
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,420
he still needs to use his power to create rain

655
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,340
to nourish Xuan Ling Wood.

656
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,740
When you got close to Xuan Ling Wood,

657
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,420
there should be a lot of dew

658
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,500
on the leaves.

659
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,460
These

660
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,410
are made of Luo Ge's spiritual power.

661
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,100
As long as it's on you,

662
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,300
it can still take away your power

663
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,180
without you noticing it.

664
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,020
So,

665
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,700
he was testing me.

666
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,380
It was not testing.

667
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,860
He took such evidence from you

668
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,060
because he was certain that you were the suspect.
