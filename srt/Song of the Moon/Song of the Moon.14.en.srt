4
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:56,180
You want to stop me from being born.

5
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,580
No one of you can stop me!

6
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,340
Oh no.

7
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,530
Something bad will happen.

8
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,220
Can't I stop you either?

9
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,419
Look!

10
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,140
This is...

11
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,700
Who is that?

12
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,780
Lord Wuxiang.

13
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,090
It is Lord Wuxiang.

14
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,060
Ge is out.

15
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,860
Look, it has been suppressed.

16
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,140
Amazing.

17
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,260
As expected of Immortal.

18
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,100
Yes.

19
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Great!

20
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,530
Great.

21
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,580
We're saved.

22
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,060

25
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,500
Ge,

26
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,980
congratulations on your out.

27
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,500
After a thousand years,

28

29
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,300
finally has an immortal.

30
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,290
It's happiness to Immortal Palace

31
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,260
and a blessing to the Three Realms.

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,260
How did this disaster

33
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,370
happen today?

34
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,380
Fix the Protection Spell,

35
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,450
reinforce the formation,

36
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,060
check the casualties,

37
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,380
and find out who she is.

38
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,940
What's going on?

39
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,140
What happened?

40
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,580
How did this happen?

41
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,860
Why is it getting dark?

42
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,980
Look.

43
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,100
Look!

44
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,220
Yes.

45
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,940
Look.

46
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,900
The deeper the color of the glazed fruit gets,

47
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,420
the fewer restrictions Immortal Palace has on us.

48
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,020
It looks like the cracks of Four Seasons Monument

49
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,100
will be deepened.

50
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,940
I heard that

51
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,340
it was a human boy.

52
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,900
He killed Ao Hen

53
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,140
with the Moon Sword.

54
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,260
But he can't save his own life

55
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,380
I play to celebrate that in this life, I could meet

56
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,860
a man who used Moon Sword

57
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,900
with a mortal body.

58
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,940

59
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,140
you are the only one

60
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,060
who is worthy to appreciate this song.

-It is Lord Wuxiang. -Lord Wuxiang.

Ge,

76
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,180
you came back after experiencing hardships.

77
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,540
There shouldn't be any trace of the mortal world.

78
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,930
Why are you so distracted?

79
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
I experienced hardships with my heart.

80
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,860
It's inevitable to be affected.

81
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,980
I will clean it myself

82
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,260
and return to the deity whose heart is

83
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,380
without anger or worries.

84
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,780

85
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,500
you've been cultivating for a thousand years,

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
and you have always been self-disciplined.

87

I

88
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
rest assured.

89
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,930
Brother.

90
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,050
Brother,

91
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,090
you're back.

92
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,330

[Immortal Palace, Litian Temple]

95
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
When we were busy fixing Four Seasons Monument,

96
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,460
Ao Hen managed to break the Ziji Shield

97
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,620
and led the demons to come out.

98
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,100
I think

99
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,620
this must have something to do with

100
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,220
Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

101
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,460
And the one who played Bone-Corroding Harp

102
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,220
is a disciple in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion,

Liu Shao.

104
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,780
Did you really play Bone-Corroding Harp?

105
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:49,980
Liu Shao,

106
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,620
the Immortal is asking you.

107
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,580
Lu Li and I

108
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,460
got Bone-Corroding Harp back

109
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,500
together.

110
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,980
When the string was broken,

111
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
we fixed it together.

112
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,940
This is a spirit vein only a high-level demon has.

113
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,780
It can only be extracted in extreme pain.

114
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,530
If the demon doesn't have an ulterior motive,

115
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,540
why would he take such a risk?

116
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,650
So,

117
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
who gave it to you?

118
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,740
It's a spirit vein.

119
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,700
Isn't it hair?

120
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,780
The Zeshui Hair from ten thousand years ago

121
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,530
was found by you.

122
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,020
It was not easy.

123
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,500
Could it be that He Na took his spirit vein out

124
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,460
to save me?

125
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,660
Look at her.

126
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,890
Her words don't match.

127
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,700
She is out of her mind.

128
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,410
Liu Shao.

129
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,060
When I got it,

130
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,180
it was just said to be a single hair.

131
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,700
You're so eloquent and full of excuses.

132
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,580
How dare you say you are not the spy?

133
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,140
Liu Shao was hunted by Ao Hen before

134
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,060
and had nowhere to hide.

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,340
How could she be a spy?

136
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,580
Don't frame her.

137
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,660
That's right.

138
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,980
Is the Immortal Palace still unreasonable?

139
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,420
Fatty, Xue.

140
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,620
I think

141
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,860
you disciples

142
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,930
have been taught badly.

143
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,940
You think that the Immortal Palace

144
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,860
should be indebted to you and owe you

145
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,380
just because a few people died.

146
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,620
Immortal,

147
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,340
why don't we inform the Three Realms that

148
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,740
this disaster was caused by the rebellion of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion,

149
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,940
forbid people from mourning for Marquis Wuyang's Mansion,

150
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,580
and forbid them from accepting people's worship

151
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,180
to show immortal power?

152
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,420
Yes.

153
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,940
Aren't our lives lives?

154
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,020
-Yes. -Yes.

155
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,340
Aren't our lives lives?

156
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,780
How can you do that?

157
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,620
What did they do wrong?

158
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,340
Under Four Seasons Monument,

159
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,300
Lord sacrificed himself.

160
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,300
Many seniors died.

161
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,180
They risked their lives to fight against demons.

162
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,020
What did they do wrong?

163
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:07,980
How dare you!

164
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,860
What?

165
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,740
Did I say anything wrong?

166
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,540
All of us,

167
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,180
from the first day we came to Marquis Wuyang's Mansion,

168
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,540
we were taught

169
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,060
to suppress demons and protect all living beings.

170
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,740
Just because of Immortal Palace's

171
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,780
suspect for no reason,

172
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,660
do you want to ruin our lives?

173
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,580
Then what is the difference

174
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,900
between you and those demons

175
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,660
who kill everyone

176
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180

Look!

346
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,100
How is this possible?

347
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,260
Lu Li,

348
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,210
is it you?

349
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,900
How dare a human

350
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,060
offend Immortal?

351
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:17,940
Lu Li...

352
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,380
Immortal,

353
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,050
why does your face...

354
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,340
You look exactly like that mortal.

355
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,260
No matter if I have an appearanc, I am still me.

356
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,570
What are your doubts?

357
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,060
When Ge was promoted to Immortal,

358
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,020
he received mortal things,

359
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,540
so he looks like a mortal.

360
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,020
This is a good omen.

361
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,940
Go back first.

362
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,100
I have something to discuss with Immortal Master.

363
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,220
Yes.

364
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,700
Four Seasons Monument is made by the God of the Sun.

365
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,810
Her blood can stabilize Four Seasons Monument.

366
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,580
It only means...

367
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:35,980
Ge,

368
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,460
do you suspect Liu Shao is...

369
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,060
Yes.

370
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,060
Sun Spirit is in her body.

371
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,060
If that's the case,

372
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,170
I really underestimated her.

373
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,340
I thought she only had the fragment of the spirit.

374
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,660
I didn't expect that she would be the heir to Sun Spirit.

375
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,220
She can walk out of the Bone Melting Pool.

376
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,850
It shows that she is upright.

377
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,220
There must be another reason

378
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,820
for Bone-Corroding Harp.

379
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:05,860
Lu Li.

380
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,620
Lu Li,

381
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,380
you're Lu Li, right?

382
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,180
You have Sun Spirit in your body.

383
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,900
Stay in Xiyin Mountain,

384
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,380
and don't go back to the mortal world.

385
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,140
I won't.

386
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,140
I'll go wherever you go.

387
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,940
I am the Immortal of Xihui Mountain,

388
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,290
Luo Ge.

389
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,140
No,

390
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,580
you're Lu Li.

391
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,900
You're Lu Li.

392
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,780
Lu Li!

393
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,580
You are Lu Li.

394
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,940
Love is a sin.

395
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,500
Why are you doing this?

396
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,460
Liu Shao,

397
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,420
are you really not going back with us?

398
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,180
No.

399
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,860
There are some things

400
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,180
I must figure out.

401
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,700
Sister-in-law,

402
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,540
do you really think that cold Immortal

403
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,660
has anything to do with my boss?

404
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,860
Impossible.

405
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,540
If they are related,

406
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,260
how could he let you get into Bone Melting Pool?

407
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,100
That's right.

408
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,860
Look at your injury.

409
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,410
But after the Moon Sword left Lu Li,

410
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,460
it immediately took Luo Ge as his master

411
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,620
and got controlled by him.

412
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,380
Well,

413
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,180
that only means Moon Sword

414
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
is not a good thing.

415
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,300
Exactly.

416
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,340
It hurt you badly

417
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,700
and killed Lu Li.

418
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,660
I don't think it treats you as its owners.

419
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,780
It took Luo Ge as its owner obediently

420
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,540
just because Luo Ge is too powerful,

421
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
But Immortal Luo Ge

422
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,420
came out

423
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,540
just after Lu Li died.

424
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,700
Besides,

425
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,290
he has the same face as Lu Li.

426
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
How could a mortal Lu Li

427
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,930
affect Immortal?

428
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,220
So,

429
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,660
I must investigate it.

430
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,340
What if...

431
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,500
What if...

432
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,460
Lu Li is still alive?

433
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,300
Liu Shao,

434
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,060
we've already seen it.

435
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:17,740
No.

436
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,420
I've been taught a lesson before.

437
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,660
What I see may not be true.

438
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,420
I'm not going back.

439
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,170
Fattie,

440
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,860
I'll leave Xue to you.

441
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:32,460
Remember,

442
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,010
you must work hard when you go back.

443
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,980
Don't let the people in the Three Realms look down on us.

444
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Of course.

445
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,980
Brothers and sisters,

446
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,940
let's go back.

447
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,460
Lord has died.

448
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,860
The human world

449
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,140
has to rely on us.

450
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,340
Sister-in-law,

451
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,700
take care.

452
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,260
Senior Liu Shao, take care.

453
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,020
Take care.

454
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,300
We're leaving.

455
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,300
How can Immortal Luo Ge

456
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,340
have the same face as Lu Li?

457
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,060
Is he really alive?

458
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,980
That is where the three palaces are.

459
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,460
This is Xiyin Mountain.

460
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,300
Leader Zhuo,

461
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,420
this place is

462
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,700
more elegant than other places.

463
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,220
This is Immortal Luo Ge's sister,

464
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,660
Luo Ning's residence.

465
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,500
In the Immortal Palace,

466
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,660
only her room is by the water.

467
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,540
Is this the person who played Bone-Corroding Harp?

468
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,300
I want to hear

469
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,540
what's special about her playing.

470
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,460
Zhuo,

471
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,500
don't get involved in this.

472
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,420
Otherwise,

473
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,140
I will remove the beads on the golden crown

474
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,900
of Leader Shang

475
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,220
and play with them.

476
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,660
This round is difficult

477
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,900
for you.

478
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,660
Take care.

479
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,620
That day,

480
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,300
you played the harp, right?

481
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,060
Play it again, and

482
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,260
let me listen to it.

483
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,100
Brahma Song?

484
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,340
But Bone-Corroding Harp

485
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,500
was taken away by the Immortal Palace.

486
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,580
How can I play it?

487
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,860
Wind chimes?

488
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,220
Where did you

489
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,100
learn this song?

490
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I didn't learn it on purpose.

491
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,860
I just

492
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,060
saw

493
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,380
an old tree blooming.

494
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,900
Then, I suddenly got it.

495
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
I feel that

496
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,060
it's a song created before.

497
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,980
It sounds very familiar,

498
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,710
and it's especially nice.

499
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,540
I didn't expect that

500
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,780
you would be not only beautiful,

501
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,090
but also intelligent.

502
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,140
I dare not.

503
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,450
My name is Liu Shao.

504
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,570
You must be

505
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,740
the legendary Fairy Luo Ning, right?

506
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,300
If anyone bullies you,

507
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,020
just tell them my name.

508
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,180
Why are you injured?

509
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,500
Let's go.

510
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,420
Come in with me.

511
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,940
Let me put on

512
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,570
the new healing dew I made for you.

513
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,460
I promise you'll be fine.

514
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,340
After that,

515
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,980
I'll show you around, okay?

516
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,730
Let's go.

517
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,020
When I was blocked during my promotion,

518
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,260
I had to seal myself here

519
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,540
and cut out half of my heart

520
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,380
and send it to the mortal world to experience hardships.

521
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,780
Is it because

522
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,580
my half heart had a mortal body

523
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,450
that I have this face?

524
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,620
Since you've come back from hardships,

525
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,060
why bother about the shadow in the human world?

526
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,340
What happened on the way

527
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,740
is not important.

528
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,700
The result is your practice.

529
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,060
But Liu Shao

530
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,860
is the obstacle on your way to becoming a deity.

531
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,140
You must not let her stay by your side.

532
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,980
Are you afraid that the history of ten thousand years ago would repeat itself?

533
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,580
Or do you also think that

534
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,900
Luo Ge will be bewitched by beauty?

535
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,660
But what in her body

536
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,170
is the power of God of the Sun.

537
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,020
How can I not worry?

538
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,700
That's why I let her stay.

539
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,180
Her blood has the power of the God of the Sun.

540
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,740
It can help us stabilize Four Seasons Monument.

I think you need

this gift.

571

What is this?

00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,140
This

is the new fragrance I developed.

and drop a drop on your wrist.

you can have a sweet dream.

you can meet the person you like

you miss him,

bought you good medicine.

588
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,540
It will definitely cure your cough.

589
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,300
You are acting like a woman.

590

Fu,

591
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,100
if you dare to offend me again,

592
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,180
I'll destroy your demon power of a thousand years.

593

Luo Ge has gone through hardships and become immortal.

594
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,090
He is investigating the spy in Lusitai.

595
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,220
I have investigated the audience

596
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,980
on that day.

597
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,220
including the disciples in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

598
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,900
That day,

599
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,140
Liu Shao was about to finish mending Four Seasons Monument.

600
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,260
But unexpectedly,

601
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,620
she flipped the harp

602
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,210
and played another tune for no reason

603
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,180
and hit Four Seasons Monument.

604
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,100
The melody I played

605
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,660
can attack and destroy things.

606
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,420
As soon as I play it,

607
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,820
clouds will be pierced and stones will be broken.

608
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,700
Since Liu Shao is going to damage Four Seasons Monument,

609
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,860
why did she repair it before?

610
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,220
It doesn't make sense.

611
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,100
I developed so many cracks with the sound of my musical instrument.

612
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,060
With just one strike of Moon Sword,

613
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,300
Four Seasons Monument will be opened.

614
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,780
What about Moon Sword?

615
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,300
Who was using it?

616
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,650
It's a disciple of Marquis Wuyang,

617
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:35,929
Lu Li.

618
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,969
Lu Li...

619
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,420
is my body when I was experiencing hardships.

620
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,500
Back then,

621
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,020
in order to save Liu Shao and other people,

622
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,420
he used Moon Sword as a mortal

623
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,540
and was eventually devoured by the sword.

624
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,900
But Lu Li didn't use Moon Sword

625
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,690
to break Four Seasons Monument.

626
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,020
Instead, he used it to kill Ao Hen.

627
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,500
At least Lu Li has held Moon Sword.

628
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,180
You...

629
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,180
are not enough.

630
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,660
Except for Lu Li,

631
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,020
I have another disciple in Immortal Palace.

632
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,500
She'll try to get close to Luo Ge.

633
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,980
Lu Li is dead,

634
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,340
but the Moon Sword is still there.

635
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,540
It can't be counted as a failure.

636
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,300
But for you, it's hard to say.

637
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,500
Do you really think that

638
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,460
Luo Ge can't find anything?

639
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,820
Two magical weapons appeared at the same time.

640
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,060
Ziji Shield was also broken.

641
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,740
It should be specially designed by someone.

642
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,700
In my opinion,

643
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,820
Ao Hen

644
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,660
is probably just a pawn.

645
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,460
Liu Shao showed her magic power.

646
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,210
Sun Spirit fragments should be scattered around here.

647
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,890
Find them quickly.

648
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,850
Keep an eye on Liu Shao too.

649
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,780
Yes.

650
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,530
There must be traces of the spell on Sun Spirit fragments.

651
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,500
They'll know it's you once they investigate it.

652
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,580
You're going to be exposed,

653
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,100
but you come here

654
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,180
and talk with me happily.

655
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,180
About this,

656
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,420
don't worry.

657
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,210
My spy in the Immortal Palace

658
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,690
will give me Sun Spirit Fragments.

659
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,460
I have such a good spy.

660
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,500
How can I care about Immortal Luo Ge?

661
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,420
Instead, you need to worry about

662
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,980
Liu Shao.

663
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,020
You must kill her,

664
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,620
lest she really repairs Four Seasons Monument.

665
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,700
Your brother protects her,

666
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,140
while you want to kill her.

667
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,940
Since you brothers are not united,

668
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,860
why don't you replace him?

669
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,620
Ao Hen is dead.

670
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,020
The Demon Realm is in chaos.

671
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,260
This is your chance to win over the people's hearts.

672
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,020
As for the Demon King,

673
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,540
how can you, a half-demon, talk about it?

674
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,370
What's wrong?

675
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,180
Don't you like what your brother looks like now?

676
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,260
No.

677
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,340
I like it.

678
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,980
I like it

679
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,340
whatever my brother looks like.

680
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,220
But...

681
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,980
my brother is too pretty.

682
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,060
I'm afraid my brother's face

683
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,300
will cause trouble.

684
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,420
Let me do it.

685
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,180
I'll do it.

686
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,420
So...

687
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,060
Just say it.

688
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,420
There's no need to beat about the bush

689
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,820
between us.

690
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,100
Brother,

691
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,980
have some tea.

692
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,900
I

693
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,300
made a new friend.

694
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,700
She is very good-looking

695
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:31,860
She treats me well too.

696
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,340
But pitifully,

697
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,100
her life is so miserable.

698
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,140
Brother,

699
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,940
do you really not remember

700
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,180
what happened to you

701
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,100
when you were in the mortal world?

702
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,180
Why should I remember it?

703
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,260
But when you don't remember it,

704
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,140
someone who was with you remembers it.

705
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,340
What should we do?

706
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,140
Debt in the mortal world should be solved in the mortal world.

707
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,300
Even if there is something unfinished,

708
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,780
for us immortals, it's nothing.

709
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,580
Brother,

710
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,500
we are really brothers and sisters.

711
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,860
We have the same thought.

712
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,020
So,

713
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,100
I helped you

714
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,580
trap her in her dream with fragrance.

715
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,010
When she is there,

716
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,300
she can be with you...

717
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,260
no...

718
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,420
you in the mortal world

719
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,940
happily.

720
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,580
She can't bother you anymore.

721
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,410
♫How many rain seasons and rains do I need to see♫

722
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,020
What do you think?

723
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,990
♫Before meeting you♫

724

Is it pretty?

725

Yes.

726

♫I stay there♫

I'll show you something fun.

744

Follow me.

745
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,570
What is it?

746
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,700
Shush.

747
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,180
Rabbit!

748
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,770
Where did you get it?

749
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,380
What's its name?

750
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,940
It's our food for tonight.

751
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,100
No way.

752
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,940
Give it to me.

753
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,630
♫How many rain seasons and rains do I need to see♫

Just kidding.

00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,300
If you like it,

756
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,500
I'll get you a load of rabbits.

757

♫Before meeting you♫

758
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,260
We will keep them in the mountain.

759
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,300
Let's

760
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,860
be a pair of rabbit kings.

761
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,740
♫I am destined to sink to the bottom of the sea♫

00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm afraid that

764
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,980
you can't even catch one
