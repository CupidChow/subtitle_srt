[Episode 26]

4
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,340
Let's see how Luo Ge is doing.

5
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,420
This tribulation

6
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,820
is not his only.

7
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,500
He must survive it.

8
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,340
Good.

9
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,930
If he can't survive the tribulation,

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,220
you must get the sixth talisman pearl.

11
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,020
But with the sixth talisman pearl taken,

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,460
I'm afraid that Liu Shao...

13
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,900
I'll go bring the Ancient Herb and the Glazed Fruit

14
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,940
to her.

15
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,500
Master Zhuo.

16
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,020
We're counting on you.

17
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,540
Do you want to use the formation to suppress me?

18
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,820
It's not that easy.

19
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,740
These are the talisman pearls from three days ago.

20
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,700
And you thought it would work on me?

21
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,980
Liu Shao, come out for lunch.

22
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,730
Liu Shao.

23
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,380
Liu Shao.

24
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,300
Where did she go?

25
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,100
Liu Shao is not here.

26
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,940
Wang Jian didn't come either.

27
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,300
Did something happen?

28
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,060
As long as Luo Ge is not here,

29
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,100
you can't

30
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,220
fight with me.

31
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,660
Looks like there's no time.

32
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,610
Liu Shao.

33
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,620
Sorry for my offense.

34
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,820
Qiuxian.

35
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,660
Hold on.

36
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,010
The talisman pearl will be here soon.

37
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,500
Change the formation.

38
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,780
Then I'll start with you.

39
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,020
Immortal Master!

40
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,140
Immortal Master!

41
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Don't come over.

42
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,900
Or we'll all die together.

43
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,420
Rong.

44
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,740
Rong.

45
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,610
Sister.

46
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,650
Let go!

47
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,420
Let's die together!

48
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,090
Master!

49
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,370
Rong.

50
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:12,980
Immortal Master.

51
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,700
Immortal Master.

52
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:15,900
Immortal Master.

53
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:17,900
Here.

54
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,140
Immortal Master.

55
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
Are you all right?

56
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,580
Take him down to heal his wounds.

57
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,220
Immortal Master.

58
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,100
That's strange.

59
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,140
Why was there a change in heaven and earth just now?

60
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,780
You are...

61
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,300
Me?

62
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,659
Have I seen you somewhere before?

63
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,580
Was it in the mortal world or the Immortal Palace?

64
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,820
I knew the great liar Lu Li in the mortal world.

65
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,860
I know Luo Ge, who is worse than the big liar Lu Li

66
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,540
in the Immortal Palace.

67
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,540
That's all me.

68
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,540
How dare you say that?

69
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,820
Liu Shao suffers the most.

70
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,740
She's so simple.

71
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,020
But you keep messing with her.

72
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,740
Have you seen Liu Shao?

73
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,890
Where is she?

74
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,140
Right there.

75
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,180
Psycho is bullying her.

76
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,540
Wait for me.

77
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,500
Did you find out?

78
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,100
Yes.

79
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,530
These days,

80
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,140
the demon who is desperately collecting spirit energy,

81
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,940
and

82
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,980
the fortune-teller

83
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,690
who clashed with His Majesty and Fu

84
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,570
were all ordered by Ao Yin.

85
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,780
Ao Yin?

86
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,460
The son of Ao Hen?

87
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,380
As far as I know,

88
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,780
Xie Lingqi brought Ao Yin's demon energy back

89
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,940
to the Immortal Palace.

90
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,450
But I don't know

91
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,330
how he escaped.

92
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,940
Could it really be him?

93
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,340
Here.

94
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,820
Don't listen to that grass demon.

95
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,500
I just fought with that demon

96
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,220
for too long

97
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,100
and got a bit exhausted.

98
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,210
Trust me.

99
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,300
No matter if I'm immortal,

100
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,820
I have to protect the people around me.

101
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,820
This is more like it.

102
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,580
More like what?

103
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,700
Immortal Luo Ge.

104
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,860
Do you want me to be Luo Ge so much?

105
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,810
Whether you are an immortal,

106
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,180
a mortal

107
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,020
or a liar,

108
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,060
as long as I can be with you

109
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,220
and listen to your heartbeat,

110
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,340
my heart is filled with joy.

111
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,620
I'm glad you like it.

112
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,100
If there is danger again,

113
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,900
hide behind me.

114
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,180
I can learn magic again.

115
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,060
Okay?

116
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,650
Good.

117
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,060
I wish I could hide behind you too.

118
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,140
Something's wrong!

119
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,420
Liu Shao.

120
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,380
Immortal Luo Ge.

121
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,860
Wang Jian has been captured by the great demon.

122
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,580
Luo Ning.

123
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,620
I've found many tonic products.

124
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,060
You can pick something you like with me tomorrow.

125
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,420
You will be cured.

126
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,260
Tonic?

127
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,300
If Luo Ge doesn't come back in two days,

128
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,780
I'll have to take the last talisman pearl from Liu Shao.

129
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,820
Sister.

130
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,420
What is it?

131
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,420
Liu Shao

132
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,580
asked for the Phoenix Tears from me.

133
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,420
The Phoenix Tears?

134
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,020
Three days later,

135
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,260
Luo Ge will be back to who he was.

136
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,180
But

137
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,300
can I ask you for something?

138
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,860
Go ahead.

139
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,860
The Phoenix Tears?

140
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,220
Do you want to forget Luo Ge?

141
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,060
I want him to forget me.

142
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,890
Forget that he ever loved me.

143
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,500
Forget that I appeared

144
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,660
and left.

145
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,300
Liu Shao is very sober.

146
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,260
She has already figured out her fate.

147
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,450
But can Phoenix Tears

148
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,330
break the Soul-devouring Curse?

149
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,650
Maybe

150
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,130
he can forget about Liu Shao for a while.

151
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,100
Maybe the Soul-devouring Spell will never strike again.

152
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,260
This is Glazed Fruit.

153
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,620
It can help you recover.

154
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,780
And this.

155
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,110
[Phoenix Tears]

156
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,940
Even if the Phoenix Tears works,

157
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,220
Luo Ge can't be able to

158
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,260
pass through the tribulation in a couple of days.

159
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,940
But it should make Luo Ge

160
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,060
get out of the present state faster.

161
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
If he comes back

162
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,820
and knows about what you've done…

163
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,740
He'll probably

164
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,580
kill me.

165
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,860
This…

166
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,860
Fu.

167
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,620
This is the tonic you found for me?

168
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,620
That's right.

169
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,740
Luo Ning,

170
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,500
you were born in the Immortal Palace.

171
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Your vitality is pure.

172
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,530
If it were ordinary demon energy,

173
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,660
you couldn't use it.

174
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,020
So I've found some human masters.

175
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,420
See which one has pure spiritual energy,

176
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,180
we will take his vitality

177
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,380
to heal you.

178
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,940
So

179
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,420
you've been running around these days

180
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,980
for this?

181
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,660
Of course.

182
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,180
Luo Ning.

183
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,260
I told you.

184
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,220
I will cure you.

185
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,540
But I also told you

186
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,620
not killing innocent people is my bottom line.

187
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,380
I know that.

188
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,700
That's why I didn't take their vitality.

189
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,780
See which one

190
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,940
you think can heal you,

191
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,380
we'll take his vitality then.

192
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:58,940
Is that okay?

193
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,100
I don't want to.

194
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,050
Release them.

195
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,780
I can't.

196
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,340
I said to release them.

197
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,660
Or else

198
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,420
I'll never talk to you again.

199
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,100
Fine.

200
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,620
Luo Ning.

201
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,500
I'll do as you say.

202
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
I'll release them now.

203
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,660
Okay?

204
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,580
They're here.

205
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,860
Brother.

206
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,420
Brother.

207
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,130
This is Luo Ning,

208
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,860
your sister.

209
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,620
This is Liu Shao,

210
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,420
your future sister-in-law.

211
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,020
Liu Shao.

212
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,020
What's wrong with brother?

213
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,460
He hasn't recovered yet.

214
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,820
But he should be soon.

215
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,020
You, on the other hand,

216
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,940
why do you look so bad?

217
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,220
And what's with these people?

218
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,450
Brother.

219
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,650
B… Brother.

220
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,580
He wants to take our vitality.

221
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
He... he's got us

222
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,740
to treat the girl.

223
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,540
I didn't realize she was

224
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,620
your sister.

225
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,140
Immortal.

226
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,420
Luo Ning was accidentally attacked.

227
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,020
Her immortal energy is severely damaged.

228
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,020
I just want to find some people

229
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,260
to repair her vitality.

230
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,540
I didn't mean to kill anyone.

231
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,380
If you did kill someone,

232
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,420
I wouldn't forgive you.

233
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,380
Neither would my sister.

234
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,500
You know your sister.

235
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,820
I didn't

236
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,220
think it through.

237
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,260
I'll let them go

238
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
as Luo Ning wants.

239
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,300
Brother.

240
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,650
Brother.

241
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,690
Immortal, I'm sure you have a better way

242
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,900
to cure Luo Ning, right?

243
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,780
Brother.

244
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,020
I'm fine.

245
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,660
It takes a lot of spiritual energy to heal the vitality damage.

246
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,300
This...

247
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,900
should be able to heal you.

248
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,620
It's the most precious treasure of my clan,

249
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,580
the Glazed Fruit.

250
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,380
I heard the only one

251
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,690
has been sent to the Immortal Palace.

252
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,820
I didn't expect

253
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,980
you had it.

254
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,500
With this,

255
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
you'll be cured for sure.

256
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,460
Liu Shao.

257
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,020
Since you've given me this treasure,

258
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,700
I'll let Fu continue to help with my healing.

259
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,619
You must take care of my brother for me.

260
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,210
Don't worry.

261
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,450
The demon called Fu

262
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,859
doesn't look like a good guy.

263
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,980
Then why didn't you bring Luo Ning back?

264
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,859
If I bring her back,

265
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,540
I don't know how to heal her with the Glazed Fruit.

266
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,260
By the way,

267
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,260
where did you get the Glazed Fruit?

268
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,900
From the people at the Immortal Palace.

269
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,220
They said to give it to you.

270
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,580
I don't know if it works.

271
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,100
You've saved it

272
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,940
for your beloved one to help him survive the tribulation.

273
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,140
You made me pick a leaf for you.

274
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,570
Sooner or later, I'll become bald grass.

275
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:55,930
Good.

276
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,220
Now good.

277
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,420
I've had hair loss.

278
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,330
I'd better grow some Polygonum Multiforum.

279
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,780
What's wrong?

280
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,220
You're like wild horses.

281
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,140
What's going on?

282
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,460
There's a flood in the east.

283
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,260
Maybe

284
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,420
it's going to flood this area.

285
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,050
We're going to the city and taking shelter.

286
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,820
Yes, that's right.

287
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,220
It's not a peaceful world these days.

288
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,340
You guys should pack up too.

289
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,660
Let's go.

290
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,700
Does it

291
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,780
have anything to do with me?

292
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,260
If I say yes,

293
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,700
what would you do?

294
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,900
What would I do?

295
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,580
What can I do?

296
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,940
I can't even protect my sister and the people around me.

297
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,380
What can I do?

298
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,380
How do you feel?

299
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,300
The Glaze Fruit works.

300
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
I feel better.

301
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,050
That's good.

302
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,660
Since you found your brother this time,

303
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,460
why didn't you

304
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,460
stay with him?

305
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,580
He already has Liu Shao.

306
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,900
I wanted to stay with you.

307
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,380
Good.

308
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,860
Then

309
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,940
I'll show you around.

310
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,740
I've seen the place where you grew up.

311
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,100
I also want to show you the place where I grew up.

312
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,460
Okay.

313
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,420
Come here.

314
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,460
I didn't think you'd come here.

315
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,860
I just want to see Luo Ge for something trivial.

316
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,300
I wonder how he's doing.

317
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,140
You came here yourself.

318
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,370
It's not something trivial, is it?

319
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,460
Can I know what's going on?

320
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,580
A few days ago, Ao Yin

321
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
escaped from the Immortal Palace.

322
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,380
Ao Yin?

323
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,540
Is he

324
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,460
the son of Ao Hen?

325
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,570
Now the Four Seasons Monument is unstable.

326
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,900
Ao Yin is killing people all over the mortal world.

327
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,340
This must be related to

328
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,860
the evil thing under the Four Seasons Monument.

329
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,460
Do you think

330
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,020
he's collecting spirit energy?

331
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,860
Yes.

332
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,220
He's collecting spirit energy

333
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,420
for elixir

334
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,300
to help the evil creature replenish its energy,

335
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,820
so that it can break the suppression of the Four Seasons Monument.

336
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,980
You can't deal with him?

337
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,740
If I were to do it alone,

338
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,700
it'd be hard to say who'd win.

339
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:51,940
So I'd like

340
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,620
to use Luo Ge's help.

341
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,540
Don't call Luo Ge.

342
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,980
Luo Ge is just a mortal now.

343
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,900
He cannot defend himself.

344
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,780
If we rashly interrupt his path of cultivation,

345
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,740
I'm afraid

346
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,180
he'll be possessed.

347
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,220
By then,

348
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,580
I'm afraid that all beings in the Three Realms

349
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,180
will be buried with him.

350
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,460
Where did she go

351
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,100
in such a short time?

352
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,340
Or

353
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,300
can I go help you?

354
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
My power of the sun

355
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
can restrain evil energy.

356
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,460
Yes, it does.

357
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,980
But it's a dangerous trip.

358
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,500
I know it's too risky.

359
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,220
It's just

360
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,700
I don't want to die in front of him.

361
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,700
What did you say?

362
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,300
I've already lost six talisman pearls.

363
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,020
To fight for three more days,

364
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,860
tomorrow,

365
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,410
I will give up the seventh.

366
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,940
The seventh one?

367
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,020
The last one?

368
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,140
No way!

369
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,900
Absolutely not!

370
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,980
Even if we don't deal with Ao Yin,

371
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,420
tomorrow

372
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,140
I'll lose the seventh one too.

373
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,340
In the end,

374
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,980
I want to do something for him.

375
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,050
Can you keep it a secret for me?

376
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,940
Please

377
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,580
do me a favor.

378
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,860
Did you go out for a walk?

379
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,860
Why didn't you ask me to join you?

380
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,220
Have some peanuts.

381
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,020
I've peeled them for you.

382
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,060
Is it good?

383
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,020
Yes.

384
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,780
Have some more.

385
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,340
I'm a little tired.

386
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,940
I want to take a break.

387
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,420
Okay.

388
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,450
Let me put it away.

389
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,580
You can eat it when you're done resting.

390
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,460
Luo Ge.

391
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,060
We're running out of time.

392
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,340
You should go back to Immortal Palace.

393
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,260
It's time for me to go too.

394
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:11,550
[Phoenix Tears]

395
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:15,900
Okay.

396
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,940
I've got a fence to tie after dinner.

397
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,700
You didn't make all these dishes, did you?

398
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,180
I had someone buy them from town.

399
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,740
I'm afraid it's getting a little cold.

400
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,380
Liu Shao.

401
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,260
You can tell me what you like.

402
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,740
I can learn to cook.

403
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,460
I've also asked someone to bring a pot of good liquor.

404
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,820
You should try it.

405
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,410
What's wrong?

406
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,980
You don't like it?

407
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,900
Liu Shao.

408
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,020
Do you remember what we said?

409
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,740
I'll let you hide behind me.

410
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,140
Actually,

411
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,140
I have seriously thought about

412
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,260
whether to be immortal again.

413
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,880
♫In the sea of clouds, I looked at the reflection of the moon in the water♫

414
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,620
In my opinion, identity is not important.

415
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,980
It doesn't matter whether I live in the Immortal Palace or the mortal world.

416
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,060
What really matters is

417
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,010
♫I kept waiting and arched my palms into a circle♫

418
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,700
that you are here

419
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,580
by my side.

420
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,860
♫The reflection gradually reminded me of our first meeting♫

421
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,740
♫I can no longer tell the difference between wind and rain♫

422
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,540
I don't care if I'm Luo Ge or Lu Li.

423
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,450
I'm only happy when you're here.

424
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,570
♫Even if I get the volley sword♫

425
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,980
That's the time to cherish.

426
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,600
♫I can't forget you♫

427

♫Our destiny has been sealed long ago♫

♫I have no other choice♫

429
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,420
Luo Ge.

430
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,850
♫Why have you been so far away from me every time♫

431
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,250
♫For billions of years♫

432
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,780

♫Who would like to take a broken willow branch and watch the moon alone in the blue sky♫

437
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,820
Give me a reason.

438
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:16,000
♫The remaining flowers in the mirror reflect the moon in the water♫

439
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,020
It's better for you

440
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,920
♫We can't live up to such a good time♫

441

442

♫Recalling the unforgettable glance at the beginning♫

443

♫I realized that it was a thousand years ago♫

444
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,580
♫Is this bad luck, or good luck?♫

445
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,820
I won't forget.

446
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,200
♫He said that responsibility and love are difficult to balance♫

447
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,780
You can't choose for me.

448
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,030
♫He had no choice but to leave me♫

449

Forgetting you

450
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,740
is the hardest thing for me.

♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

469
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,540
The great calamity is upon us.

470
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,780
It's already luxurious for us

471
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,300
to have six days of joy.

472
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,700
Luo Ge.

473
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,980
Forget about me.

474
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,660
Then you won't have to suffer the pain of the Soul-devouring Spell anymore.

475
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,220
Let's go.

476
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,260
This is the Mysterious Light Forest of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion?

477
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,140
That's right.

478
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,810
After you picked the Mysterious Light,

479
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,660
the mists cleared.

480
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,100
This forest is gradually abandoned.

481
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,540
Why do you have to see my hand?

482
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,260
The other one.

483
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,570
Be careful!

484
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,140
Ao Yin took it over

485
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,730
for the abundance of spiritual energy here.

486
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,860
Ao Hen had given Ao Yin much demon energy.

487
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,580
And he had the evil thing under the Four Seasons Monument to help him.

488
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,100
So he is now more powerful than his mother.

489
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,540
Liu Shao.

490
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,740
You…

491
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,540
Why do you want me to forget you?

492
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,500
It's better for you

493
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,220
to forget about me.

494
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,740
Why did you say this?

495
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,170
What's going on?

496
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,020
Liu Shao.

497
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,740
Wait.

498
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,860
There's danger here.

499
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,260
What's going on?

500
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,540
Luo Ge.

501
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:00,980
This is...

502
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,130
This is the Phoenix Tears.

503
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,820
What's going on?

504
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,940
Why did you take the Phoenix Tears?

505
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,780
Soul-devouring Curse?

506
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,340
I thought the Phoenix Tears

507
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,179
could make people forget love.

508
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,050
Why did it trigger the Soul-devouring Spell?

509
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,340
Forget love…

510
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,699
What is the Phoenix Tears?

511
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,780
It can make you forget

512
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,060
what and who you love.

513
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,739
I can't forget her.

514
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,100
Master.

515
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,139
Where's the antidote?

516
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,100
Give me the antidote!

517
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,659
There is no antidote for the Phoenix Tears and the Soul-devouring Curse.

518
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
How come the Soul-devouring Curse reacts so strongly?

519
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,340
No, I won't forget.

520
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,860
The Soul-devouring Curse can't make me.

521
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,699
Neither does the Phoenix Tears.

522
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,739
There's something weird about the Soul-devouring Curse.

523
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,940
Be careful!

524
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,100
He Na!

525
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
The Soul-devouring Spell

526
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,780
is coming out by itself.

527
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,940
I thought the most forbidden spell in the Three Realms

528
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,300
is insoluble.

529
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,700
Why did it leave the host by itself?

530
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,540
It's

531
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,940
hiding from something.

532
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,980
No way.

533
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,740
The Phoenix Tears is starting to work.

534
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,700
No!

535
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,060
No.

536
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,900
I can't forget her.

537
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,020
I can't forget.

538
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,820
Wait a minute.

539
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,700
There must be a reason

540
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,690
the spell flew out of my body.

541
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,010
If my guess is right,

542
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,580
Master,

543
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,180
no matter what I do next,

544
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,700
don't stop me.

545
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,020
Ao Yin has a natural advantage here.

546
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,300
Your power is limited away from the water.

547
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,780
You're no match for him.

548
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,500
Take my talisman pearl

549
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,660
and my divine spirit and go first.

550
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,700
I can't.

551
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,420
Let's go together.

552
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,540
Come back.

553
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,940
What are you doing?

554
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,020
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

555
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,540
I see.

556
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,730
We've been through

557
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,900
so much together.

558
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,700
I can't believe

559
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,700
the Soul-devouring Spell

560
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,180
is fearful of Phoenix Tears.

561
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,660
Soul-devouring Spell.

562
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,940
You made me suffer so much.

563
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,500
I never thought

564
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,220
you'd be so useful one day.

565
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,380
Don't leave!

566
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,540
Luo Ge, are you crazy?

567
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,060
If you go on like this,

568
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,980
the Soul-devouring Spell will kill you.

569
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,860
I won't forget her

570
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,980
even if I die.

571
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,540
Luo Ge.

572
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,460
Now that you're on my turf,

573
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,020
you won't leave alive.

574
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,380
Demon King in White,

575
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,260
it was you

576
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,340
who fought against my mother.

577
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,660
And you are the one the master is looking for.

578
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,060
Two good spirits.

579
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,020
Add them to the elixir.

580
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,140
The master will be very happy.

581
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,180
Liu Shao.

582
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:38,740
Liu Shao.

583
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,450
I was wondering who it is.

584
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
How can an immortal who's in love

585
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,340
call himself an immortal?

586
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,620
Does Supreme God need to

587
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,060
talk through a demon?

588
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,220
Don't you want to be yourself?

589
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,140
Why are you still clinging to doctrine?

590
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,740
Let me tell you what doctrine is.

591
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,820
It's about beloved ones and

592
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,980
peace for all beings in the Three Realms.

593
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,580
Since you can't let go of Liu Shao,

594
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,740
why do have to become immortal anyway?

595
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,700
The people of Immortal Palace are all self-righteous.

596
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,740
They talk about the immortals and the Three Realms.

597
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,260
It sounds noble.

598
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,340
But they're the same as me,

599
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,300
unable to let go of desire and love.

600
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,300
What a joke!

601
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,740
Why do you care?

602
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
Immortal.

603
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,380
Xiyin Mountain.

604
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,580
Xijin Mountain is stable.

605
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,820
Did Luo Ge…

606
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,100
That's right.

607
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,180
He did it.
