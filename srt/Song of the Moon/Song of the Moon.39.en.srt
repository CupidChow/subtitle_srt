It turns out that everything is already doomed.

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
My fate

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,800
has already been changed to the Three Realms

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240

17

a dramatic life

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,970
means such sacrifices.

20
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,720
The God of the Sun

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
must have felt the same way I do now.

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,720
He chose to use the Moon Sword,

23
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,680
in an attempt to save the Moonlight a ray of life.

24
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,170
So,

25
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,090
the God of Moonlight wanted me

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
to kill Luo Ge

Liu Shao.

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,040
It's a cruel choice.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,720
Should I leave you in the misery forever?

31
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,040
Maybe

32
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,960
it's the best

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,080
if I do it.

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
Immortal Liu Shao is back!

35
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,410
Tell her

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm in retreat.

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,760
I'll take care of the arrangements.

38

Oh.

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
What's wrong, Luo Ge?

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Care about your little bride?

41
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,280
Shut up!

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,800
Even the Moonlight can't kill me.

43
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
You think you can?

44
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,960
The God of Moonlight didn't kill you

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,680
because Sun's kindness.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,800
Liu Shao's gonna kill you this time.

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,680
It's a pity you don't have time.

Why are you still carrying it?

51
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,000
It's

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
a constant reminder of

53
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,010

54

You don't have to wear it.

58

But this time...

80
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,520
But this time to come to the Immortal Palace,

81
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,520
I still have some things in the demon world.

To refine this vine,

96
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,600
it must be in the demon world.

But...

120
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,720
The more you act like this,

the more I like you.

Of course you don't care.

Or

133
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,600
you want the Immortal Palace

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,840
and serve me well,

138
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,130
I'll let him come out to see you.

139
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm in a good mood today

140
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
and I suggest you play along.

141

I don't want to sacrifice their blood

what do you think?

145
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,080
Today

146
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,250
is my wedding day.

147
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,130
Don't just sit there.

148
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,760
Have a drink.

149
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,560
Pour my wine, please.

150
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
You pour the wine.

151
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,520
This is way out of line.

152
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,000
Are we just gonna sit here?

153
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,720
Let's just wait and see what happens.

154
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,440
Keep pouring.

155
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,720
Supreme God.

156
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,800
What is it?

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,400
I have one thing to report,

158
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,200
about the God of the Sun and Sun Spirit.

159
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,400
It's said that

160
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,450
the God of the Sun

161
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,360
has passed down some secrets

162
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,880
concerning you

163
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,250
by some secret method.

164
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,240
Secret?

165
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,210
I wonder

166
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,240
if you could walk to the Palace Chonghua for a chat.

167
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,690
I'd like to see

168
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,050
if you have any skeletons in your closet.

169
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,840
Liu Shao.

170
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,000
Wait for me.

171
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,530
If the God of the Sun had left behind

172
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,480
a secret way of dealing with this demon,

173
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,880
I should have seen it in the Crown Wheel.

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
Or...

175
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,610
This is what he meant

176
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,810
Luo Ge isn't gonna let this wedding happen?

177
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,530
Tell me.

178
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,690
What kind of secrets did the God of the Sun

179
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,680
tell you through secrecy?

180
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,930
Don't you wonder?

181
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,680
Ten thousand years ago,

182
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,770
Sun Spirit was clearly sealed by the God of the Sun,

183
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
but then

184
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
why did it wake up in Liu Shao's body?

185
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,930
The God of the Sun opened it in secret.

186
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,570
No.

187
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,970
I heard from Liu Shao that

188
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,320
it was the God of Moonlight.

189
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,040
Impossible.

190
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,650
Ten thousand years ago, the God of Moonlight...

191
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,130
Don't you dare plot against me?

192
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,010
He Na!

193
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,770
He Na.

He Na, please wake up.

the Water Hyacinth accessory

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,450
I'll wipe you out of this world,

348
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,770
without a trace.

349
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,400
It seems that if I don't give you this chance today,

350
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
you won't give up.

351
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,250
How about this?

352
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,800
Let's make a bet

353
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,720
that you can kill me.

354
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,330
Immortal Liu Shao.

355
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,210
Okay.

356
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,930
You can rest assured that

357
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,890
I will do it.

358
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,850
If you can't do it,

359
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,400
you'll have to be my wife

360
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,520
and serve me every day.

361
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,690
You can't think of anything else.

362
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,170
Do you dare to say yes?

363
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,850
Okay,

364
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,330
I agree.

365
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,090
Then I'll give you three days.

366
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,120
If you renege on that promise,

367
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,530
or break it later,

368
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,050
I'll make sure your family, friends,

369
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,440
and the Immortal Palace that Luo Ge cares about,

370
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,840
and even the whole Three Realms

371
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,690
die.

372
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,320
I won't stand you up.

373
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,530
In three days,

374
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,970
I will kill you

375
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,730
once and for all.

376
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,570
When my brother came back from the Immortal Palace,

377
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,890
he told me something.

378
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,320
Fu,

379
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,930
one day,

380
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,410
if anything happens to me,

381
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,160
you must do your best

382
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,770
to protect Liu Shao

383
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,770
and help her ascend to the god

384
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,930
to seal the evil spirits.

385
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,450
He and Luo Ge

386
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,680
had already made all kinds of preparations and plans.

387
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,490
So He Na's death

388
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,810
was also part of their plan?

389
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,610
They died

390
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,440
just for

391
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,690
the chance of winning.

392
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,090
Liu Shao.

393
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,810
You are their silver lining.

394
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,450
Don't let them die in vain.

395
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,970
Don't let

396
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,970
the Three Realms,

397
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,610
people,

398
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,130
and friends they're trying to protect

399
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,800
perish in the evil spirits.

400
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,520
For today's plan,

401
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,770
you must refine the Clear Vine as soon as possible,

402
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,480
break through the seal of divine spirit

403
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,530
and ascend to the god,

404
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,480
so as to control that evil thing.

405
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:06,920
Girl,

406
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,890
I have helped you dredge the meridians with the needle.

407
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,210
It can help the Clear Vine

408
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,210
break the seal,

409
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,890
but it will also make your pain worse.

410
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,880
You have to suck it up.

411
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,800
There's nothing going on in there.

412
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,850
Is everything okay?

413
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,480
I'll go and take a look.

414
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,080
No need.

415
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,330
Let me in.

416
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,720
Let him in.

417
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,690
This

418
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,240
is the real Immortal Master Wanwu.

419
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,010
Supreme God Liu Shao.

420
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,360
It starts to get interesting.

421
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,760
The three-day wait was not in vain.

422
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,930
The thought of you living more three days

423
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,530
under the name of Luo Ge

424
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,680
makes me sick.

425
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,690
Fortunately,

426
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,970
it ends today.

427
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,130
Luo Ge.

428
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,720
Liu Shao.

429
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,370
Liu Shao.

430
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
I remember I told you.

431
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,490
If you were the God of the Sun,

432
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,210
what would you choose?

433
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,370
I don't want you to waver.

434
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,850
So you kept it from me,

435
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,090
hoping to make me think that

436
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,570
I was splitting

437
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,010
the heart of that evil thing,

438
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,250
not your heart.

439
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,560
Now I'm Luo Ge.

440
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,040
But after tonight, I'll be an evil thing.

441
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,210
I'll bring the Three Realms to an eternal night.

442
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,570
And I'll bring death

443
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,960
to all the people of the world.

444
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,640
Liu Shao.

445
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,610
You know me

446
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,640
and you love me.

447
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,690
You should know that I would rather die

448
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,610
than put myself in that situation.

449
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,080
That evil thing

450
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,930
killed He Na?

451
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,570
Yes.

452
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,090
If you can't do it,

453
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,720
it will kill everyone in the Immortal Palace.

454
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,090
So you've been sober

455
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,200
since He Na died?

456
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,360
You soberly urged me to be the Supreme God,

457
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,650
so that

458
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,810
I could kill you

459
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,650
and seal that evil thing?

460
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,290
I'm sorry.

461
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,210
Only you

462
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,850
can do it.

463
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,850
Did He Na know?

464
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,770
He Na's death

465
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,130
and everything that happened after that

466
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,730
was a plot between He Na and me.

467
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,810
He Na.

468
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,010
Soon,

469
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,410
the Luo Ge you see again

470
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,600
may not be the real Luo Ge.

471
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,010
We all have someone to protect,

472
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,440
my people and the demon world,

473
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,450
your immortal palace and the Three Realms.

474
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,200
My days are numbered.

475
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,210
But even if I were to die,

476
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,930
I would not tolerate that evil thing

477
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,090
trampling on those I care about.

478
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,210
I can die,

479
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,570
but I will not tolerate

480
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,570
that evil thing in my name

481
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,450
to trample on all that I hold dear.

482
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,690
If we put our lives together,

483
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,690
what chance do we have of winning?

484
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,570
We don't even have a chance.

485
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,440
What?

486
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,450
But if Liu Shao can train herself to be the Supreme God,

487
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,280
she can kill me

488
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,330
and she will be able to pass on the seal of the Sun,

489
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,730
and seal the evil spirits in the Four Seasons Monument.

490
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,330
That way,

491
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,489
the Three Realms and everything we want to protect

492
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,409
and those we value

493
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,400
will be preserved.

494
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,610
Even if Liu Shao were the Supreme God,

495
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,330
she would be no match for that evil spirit.

496
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,090
Besides,

497
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,130
the evil spirit is in your heart.

498
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,880
To cut off the evil spirit

499
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,199
is to cut off your own vitality.

500
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,770
Liu Shao wouldn't have the guts to kill you.

501
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,690
What if

502
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,449
I pretend to be the Black Moonlight

503
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,400
and let her kill me?

504
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,560
She's too smart

505
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,970
to be fooled that easily.

506
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,760
Unless

507
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,930
the real Black Moonlight appears

508
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,850
and kills her most valued friend.

509
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,570
On the night before the wedding,

510
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,730
I could hardly control my evil spirit.

511
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,410
I sealed myself here

512
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,770
to preserve my power.

513
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,690
But I don't know

514
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,210
what happened after that.

515
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,440
He Na had a deal with me.

516
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,490
He said

517
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,930
he would deal with that evil thing.

518
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,570
If he dies,

519
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,330
he will pass his water power to me.

520
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,210
His water energy has the power to clear the mind,

521
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,880
which can make me temporarily awake.

522
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,290
But it will only last three days at most.

523
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,660
He Na gave his life

524
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,190
to help me get the three days,

525
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,350
so that you could have a chance to become a Supreme God

526
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,640
to seal the evil spirit.

527
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,490
Why?

528
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,970
Why sacrifice the two of you?

529
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,690
Did it ever occur to you that

530
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,530
whether this scheme succeeds or fails,

531
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,490
you will both die.

532
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,200
Our lives are nothing

533
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,170
compared to the peace and security of the Three Realms and the people.

534
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,250
Liu Shao.

535
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,170
I trust you.

536
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,970
You won't fail me and He Na,

537
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,480
right?

538
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,170
You don't have to provoke me.

539
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,600
I don't blame you

540
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,650
for keeping this decision from me.

541
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,370
Because I didn't intend to ask your permission

542
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,690
for what I'm about to do.

543
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,680
Liu Shao.

544
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,410
If you die,

545
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,130
that evil thing will not necessarily die.

546
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,010
It may break through the seal.

547
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,810
But when I die,

548
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,050
it dies

549
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,130
with me.

550
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,970
Luo Ge.

551
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,450
I remember when you were Lu Li,

552

♫On rainy days, wind blows smoke♫

553
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,410

♫On both sides, I'm chanting♫

557

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,020
♫The night is sleepless♫

♫The shadows of the moon are incomplete, and people are in love♫

♫Back to the sky, the clouds passing by♫

568

♫Is like the things we went through♫

570
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,370

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,370
you'll die.

♫The moment we passed each other♫

575

But Luo Ge

578
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,330
will live.

579

♫I look at my love and send it to the clouds outside the garden♫

♫You put the winter snow in your ears and can’t hear it♫

Liu Shao.

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,650
You are not Sun's shadow.

587
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:49,640
♫When the flowers stop falling, you and I will miss each other♫

♫Clouds billow up and fade away in the four seas♫

598

Sun killed what he loved.

♫The mountains and rivers after the farewell♫

Don't blame me, okay?

608
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,000
After all,

609
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,310
to live alone

610
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,380
is far crueler than

611
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,240
to die ignorant.

612
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,900

fly the wishing lantern with me again?

629

Liu Shao.

630
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
Do you remember what you wished for?

631
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,740
May day and night...

632

Be now.

633
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,310

638
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,990
I

639
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,120
agree.

640
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,370
In fact,

641
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,350
we've made it.

642
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,900
Look.

643
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,620
We're together now.

644
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,230
It's just that...

645
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,000
my life...

646
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,770
is a little short.

647
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,370
Immortal Luo Ge

648
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,250
kept the oath that day?

649
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,940
How about

650
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,250
Supreme God Luo Ge

651

Okay.

653
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,770
I make a wish.

654
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,960
May we be together

655
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,300
forever.

656
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,070
May we never part

657
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,670
day and night.

658
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,410
Agree.

Liu Shao.

660
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,720
Since you agreed,

661
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,240
I believe it.

662
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,780
I'll wait for you forever.

663
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,670
I'll wait for you day and night.

664
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,940
You can't go back on your word.

665
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,920
Don't keep me waiting too long.

666
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,930
Okay?

667
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,170
So...

668
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,940
Supreme God Luo Ge left the Immortal Palace?

669
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,900
Yes.

670
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,630
After he cured Master Zhuo,

671
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,010
he just left

672
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,440
and never went back.

673
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,910
Why didn't he go back?

674
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,960
I heard

00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,660
♫This is a spring song♫

676
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,950
he was looking for a bird with three feet.

677
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,310
It's the Three-legged Golden Crow,

♫The peach blossoms fly with the swallow♫

♫Whose lights are light and shine people's way home?♫

But somehow

684
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,990
Supreme God Luo Ge couldn't seem to see it

685
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:55,900

I will recognize you

690
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,190
♫I am waiting for you to say♫

691
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,490
and follow you

692
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,070
forever.

693
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:08,210
♫Tonight in this life♫

694
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:06,840
You can't run away.

695
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,020
♫Ask the flowing water whether it knows the red leaves♫

696
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,040
I won't run away.

697
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,030
I'll never run away.

698
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,600
♫I miss you so much♫

699
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,950
You must follow me forever.

700
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,070
♫I still remember the youth♫

701
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,810
I won't lose you.

702
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,180
♫I laughed and hated getting old♫

703
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,780
♫Flowers bloom alone. The fragrance fills the path♫

704
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,710
♫Look at the stars from faraway♫

705
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,390
♫The chaos of knowing love♫

706
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,200
♫The South Wind folds a little red♫

707
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,680
♫Send you to the Western State♫

708
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,580
♫Wild geese pass the mountains and the sea♫

709
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,870
♫I am rushing to a dream♫

710
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,110
♫The fate of three lifetimes♫

711
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,130
♫Appreciate with our hands tied♫

712
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:52,990
♫Thousands of paths with flowers♫

713
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,130
♫Flowers bloom alone. The fragrance fills the path♫
