4
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,289
I'm here!

5
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,740
Don't run.

6
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,490
♫How many rain seasons and rains do I need to see♫

7
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,540
If I wake up,

8
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,080
♫Before meeting you♫

9
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,980
I'm not gonna see you again.

10
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,020
No.

11
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,850
♫I am destined to sink to the bottom of the sea♫

12
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,020
Because...

13
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,780
♫You come to my mind♫

14
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,940
Is Luo Ge you, too?

15
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,180
Lu Li is me.

16
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,010
♫But this moment, you believe♫

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,579
Luo Ge is me, too.

18
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,030
♫You are my only one. Don't hesitate♫

19
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,380
Wherever you are,

20
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,140
I'll be there.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,990
♫Flowers fly after the rain♫

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,360
♫I stay there♫

23
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,380
This is the Lu Li on earth.

24
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,570
♫I say I miss you. Because of your name♫

25
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,290
♫The rest of my life is all about you♫

26
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,360
♫I can't tell if it is dream♫

27
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,850
♫After the flower blossoms, let the love go on♫

28
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,910
♫I say I miss you. Don't doubt it♫

29
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,770
♫You exist in my life♫

30
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,090
♫I want to stay with you♫

31
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,780
♫After the spring and the winter, let the love go on♫

32
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,660
So when I went through my ordeal on earth,

33
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,700
the person I met was you.

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,020
You admitted that

35
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,740
you're Lu Li?

36
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,420
You just...

37
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,860
forgot, right?

38
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,060
I don't need to remember.

39
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,420
Whatever I have experienced on earth, people or things,

40
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,500
or false love,

41
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,180
are just doom and gloom.

42
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,900
Since it's doom,

43
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,180
there's no need to look back.

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,300
I don't believe it.

45
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,140
You don't believe it?

46
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,460
Even if Lu Li did die,

47
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,380
even if his death

48
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,860
was so painful that it made the heart bleed,

49
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,140
I would like to look back on

50
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
my experience with him a million times.

51
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,140
Without these experiences,

52
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,700
my life

53
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,340
would have been pale and boring.

54
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,260
And the best thing

55
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,490
that ever happened to me

56
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,300
was that I met him.

57
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,780
Mortals are ridiculously fragile.

58
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,210
It's because of this obsession

59
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,170
that you're trapped in your dreams by Luo Ning's scent.

60
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,300
But I'm so happy now.

61
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,220
Because...

62
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,900
you're still alive.

63
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,700
All right.

64
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,180
I'm not him.

65
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,380
I advise you to go with the flow,

66
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
and stay away from love, hate, delusion and anger.

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,900
Don't waste yourself on me.

68
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,740
People can't stay away from love, hate, delusion and anger.

69
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,260
What's so good about being a clay fairy without a heart?

70
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,380
You're

71
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,380
quite special.

72
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,580
Come to Palace Chonghua

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,060
in four hours.

74
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,700
Bai Feng, don't worry.

75
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,900
Within three days,

76
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,420
your internal wounds will be healed.

77
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,659
But

78
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,700
we just became friends.

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,900
You're leaving again.

80
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,770
Liu Shao said

81
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,220
Lu Li might still be alive.

82
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,460
I can't just go back to earth.

83
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
If you come next time,

84
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,220
we'll get together again.

85
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,940
Okay.

86
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,890
Thank you.

87
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,320
Master.

88
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,940
Who is that?

89
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,900
He seems to be popular with his disciples.

90
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,300
-That's Immortal Luo Ge's master. -You have a good talent.

91
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,920
-Immortal Master Wanwu. -Practice with your heart.

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,700
There's a good chance that Immortal Luo Ge will become a god.

93
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,460
Then Immortal Master Wanwu's position

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,890
would be very different.

95
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,020
Very different?

96
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,180
Become a god?

97
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,820
General Xie.

98
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,340
Well,

99
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,100
he has

100
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,580
a human face.

101
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,290
I can't believe he broke

102
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,420
a thousand years of rules.

103
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,780
That's ridiculous.

104
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,850
He's the only upper immortal in the Three Realms.

105
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,420
If it hadn't been for the Immortal Palace's compassion,

106
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,090
you wouldn't have stayed to heal.

107
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,300
You're just a mortal.

108
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,700
Don't you dare say that

109
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,420
in Immortal Palace.

110
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,650
Is it reasonable

111
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,860
for you to discredit the Immortal?

112
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,220
-Immortal Master Wanwu. -Immortal Master Wanwu.

113
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,220
How dare you

114
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
stand up to General Xie.

115
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,820
Aren't you afraid of death?

116
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,700
All I know is that

117
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,980
the Immortal was born for the Three Realms

118
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,860
and can't be discredited.

119
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,330
Beyond this,

120
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,460
I'm not afraid of anything.

121
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,140
You!

122
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,860
I like

123
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,210
her very much.

124
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,620
She can stay.

125
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,780
But,

126
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,060
you're going to start with my court chores.

127
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,300
Will you?

128
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,180
I will do anything.

129
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,059
I'm finally here.

130
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,620
Oh, no.

131
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,260
To enter the Palace Chonghua,

132
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,820
I have to break a formation?

133
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,060
Formation?

134
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,980
Ge.

135
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,660
What were you thinking?

136
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,060
Since we want to leave her in the Xiyin Mountain,

137
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,890
we must test her patience and understanding.

138
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,260
All we need

139
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,820
is her blood.

140
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,460
Restoring the Four Seasons Monument

141
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,180
and protecting the peace of the Three Realms

142
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,420
are the real compassion for all living beings.

143
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,170
But Liu Shao is one of them.

144
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,850
We should never give up

145
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,140
unless we have to.

146
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,900
Besides, even if we use up Liu Shao's blood,

147
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,730
we may not be able to restore the Four Seasons Monument.

148
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,460
But if she has the skill to break the formation,

149
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,060
I have a plan,

150
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,900
making a blood amulet.

151
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,450
Blood amulet?

152
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,780
Okay.

153
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,450
Okay.

154
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,620
Lu Li.

155
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,140
You still have 15 minutes.

156
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,540
You!

157
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,180
Ouch!

158
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,620
Who...who...who?

159
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,100
Who...who...who?

160
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,300
Who dares to beard the lion in his den?

161
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,980
Gosh,

162
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,180
Liu Shao!

163
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,300
Master!

164
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,650
What are you doing here?

165
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,500
I...

166
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,490
So many things have happened.

167
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,340
The Four Seasons Monument changed because of you?

168
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,820
The new Immortal

169
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,860
is Lu Li?

170
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,300
I think he's Lu Li.

171
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,140
But...

172
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,900
He's not like Lu Li.

173
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,540
Lu Li wouldn't do it to me,

174
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,060
and he wouldn't do it to anyone else.

175
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,660
So he went to earth to experience hardships?

176
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,980
Now he has no earthly memory.

177
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
He didn't know you,

178
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,220
so he gave you the cold shoulder.

179
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,220
But it's old wine in a new bottle.

180
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,780
The flowers and leaves are replaced but the roots remain the same.

181
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,860
Isn't he the same guy?

182
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,740
Girl.

183
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,900
Lu Li

184
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,860
is the one who holds you close to his heart.

185
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,420
It's not something you can give up if you want to.

186
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,050
Even if he wants to,

187
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,580
I won't let him give up.

188
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,900
Isn't Lu Li him?

189
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,620
Anyway.

190
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,980
What we said before

191
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,100
doesn't count?

192
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,700
I will definitely make him like me again,

193
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,660
at least he can remember me again.

194
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,420
That's the Liu Shao I know.

195
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,690
Palace Chonghua is close at hand.

196
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,700
I don't believe I can't get through.

197
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,700
That's right.

198
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,060
The mutated Five-Element Formation

199
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,500
is also a Five-Element Formation.

200
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,340
Yes.

201
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,420
I'm sure

202
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,620
you can break this formation.

203
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,330
Remember,

204
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,740
Lu Li's formation was taught by Lu Sheng.

205
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,060
I've only learned a little,

206
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,460
but,

207
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,860
it's enough.

208
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,450
Five pillars are based on wood.

209
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,780
Therefore,

210
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,580
this five elements formation is centered on wood.

211
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,220
I used fire to restrain gold,

212
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,660
but it was restrained by water.

213
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,980
I can

214
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,450
use wood to release water

215
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,060
to make a fire.

216
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,580
In the end,

217
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,180
I used wood as a constraint.

218
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,620
Earth grew with gold.

219
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,410
Water and earth are disconnected.

220
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,620
The fire can fetch gold directly.

221
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,580
How is this formation gonna stop me?

222
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,860
Let's go.

223
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,940
I came here on time.

224
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,700
Immortal!

225
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,660
Is it okay to do this?

226
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,140
Yes.

227
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,180
Immortal!

228
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
I came here on time.

229
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,460
We're coming in.

230
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,540
Why is there no one here?

231
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,340
Immortal!

232
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,340
Immortal, are you there?

233
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,770
I think

234
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,820
he's hiding

235
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,140
because he saw you fall and didn't picked you up.

236
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,020
You think too much.

237
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,460
Girl.

238
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,460
What is it?

239
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,300
Why does this tree grow upside down?

240
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,860
Where is its roots?

241
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,620
How much better can a tree be when it's off the ground?

242
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,890
It's all alone.

243
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:12,980
Girl,

244
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,570
do me a favor.

245
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,660
Water this dude.

246
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,500
This is Immortal's palace.

247
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,300
I dare not.

248
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,300
Take it back.

249
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,860
If you take good care of the tree,

250
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,020
he won't blame you.

251
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,140
Listen to me. It can't be wrong.

252
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,340
Really?

253
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,220
Okay.

254
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,380
Im... Im...Immortal.

255
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,020
We... we have no other intention.

256
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,460
We just want to water the tree.

257
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,860
This is Xuan Ling Wood.

258
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,260
It's nourished by the immortal power.

259
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,220
It doesn't need rain and dew.

260
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,380
Of course,

261
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,540
it doesn't need your watering.

262
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,530
You're the new gardener

263
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,340
of the Xiyin Mountain?

264
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,020
You really are Lu Li.

265
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,580
The willows of Xiyin Mountain have been dead for a hundred years.

266
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,740
But because of you,

267
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,220
they came back to life.

268
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,100
Thank you.

269
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,220
You're welcome.

270
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,580
Planting trees and flowers

271
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,580
is my favorite.

272
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,660
Please take care of

273
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,500
the flowers and trees of the Xiyin Mountain.

274
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,940
No problem.

275
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,900
Would you please leave?

276
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,020
I have something to say to Liu Shao.

277
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,460
Go, go, go.

278
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,340
Go.

279
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,540
Immortal,

280
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,180
what do you want me to do here?

281
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,180
You have Sun's power.

282
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,140
The blood in you can repair the Four Seasons Monument.

283
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,940
You know that, right?

284
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,540
I didn't know this before.

285
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,940
Now I know.

286
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,940
So?

287
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,540
Are you going to drain my blood

288
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,300
to repair the Four Seasons Monument?

289
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,740
Even if I drained your blood,

290
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,060
it may not be enough to repair it.

291
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,860
So?

292
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,530
I'm going to plant a blood amulet on you,

293
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,420
using your blood and energy

294
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,180
to make the talisman pearl.

295
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,450
And then I'll take out the talisman pearl

296
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,930
to repair the Four Seasons Monument.

297
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,579
Would that have any effect on my body?

298
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,660
It doesn't matter to take one or two out.

299
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,579
If you take out four or five, you're going to be very weak.

300
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,020
If we take seven out,

301
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,460
the restoration of Four Seasons Monument will be assured.

302
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,500
But you...

303
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,780
will die.

304
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,569
Well...

305
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,540
How many do you need?

306
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,940
Well.

307
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,620
I can't decide until I see how effective the talisman pearls are.

308
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,580
If it doesn't work,

309
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,020
you'd really take seven out

310
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,580
and kill me?

311
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,140
You can disagree.

312
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,860
But if the Four Seasons Monument is ever in danger,

313
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,570
you'll be sacrificed for blood.

314
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,340
And you'll have no chance of survival.

315
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,340
This is

316
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,020
your compassion?

317
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,620
I pity all beings, but you are only one of them.

318
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,740
If you are lucky enough,

319
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,420
one day you'll get the talisman pearls back.

320
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,020
And you'll be as good as ever.

321
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,940
It seems I have to say yes.

322
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,860
Then promise me one thing.

323
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,020
What is it?

324
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,420
Your palace

325
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,780
won't stop me.

326
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,130
I can come and go as I please.

327
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,020
I know you like to be quiet.

328
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,540
But if you want to make me into talisman pearls,

329
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,900
I'm afraid my days here are numbered.

330
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,300
Okay.

331
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,780
I promise you.

332
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,420
But you must abide by

333
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,780
my rules.

334
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,260
Please go ahead.

335
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,900
There are three things you can't do.

336
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,780
First,

337
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,300
Xuan Ling Wood can't be touched.

338
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:12,820
Second,

339
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,700
the books in the palace can't be touched.

340
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,570
Third,

341
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,100
and

342
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,180
most important,

343
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,460
I

344
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,060
can't be touched,

345
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,780
even a shadow or a piece of clothing.

346
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,580
Do you understand?

347
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,780
I will follow your rules.

348
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,420
But please promise me one condition.

349
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,100
Go ahead.

350
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,340
Don't blame Luo Ning for the scent in my dream.

351
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,380
It's all my obsession.

352
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,060
She just wanted to help me.

353
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,940
That's all?

354
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,210
Okay.

355
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,580
So many scriptures!

356
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
Copy them all?

357
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,100
My brother

358
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,060
told you to bring them to me?

359
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,340
Yes.

360
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,020
He also said this time was different.

361
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,660
You can't copy this book

362
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,740
until you've made the words disappear.

363
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,660
How... How can I

364
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,020
copy out the words from the scripture?

365
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,620
Don't you know how to do magic?

366
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,820
You can cast spells.

367
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,980
Right.

368
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,060
How could I forget?

369
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,620
Okay.

370
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,260
Well.

371
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,140
Let me think.

372
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,900
Try... Try again.

373
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,020
Okay.

374
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,100
It didn't work?

375
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,860
Did Luo Ge ban these books?

376
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,020
Why can't this work?

377
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,940
Or Luo Ning's magic didn't work?

378
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Liu Shao.

379
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,300
How about...

380
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,620
How about you go back and talk to my brother?

381
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,420
Let him think of something else.

382
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,050
He won't listen to me.

383
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,860
But, I can help you with something.

384
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,780
Have you seen all these before?

385
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,780
Yes,

386
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,940
and I've copied them many times.

387
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,020
But...

388
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,060
But what good is that?

389
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,220
I'm not interested in them at all.

390
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,420
And I soon forget the content.

391
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,690
Love brings sorrow.

392
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,500
The word is gone.

393
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,180
Yes!

394
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,060
I get it.

395
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,300
Only when the words are really in your heart

396
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,660
will they disappear.

397
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,940
I see.

398
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,500
Liu Shao.

399
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,820
I think

400
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,100
this all seems

401
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,180
pretty easy to you.

402
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
How about this?

403
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,620
Do me a favor.

404
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,500
I need you to recite all this for me.

405
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,450
So I can talk to my brother.

406
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,380
Okay? Liu Wei.

407
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,260
Luo Ning.

408

the dew of the King Herb?

410
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,780
The dew of the King Herb?

411
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,260
Yes! Yes!

412
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,740
Tell me where it is.

413
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,540
Okay, but...

414
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,500
You have to memorize it first.

415
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,930
Don't worry.

416
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,980
I'll do it with you.

417
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,170
You... you're done?

[Meditation Spell]

419
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,300
Why did Senior Zhuo come to Xiyin Mountain again?

420
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,940
Master Shang

421
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,340
must have sneaked out again.

422
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,700
Master Shang?

423
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,420
Yes.

424
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,450
Let me tell you.

425
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,260
The master of three palaces, Shang Yurong,

426
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,540
is flashy

427
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,980
and at loose ends all day.

428
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,780
So,

429
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,100
you have to be careful

430
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,580
and stay away from him.

431
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,060
Okay.

432

[Palace of Abyssal Mirrors]

433
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,380
Let's hurry up.

434
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,180
We'll be waiting at the Litian Temple later.

435
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,140
The canonization of the Immortal is about to begin.

436
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,220
Okay, I get it.

437
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,660
Shang Yurong!

438
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,940
Get out here!

439
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,980
General Zhuo.

440
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,860
Where is Master Shang?

441
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,810
He went out early in the morning.

442
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,500
Did he not know that

443
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,460
the canonization ceremony was to take place this morning?

444
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,940
He's the head of three palaces.

445
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,100
He has to be there.

446
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,940
Yes...yes.

447
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,540
Then why is he hiding?

448
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:34,900
Go.

449
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,540
Bring me

450

his favorite dress inlaid with gold silk

451
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,420
and the sea pearl crown.

General Zhuo.

453
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,140
Tell your master

454
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,380
he must be at the Litian Temple

455
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,940
when the auspicious time comes.

456
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,180
Otherwise,

457
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,620
I'm sure

458
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,140
he won't be able to wear a single piece of yarn.

459

461
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,860
You're so nice.

462
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,500
I've finally finished memorizing these books.

463
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,140
Thank you.

464
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,500
But if it hadn't been for me,

465
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,180
you wouldn't have been punished by the Immortal.

466
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,340
So it's all about sharing the good

467
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,340
and the bad.

468
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,090
Let's look for the dew.

469
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,580
Let's go.

470
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,500
Wait.

471
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,810
Liu Shao.

472
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,860
I don't want to look for the dew now.

473
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,380
Why don't we go to the Litian Temple together?

474
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,620
Today

475
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,340
is the day of my brother's canonization.

476
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,300
Let's go together.

477
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,860
Luo Ge will be promoted to the Immortal?

478
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,100
Let's go together, okay?

479
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,420
So Lu Li will be the Immortal?

480
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,430
There hasn't been an immortal in thousands of years.

481
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,620
Why isn't Rong here yet?

482
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,020
It's a blessing for the Immortal Palace.

483
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,660
I'm looking forward to it.

484
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,190
Yes.

485
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,700
There's only one immortal in a thousand years,

486
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,380
so the ceremony has to be huge.

487
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,410
The Immortal is about to be canonized.

488
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,660
On such an important day,

489
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,140
as the head of three palaces,

490
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,500
I can't believe Shang Yurong didn't show up.

491
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,260
That would be pretty humiliating for the Immortal.

492
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
Master Shang has been so busy practicing recently

493
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,180
that he can't help losing track of time.

494
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,700
The Immortal is coming,

495
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,700
but Master Shang isn't here.

496
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,450
Who will be in charge?

497
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,660
He's right.

498
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,690
Now Luo Ge is the Immortal.

499
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Can Shang Yurong

500
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,580
still sit at the top?

501
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

502
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,180
Can't you see that?

503
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,580
Shang Yurong

504
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,700
is no match for

505
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,660
the Immortal.

506
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,300
If it hadn't been for former Master Shang's favoritism,

507
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,940
I'm afraid he wouldn't have been able to maintain

508
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,380
his position as the master of the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors.

509
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,580
Now Shang Yurong is the head of the three palaces,

510
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,500
but he hasn't even learned

511
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,340
the Burning Sea of the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors.

512
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,620
How does this reassure

513
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:16,900
the dead master?

514
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,220
I advise you to tread lightly.

515
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
To criticize the master of the palace

516
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,940
is to violate the immortal rules.

517
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,460
You overreacted.

518
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,700
I don't think I'm breaking the rules

519
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,900
by telling the truth.

520
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,420
I'm just

521
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,980
happy for Luo Ge

522
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,940
because he got promoted.

523
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,300
What are you trying to say?

524
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,540
Everyone,

525
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,420
with Luo Ge's ascension to the Immortal,

526
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,020
I think the whole Immortal Palace needs to change.

527
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,980
For example,

528
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,500
the position of the head of the three palaces

529
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,140
should be replaced by a competent man.

530
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,460
I won't argue with you

531
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,980
on this day of the Immortal's canonization.

532
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,580
If you don't stop talking like that,

533
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,980
I'll take it out on you.

534
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,740
Oh,

535
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,140
I was right?

536
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,580
You don't want to change the master?

537
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,980
Is that true?

538
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,170
Yes.

539
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,100
The Immortal really should have chosen someone else to be the master.

540
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,060
Otherwise, the Immortal Palace's foundation

541
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,340
would be ruined.

542
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,900
The throne of the three palaces is not for you to judge.

543
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,010
Ridiculous!

544
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,780
Then I would like to ask you

545
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,660
where is

546
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,900
Abyssal Mirrors Palace's

547
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,980
noble master?

548
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,370
[Shang Yurong, Master of the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors]

549
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,460
Go!

550
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,100
Luo Ning.

551
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,700
Looks like she took too long to recite last night.

552
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,700
But this...

553
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,500
What am I supposed to do?

554
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,020
Who are you?

555
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,740
Miss, are you going to the Litian Temple in the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors?

556
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,420
Yes.

557
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,300
I know the way.

558
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,260
I'll take you there.

559
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,780
But I don't even know who you are.

560
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,140
What does that matter?

561
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,460
This is the Immortal Palace,

562
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,260
the most peaceful and boring place in the world.

563
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,050
And I'm so well-dressed.

564
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,180
I'm not a bad person, okay?

565
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,060
All right.

566
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,620
Thank you.

567
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,220
By the way,

568
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,700
you don't seem to know how to sail.

569
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,620
Let me teach you.

570
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:46,700
Okay.

571
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,380
That will do.

572
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,050
Yes, that's it. Not bad.

573
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,210
You go a little further to the left.

574
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,020
A little more to the left.

575
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,340
A little more to the left.

576
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,660
No, no, no.

577
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,380
To the right.

578
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,780
Okay.

579
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,860
Yes, yes, yes.

580
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,500
That's it.

581
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,700
Yes, yes.

582
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,460
To the left.

583
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,460
Left.

584
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,380
You!

585
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,460
Shang Yurong!

586
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,930
Don't you dare tell us what to do.

587
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,940
I'll go to the Palace Wuxie

588
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,980
and tell your Senior Zhuo.

589
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,500
Ning, you woke up just in time.

590
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,540
Here, look at me.

591
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,340
Is such a beautiful scene

592
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,620
a perfect match

593
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,170
for my gorgeous golden feather garment?

594
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,980
So,

595
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,820
you kept telling me to adjust the angle

596
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,100
to suit

597
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,220
your outfit?

598
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,500
Yes.

599
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,340
What?

600
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,460
You've gone too far.

601
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,900
I'm gonna go back and tell my brother.

602
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,340
The Palace of Abyssal Mirrors is the head of the three immortal palaces.

603
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,179
And I'm the master.

604
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,219
I'm not afraid of your brother.

605
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,020
Liu Shao.

606
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,690
What you don't know is that

607
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,860
this guy

608
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,179
has been practicing the Burning Sea for 500 years

609
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,170
without success,

610
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,739
which got his Senior Zhuo

611
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,219
ridiculed by Xie Lingqi.

612
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,500
Don't you dare compare yourself to my brother.

613
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,139
What? Xie Lingqi?

614
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,380
He dared to laugh at my senior sister?

615
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,449
I wonder if the ceremony is about to begin?

616
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,460
Will we be late?

617
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,900
No, no.

618
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,179
Ignore him.

619
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,260
Have a seat.

620
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,739
Master Shang is too busy practicing

621
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,940
to come here.

622
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,340
On behalf of the master, I'd like to propose a toast to you.

623
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,380
May God bless the Abyssal Mirror.

624
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,980
Who said Master Shang wasn't coming?

625
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,820
Immortal Master.

626
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,540
Master Shang told me that

627
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,020
since three palaces wanted to congratulate the Immortal,

628
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,180
the gift

629
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,020
should be shared by three palaces.

630
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,700
Sister Zhuo, please open this box first.

631
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,580
Why is she here?

632
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,260
It's inappropriate, isn't it?

633
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,820
I can't believe she showed up at this big event.

634
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,100
General Xie.

635
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,220
Please read out the words on the scroll

636
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,900
so that the ceremony is complete.

637
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,540
Why me?

638
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,580
It's Master Shang's request.

639
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,300
Well,

640
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,500
can't you read?

641
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,740
I...

642
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,620
Immortal

643
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,020
Shang

644
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,180
Yu

645
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,740
Rong

646
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,340
arrives.

647
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,580
I, Shang Yurong, the head of three palaces,

648
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,260
led the Immortal Palace

649
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,420
to greet Immortal.

650
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,020
Immortal.

651
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,660
I'm from Xiyin Mountain.

652
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,900
She's the one I need to protect.

653
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,260
Congratulations, Immortal.

654
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,570
Your body is glassy

655
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,940
inside and out.

656
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,660
You demonstrate your ideas by acting on them.

657
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,380
We are clean together.

658
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,780
Congratulations on your promotion.

659
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,020
From now on, your grace is all over the world.

660
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,620
The Three Realms are at ease.

661
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,140
I, Luo Ge,

662
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,220
wish to benefit the Three Realms

663
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,700
and the people.

664
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,060
I would like to be the way to all beings.

665
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,300
I would like to give all

666
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,060
in exchange for the clarity of the world.

667
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,890
Yes.

668
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,820
This is my senior.

669
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,340
She is in charge of Palace Wuji,

670
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,740
responsible for the rules and regulations.

671
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,660
The Thunder Whip in her hand is for evil creatures.

672
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,100
This is Immortal Wanwu, the Master of Palace Wuji,

673
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,620
responsible for the suppression of evil and expeditions.

674
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,180
As for

675
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,420
the other affairs of the Immortal Palace,

676
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,780
the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors is in charge.

677
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,380
So

678
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,370
the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors is the head of the three palaces?

679
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,210
Smart.

680
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,900
What about Palace Chonghua?

681
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,740
The three palaces do not include Palace Chonghua.

682
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,380
Luo Ge devoted himself to practice

683
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,500
and became an immortal.

684
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,700
Of course, Palace Chonghua

685
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,820
is more otherworldly.

686
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,220
Come here.

687
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,180
Get up, get up, get up.

688
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,380
Behind.

689
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,380
Have a seat.

690
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,300
Me? Can I?

691
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,380
Yes.

692
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,340
Sit down.

693
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,780
I don't think it's appropriate.

694
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,900
What's wrong with this?

695
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,220
I don't think that's appropriate.

696
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,340
This is the feast of the Immortal.

697
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,620
She's just a mortal.

698
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,890
What qualifies her to sit?

699
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,460
Sit down.

700
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,980
Well,

701
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,370
if Liu Shao wants,

702
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,260
she can be my wife.

703
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,210
Shang Yurong!

704
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,500
Do you know what you are saying?

705
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,260
There has to be a limit to willfulness.

706
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,540
Sit down.

707
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,260
I don't care

708
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,420
if she's mortal or immortal.

709
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,660
All I know is that

710
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,060
Liu Shao has promised to use herself to make the blood amulet

711
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,620
to repair the Four Seasons Monument.

712
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,820
I want to ask who in this room

713
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,890
can do that.

714
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,100
Tomorrow I'll lay out a magic circle on Lusitai

715
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,500
and use Liu Shao's body

716
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,850
for the blood amulet.

717
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,980
I'm willing to help you

718
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,140
defend the magic circle.

719
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,100
No need.

720
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,060
Disciples of the Three Immortal Palaces

721
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,500
are not allowed to go near Lusitai

722
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,500
for three days.

723
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,340
Yes.
