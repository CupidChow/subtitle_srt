Liu Shao.

00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,580
Lu Li.

6
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,780
Lu Li, where are you?

7
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,180
Lu Li?

8
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,020
Isn't this my home?

9
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,300
Why am I back?

10
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,579
It's you?

11
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,420
You changed my fate after I turned 18?

12
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,740
That's right.

13
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,020
It was me.

14
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,420
I met the great demon

15
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,100
and then hid in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

16
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,570
What an exciting life!

17
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,250
But

18
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,930
I still have to thank you

19
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,340
for letting me meet Lu Li.

20
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,660
Really?

21
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,460
You're not him anymore.

22
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,940
I am him.

23
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,810
If you don't believe me,

24
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,540
you can see for yourself.

25
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,060
One has compassion for the universe

26
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,780
while the other is a scourge to the three realms.

27
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,810
You are not him.

28
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,500
They are…

29
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,780
Lu Li.

30
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,780
Do you see?

31
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,380
It's me.

32
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
She's destined to kill you.

33
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,180
Liu Shao.

34
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,180
How could this happen?

35
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,580
Wait.

36
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,769
This is an illusion.

37
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,459
Lu Li?

38
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,570
This must be an illusion.

39
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,860
What's going on?

40
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,700
How could this happen?

41
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,820
That's right.

42
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,580
Are they in danger?

43
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,090
Liu Shao.

44
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,100
I trust you.

45
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,180
You…

46
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,100
Can you get away?

47
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,980
This is all an illusion.

48
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,180
I have to get out.

49
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,340
Brother.

50
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
Brother, how is it?

51
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,340

How is it?

53

How is it?

54
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,340
How are you feeling?

55
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,100
Are you all right?

56
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,620
Who was the one

57
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,140
who broke through the illusion

58
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,340
and completed the trial?

59
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,180
Was it me?

60
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,980
But I didn't do anything.

61
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,700
Lu Li, wasn't it you?

62
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,330
It wasn't me.

63
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,700
It was you.

64
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,180
From the Spirit Fire to King Herb,

65
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,740
and then to the Moon Sword,

66
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,620
it's been proven

67
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,420
that you're the right one to draw the sword.

68
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,380
In that case,

69
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,780
Liu Shao will draw the sword.

70
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,100
You will inherit the title of Marquis Wuyang.

-Lu Li. -That's impossible.

72
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,140
Lu Li is the current Marquis Wuyang?

73
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
My Lord, well...

74
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,380
He who knows others is smart.

75
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,940
He who knows himself is wise.

76
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,700
He who overcomes others is powerful.

77
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,620
He who disciples himself is invincible.

78
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,380
I trust you.

79
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,210
Thank you, my Lord.

80
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,810
I'll give you half of the King Herb.

81
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,180
But my Lord,

82
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,740
don't you need this to renew your life?

83
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,420
It's far better to renew the future of the world

84
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,620
than renew my life alone.

85
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,820
I'll accept the order.

86
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,490
I wish

87
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,300
the King Herb

88
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,380
can help Liu Shao

89
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,860
increase her spiritual power

90
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,059
to pull out the Moon Sword.

91
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,500
From then on, the human world

92
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,940
will only kneel to our parents,

93
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,340
no longer

94
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,380
held by other races.

95
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,340
I'll accept the order.

96
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,580
To pacify the demons and protect all beings!

97
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,260
My Lord.

98
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,940
The two disciples of Marquis Wuyang

99
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,930
have come out from the Moon Platform.

100
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,860
I heard the female disciple

101
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,940
passed the Moon Sword Trial.

102
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,170
That means

103
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,900
she might really be able to pull out the Moon Sword.

104
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,740
She's good, brother.

105
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,060
Tell me.

106
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,220
What's her name again?

107
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,220
Liu Shao?

108
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,300
It seems that the three worlds

109
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,900
will never be peaceful again.

110
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,940
There has never been peace

111
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,340
in the three worlds.

112
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,220
Its chaos

113
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,820
is not bad for us.

114
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,820

[Qiutian Pavilion]

116
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,380
I can't believe the immortal

117
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,210
looked like you.

118
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,060
That was an illusion created by the Moon Sword, right?

119
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
What you saw

120
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,700
was me.

121
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,460
Because I knew you were trapped in there too.

122
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,650
So I used our opposing power

123
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,020
to push you to your potential

124
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,140
and break through the illusion.

125
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,940
Weren't you afraid you'd strangle me to death?

126
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,370
I was.

127
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,340
Of course I was.

128
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,100
But I was more worried

129
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,740
we couldn't get through the spell

130
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,460
and die inside.

131
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,740
If you are still upset,

132
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,540
come on.

133
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,020
Pinch me.

134
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,020
Pinch you?

135
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,060
I don't want to.

136
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,420
I'm afraid to stain my hands.

137
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,740
If you dare to cheat me,

138
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,460
I'll pull out the Moon Sword

139
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,180
and stab you.

140
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,340
Lu Li.

141
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,900
Do you see?

142
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,610
She's destined to kill you.

143
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,460
Wait, I clearly saw

144
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
the Moon Sword devouring the God of the Sun.

145
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
Is there no problem

146
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,420
for Liu Shao to draw the sword?

147
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,140
Lu Li.

148
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,780
What are you thinking?

149
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,740
Nothing.

150
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,450
When are you going to draw the sword?

151
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,530
My Lord

152
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,460
let me refine the power of the King Herb tonight.

153
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,140
I'll go draw it tomorrow at noon

154
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,260
when the Qi of the Greatness is at its peak.

155
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,220
For your sake,

156
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,620
and my own sake,

157
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,620
I will pull out the Moon Sword.

158
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,140
Okay.

159
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,540
I have to go out of the mansion.

160
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,460
Wait for me to come back.

161
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,580
Remember.

162
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,660
Make sure you wait for me to come back before you draw the sword.

163
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,460
Do you understand?

164
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
It's such an important thing.

165
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,620
Of course I will wait for you.

166
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,130
What's wrong with Lu Li?

167
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,740
Why did the Moon Sword

168
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,500
let me see an immortal looking like Lu Li?

169
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,380
Master.

170
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,220
Liu Shao has passed the ultimate trial of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

171
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,180
I believe she can pull out the Moon Sword.

172
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,620
Very well.

173
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,700
I came back to ask you for advice.

174
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,620
Will it be dangerous

175
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,420
for Liu Shao to draw the sword?

176
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,060
Moon Sword is left behind by the gods.

177
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,700
How could it be dangerous?

178
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,770
Then do you know

179
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,260
what the ultimate trial of the Moon Sword is?

180
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,860
It's just a trial of a sword.

181
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,660
Without the master's control,

182
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,140
it's nothing more than

183
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,940
a false

184
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,700
and confusing illusion.

185
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,540
But the illusion

186
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,900
is just like a dream.

187
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,220
It comes either from one's own memory

188
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,980
or from the memory of the sword.

189
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
In my vision,

190
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,660
Liu Shao killed me with the Moon Sword.

191
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,860
But she suffered a backlash.

192
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,540
It's a sword from ten thousand years ago.

193
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,300
How could it have memories of you two?

194
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,900
So

195
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,460
in the illusion,

196
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,420
we thought they were us,

197
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,100
but it was an illusion created by the Moon Sword

198
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,980
with the memories of the two gods,

199
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,380
which was not entirely real?

200
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,130
But there is one thing that can't be wrong.

201
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,860
If even the God of the Sun

202
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,420
was once devoured by the Moon Sword,

203
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,700
what about Liu Shao?

204
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,490
Will Liu Shao be in danger?

205
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,980
As long as she doesn't use her vitality,

206
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,460
she'll be safe from the devouring.

207
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,460
Liu Shao wants to pull out the Moon Sword.

208
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,380
How can she not use her vitality?

209
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,380
Master, do you have any more…

210
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,180

211
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,700

Master! Master!

214
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
Master.

215
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,900
Ma…

216
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,540
Master, I only found this in his room.

217
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,620
Go on.

218
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,220
Yes.

219
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,740
If only one of you can live,

220
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,500
I will choose my disciple.

221
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,900
Remember.

222
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,580
Make sure you wait for me to come back before you draw the sword.

223

Do you understand?

224
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,780
Lu Li is not back yet.

225
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,100
I want to draw the Moon Sword.

226

Okay.

Liu Shao.

229
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,740
In fact, there is another reason why I want to draw the Moon Sword.

230
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,540
I want to find out my origin.

231
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,330
You want the Moon Sword so badly.

232

Why haven't you returned then?

233
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,940
Do you think he's really being nice to you?

234
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,010
He just wants you

235
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,940
to help him pull out the Moon Sword.

236
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,210
Our master is both Lu Sheng.

237

Liu Shao.

238
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,220
So he didn't tell you?

239
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,660
It seems he's been hiding a lot of things

240
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,700
from you.

241
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,340
Is he hiding something from me?

242
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,380
Brother didn't come back

243
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,940
I didn't see him all night last night.

244

How come?

245
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,660
It's such a big deal for Liu Shao to draw the sword.

246
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,170
How can he disappear at this time?

247
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I have a vague feeling

248
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,700
that something is wrong with Lu Li.

249
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,180
I'll go look for him again.

250

I'll go with you.

I'm leaving.

There are many things Lu Li didn't tell you.

254

Don't worry.

You and I are childhood friends.

Liu Shao can't compare with that.

And then charge her with collusion with the demon world

268

348
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,020
You can't withstand its devouring.

349
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,780
I can't?

350
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,100
But you can?

351
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,930
I'm sorry.

352
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,100
Actually...

353
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,780
Lu.

354
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,450
Congratulations.

355
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,620
You've got the Moon Sword.

356
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,100
Why are you here?

357
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,700
Did you forget?

358
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,050
You promised Master

359
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,460
that we'd return when we got the Moon Sword.

360
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,420
Now that you've completed your mission,

361
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,020
we can go back.

362
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,980
Bai Feng.

363
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,660
Please behave yourself.

364
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
What happens between me and Liu Shao

365
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,940
has nothing to do with you.

366
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,220
You've already got the sword.

367
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,620
Why are you still pretending?

368
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,740
Think about

369
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,460
how much I've suffered

370
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,980
due to this woman.

371
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,340
What are you talking about?

372
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,620
So you're just doing it for the Moon Sword, right?

373
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,940
Lu Li, you've been using me.

374
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,260
Don't listen to her…

375
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,020
How can you do this to me?

376
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,780
You made a vow under the Brahma tree before.

377
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,260
The millions of Water Hyacinths can prove it.

378
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,100
Liu Shao.

379
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,420
He just wants

380
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,700
the Moon Sword.

381
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,780
You are the only one who can unseal it.

382
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,780
That's why he treats you so well.

383
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,740
So…

384
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,700
I didn't.

385
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,660
The illusion in the Moon Sword was real.

386
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,170
You've been using me all along.

387
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,580
You've always hurt me.

388
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,500
I never wanted to hurt you.

389
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,740
Please don't make things difficult for him.

390
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,260
He doesn't need to hurt you himself.

391
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,260
Do you know

392
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,220
that you and the Moon Sword are spiritually incompatible?

393
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,340
Pulling out the Moon Sword

394
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
will cost your life.

395
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,540
Don't stir it up.

396
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,370
Liu Shao won't die.

397
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,700
I won't let her die.

398
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,980
Give me back the sword.

399
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,180
Liu Shao.

400
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
You can't touch the sword.

401
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,330
Liu Shao.

402
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,540
I didn't.

403
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,940
I never wanted to steal your sword.

404
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,140
Liu Shao.

405
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,890
Everything I've done is for today.

406
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,620
Once I get the Moon Sword,

407
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,980
I'll never care about that woman again.

408
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,940
I'll just show up and take the sword.

409
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,060
No.

410
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,100
Lu Li.

411
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,170
Lu Li.

412
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,740
Go away.

413
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,980
She's done this to you.

414
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,180
Why care about her?

415
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,090
It's all because of you.

416
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,140
It's because of you that Lu Li did this to me.

417
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,500
Liu Shao.

418
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,260
Don't!

419
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,340
Liu Shao!

420
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,780
That's interesting.

421
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,260
Is she going to

422
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,660
bring the sword to Aquatic Demons?

423
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,540
Lu Li.

424
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,140
Liu Shao.

He Na.

428
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,740
I'm sorry.

429
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,340
You were the only one I thought of.

430
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:31,940
Don't worry.

431
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,340
It's going to be okay.

432
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,460
Liu Shao.

433
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,980
You have to

434
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,420
trust me.

435

He Na.

436
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:53,900
Take me away.

437
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,460
Take me away.

438

00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,230
then it's my business.

517
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,420
I won't forgive you.

518
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,140
Do you like her that much?

519
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:47,900
Yes, I do.

520
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,940
Unfortunately,

521
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,780
you're not meant to be together.

522
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,300
The Soul-Devouring Spell will kill you.

523
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,380
And the Moon Sword will kill her.

524
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,860
Just listen to me.

525
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,580
I'm doing this for your good.

526
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,610
The Moon Sword?

527
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,700
The spiritual power of the Moon Sword

528
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,990
is actually devouring Liu Shao.

529
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,980
Their spiritual powers are mutually exclusive.

530
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,860
This is not a simple weapon backlash.

531
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,700
Liu Shao's spiritual power is so special.

532
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,020
But why was she able to pull out the Moon Sword instead?

533
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,380
The Moon Sword will kill Liu Shao.

534
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,740
So you knew all along.

535
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,580
This is unfair to Liu Shao.

536
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,500
Liu Shao has suffered so much

537
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,060
all because she helped me pull out the sword.

538
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,340
I'm going to ask Master

539
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,900
what he wants to do.

540
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,140
So what if you go?

541
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,740
Liu Shao won't forgive you.

542
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,740
Because she saw

543
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,370
me conspiring with you to kill her, right?

544
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,780
Bai Feng.

545
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,210
You planned so carefully,

546
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,580
hoping Liu Shao to take me wrong.

547
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,260
But what did she see?

548
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,660
What she saw was the real you.

549
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,650
But was what she saw

550
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,300
the real me?

551
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,460
You really disappoint me.

552
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:36,930
Immortal Master.

553
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,340
The Moon Sword had been pulled out by Liu Shao.

554
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,020
But then

555
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,740
she went missing

556
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,780
with another disciple, Lu Li.

557
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,340
There's no news of their whereabouts.

558
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,010
I have sent many people to look for her

559
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:47,900
and found

560
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,420
it seemed

561
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,380
to be related to the demon world.

562
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,220
The Moon Sword has been unsealed.

563
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,900
The feud it involves

564
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,900
is beyond our control.

565
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,060
Ignore it for now.

566
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,660
Let's wait.

567
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,900
Wait?

568
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,420
Wait for what?

569
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,740
Wait for a god who can control it.

570
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,500
Yes.

571
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,340
But I thought it's been 10,000 years

572
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,860
since a God has been born in Immortal Palace.

573
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,740
Immortal Luo Ge,

574
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,020
disciple of the Immortal Master Wanwu,

575
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,610
is said to be gifted

576
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,130
who has the potential to become a God.

577
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,340
Now, he's in seclusion

578
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,980
striving for the status of Immortal.

579
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,340
So it seems

580
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,140
Luo Ge should soon be able to become an Immortal

581
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,660
and dominate the Immortal Palace.

582
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,860
Liu Shao is just a mortal woman.

583
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,900
But she is devoured by the God of Moonlight's Moon Sword,

584
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,690
and still unaffected by the Melody Flute.

585
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,900
Liu Shao.

586
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,140
How many secrets are hidden in your body?

587
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,220
There is nothing I can do

588
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,620
with the devouring of God's weapon.

589
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,460
This is all

590
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,650
I can do for you.

591
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,900
Is Liu Shao

592
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,300
really hopeless?

593
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,010
At least there is no way to save her

594
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,420
with the power of the demon world.

595
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,380
In that case,

596
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,100
I'm relieved.

597
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,460
General Fu.

598
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,940
What do you mean by that?

599
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,500
My brother seems to have an interest in her.

600
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,500
He always wastes his time on her.

601
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,260
I'm tired of seeing her.

602
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,850
Although I don't like her,

603
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,420
I can use

604
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,140
the Moon Sword she has.

605
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,780
Since the Moon Sword is in our world,

606
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,020
it'll help with my next plan.
