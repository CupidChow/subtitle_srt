I may actually lose her?

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:47,979
I can feel

7
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,729
she's going to give me up.

8

I can't stay here for a hundred years.

No way!

This Baoyi Xuanjian

27

What about my brother?

30

He didn't prepare a gift for me?

31
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,579
I'm sure he did.

32
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,860
It's just that

33
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,140
he's been busy with the Four Seasons Monument thing.

34
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,860
So, he didn't have time to give it to you.

35

You don't have to comfort me.

36

I know

37
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,820
my brother doesn't approve of the marriage.

38

You must tell my brother.

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,860

I won't think nonsense.

As for gifts,

50
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,060
I don't care if he gives them to me.

51
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,740
I'm just afraid

52
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,140
that he will be torn

53
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,700
by this marriage.

54

56

57

is so strong.

58

60

that Luo Ge has agreed to the marriage.

62

There's no need to try.

65
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,060

If it wasn't,

86
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,780
why would your brother lock you up here?

87
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,580
It's because I hurt Luo Ning by mistake.

88

If my brother doesn't punish me,

174
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Let's not miss the auspicious time.

175
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,300
♫It blooms alone, but the wind and rain are more violent♫

176
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,880
♫Plants are not human beings, and ruthless fruits are planted♫

177
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,460
Let's go.

178
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,860
♫How can you forget the innocence and ignorance when we first met?♫

179
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,100
♫How many times do we have to reincarnate♫

180
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,050
♫Before we meet again in the next life?♫

181
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,190
♫Suffer all grief and long hate♫

182
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,030
♫Reversed right and wrong dreams♫

183
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,760
♫I exiled my thousand-year-old body♫

184
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,140
♫Waiting for the ashes to slowly burn in the heart♫

185
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,310
♫Wait until the end of life to see the begonia turn red again♫

186
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,740
What do you mean

187
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,980
by that?

188
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,740
Your brother

189
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,260
is planning to marry the one you love.

190
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,540
I have a treasure

191
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,900
that can unlock your brother's seal

192
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,900
so that you can regain your spiritual power.

193
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,900
Here is 30% of my power.

194
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,420
It's enough for him to get rid of

195
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,460
the Demon King in White's seal.

196
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,100
But he has to swear

197
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,380
to serve me as his master

198
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,980
and obey my orders

199
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,660
from now on.

200
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,860
Cooperation is possible.

201
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,660
Obey his orders

202
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,900
and take him as my master?

203
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,570
Even my brother wouldn't dare to talk to me like that.

204
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,930
If this is true,

205
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,300
it's between me and He Na.

206
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,380
As for him trying to control me,

207
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,500
no way!

208
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,500
General Fu, you...

209
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,700
Mr. Tai.

210
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,300
Think about it.

211
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,700
Is there something you

212
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,580
you didn't tell me?

213
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,780
General Fu,

214
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,100
the marriage

215
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,540
is not what you think.

216
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,660
It's true.

217
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,180
It's not what I think?

218
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,380
So He Na and Luo Ning worked together

219
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,780
to imprison me here

220
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,100
just to make me watch them

221
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,860
get married.

222
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,180
General Fu.

223
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,220
Don't fall for other people's provocations.

224
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,100
How could His Majesty steal your beloved?

225
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Don't lie to me.

226
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,980
So Mr. Tai,

227
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,060
please tell me

228
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,180
who He Na is going to marry now.

229
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,890
If you don't go,

230
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,740
Luo Ning will be crying.

231
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,220
This is?

232
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,500
This is a Ruyi pearl.

233
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,420
The scriptures Luo Ning has been copying

234
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,700
bear merit and virtue inside.

235
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,900
With the protection of my spiritual power,

236
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,340
it can ward off demons, calm the mind,

237
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,780
and protect her from disasters with blessings.

238
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,740
Please give it to Luo Ning for me.

239
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,940
Tell her it's from you.

240
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,140
Since you're so worried about her,

241
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,500
why don't you go see her off?

242
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
The closer she gets to getting married,

243
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,220
the more uneasy I feel.

244
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,020
I always feel like something is going to happen.

245
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,380
Liu Shao.

246
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,380
I don't want her to get married.

247
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,820
Now she has to get married even if you don't want to.

248
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,420
You don't want her to leave

249
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,660
without even seeing her brother, do you?

250
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,380
Looks like Luo Ge won't be coming.

251
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,380
Let's go.

252
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,450
Luo Ning.

253
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,180
Brother.

254
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,420
You're finally here.

255
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,100
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,380
I'm late.

257
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,700
I thought

258
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,620
you'd never talk to me again

259
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,020
because of this marriage.

260
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,860
Nonsense.

261
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,500
Whenever it is,

262
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,940
you will always be my closest sister.

263
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,500
This will never change.

264
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,940
This is the result of the countless scriptures you've copied.

265
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,700
It contains the power of goodness you've accumulated

266
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,020
since you were born.

267
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,980
It can be used to guide others and yourself

268
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,460
and avoid disasters.

269
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,260
Here.

270
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,900
So you're late

271
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,340
because you were preparing this for me?

272
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,140
Luo Ning.

273
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,620
When you've done what you want to do,

274
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,300
you can go home.

275
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,940
I won't make you copy the scriptures anymore.

276
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:43,900
Okay?

277
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,860
Deal.

278
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,140
I'll definitely come back.

279
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,740
It's my house.

280
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,060
No one else should be allowed to live there.

281
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,060
Okay.

282
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,180
Even if you want Palace Chonghua,

283
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,780
I'll give it to you.

284
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,820
That's nonsense.

285
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,860
If I live in Palace Chonghua,

286
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,260
where will you live?

287
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,410
To live with Liu Shao?

288
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,420
It's feasible.

289
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,660
The one who is late,

290
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,570
are you done?

291
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,810
The auspicious time has almost passed.

292
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,780
He Na.

293
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,220
I'll leave my sister in your hands.

294
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,380
I hope you won't forget your promise.

295
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,860
I will do everything I can

296
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,140
to make her as comfortable as she is

297
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,020
in the Immortal Palace.

298
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,460
And keep your brother in check,

299
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,740
in case he badgers my sister like a viper.

300
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,820
Brother.

301
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,580
He has been sealed by me

302
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,860
and is confined to his room.

303
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,330
He will never see Luo Ning again.

304
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,540
It's better this way.

305
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,060
Luo Ge.

306
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,860
You don't have to worry too much.

307
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,570
If you're worried,

308
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,100
when the curse is lifted,

309
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,740
we can bring her back.

310
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,500
Let her do as she wishes.

311
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,810
It's not necessarily a bad thing

312
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,260
to let her do what she wants to do.

313
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,140
Fu.

314
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,540
Are you going to

315
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,860
stop them from getting married like this?

316
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,780
Even if you're my savior

317
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,580
and I'd be willing to do your bidding,

318
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,810
I've managed to gather

319
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,260
the men,

320
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,220
are they going to get killed for you?

321
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,740
I've done a lot for

322
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,740
the men you collected too.

323
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,060
Don't worry.

324
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,980
I won't let them die in vain.

325
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,700
No matter what the future holds,

326
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,300
the top priority is to regain your power.

327
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,180
I said

328
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,460
no one could control me.

329
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,140
As for recovering my power,

330
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,930
it's not difficult.

331
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,300
He Na once swallowed the Pearl of Fire for me

332
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,220
and has endured the pain for ten years.

333
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,980
And I have been grateful to him for 900 years.

334
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,220
Since the brotherhood

335
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,140
can begin with the Pearl of Fire,

336
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,460
it can also end with it.

337
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,580
Do you want to break the Demon King's seal

338
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,900
with the Pearl of Fire?

339
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:45,980
You're crazy.

340
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,340
Water and fire are mutually exclusive.

341
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,220
That's what you Aquatic Demons are most afraid of.

342
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,620
Fu.

343
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,660
Fu.

344
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,340
Luo Ning is mine.

345
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,620
Her groom can only be me.

346
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,060
Why don't you do what I've arranged before?

347
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,420
Get out of here!

348
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,540
He Na.

349
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,660
The wedding

350
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,340
doesn't have to be so grand.

351
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,260
Luo Ning.

352
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,300
You are the benefactor of my people.

353
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,570
It's only right

354
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,620
to pay you with high courtesy.

355
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,780
The auspicious time has come.

356
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,540
Luo Ning.

357
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,580
Greetings to the Demon King and the Demon Queen.

358
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,420
Greetings to the Demon King and Demon Queen.

359
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,020
I won't accept your betrayal!

360
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,660
According to the rules of the demon realm,

361
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,010
drink this cup of wine,

362
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
then you will be recognized by heaven and earth

363
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,940
and truly become the Demon Queen.

364
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,420
Then from now on,

365
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,100
I will be able to use the Bone-corroding Harp freely

366
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,170
with the power of all the creatures in the demon realm.

367
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,300
Does that mean

368
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,380
I can also lift the 10,000-year curse?

369
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,140
Witnessed by the demon kings and queens of all generations,

370
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,660
by the Mother of Brahma Tree,

371
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,140
by all the people of the Aquatic Demons,

372
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,460
My Lord He Na

373
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,900
is marrying the fairy Luo Ning today.

374
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,540
Demon King and Demon Queen, please drink this together

375
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,700
to complete the wedding.

376
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,820
Your Majesty.

377
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,330
Your Majesty.

378
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,410
Something's happened in the demon realm.

379
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,900
Mr. Tai has been attacked too.

380
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,780
Luo Ning.

381
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
I have to leave for a while.

382
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,180
Wait for me for a moment.

383
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,140
What's happened to the demon realm?

384
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,300
Demon Queen, please follow me

385
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,300
and have a moment of rest.

386
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,940
We don't know who attacked Mr. Tai.

387
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,500
We only saw him lie on the ground with injuries.

388
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,580
The attacker is nowhere to be found.

389
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,820
Mr. Tai.

390
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,180
Come on.

391
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,860
Your Majesty.

392
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,020
What is going on?

393
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,900
Bai Feng…

394
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,380
Bai Feng has taken General Fu away.

395
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,540
He knows about your marriage.

396
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,460
General fu.

397
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,580
Please trust me.

398
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,020
And you must trust His Majesty.

399
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,700
He is your brother.

400
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Do you think I'll ever trust him again?

401
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,940
Fu escaped.

402
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,060
What bothers him most

403
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,140
should be my marriage to Luo Ning.

404
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,460
No.

405
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,220
Luo Ning.

406
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,650
Fu?

407
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,860
You…

408
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,660
Luo Ning.

409
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,300
No.

410
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,300
Now should I call you

411
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,580
Demon Queen?

412
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,260
You…

413
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,340
Where is Luo Ning?

414
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,460
Why am I back?

415
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,300
Shouldn't I be…

416
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,100
Fu?

417
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,100
You should be

418
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,780
at the Demon Palace,

419
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
married to He Na

420
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,380
as the new demon queen, right?

421
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,740
This is...

422
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,500
This is not the Immortal Palace.

423
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,100
It's not the Waterside Pavilion for Reflections.

424
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:18,900
That's right.

425
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,620
It's not Waterside Pavilion for Reflections.

426
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,620
I had a crush on a girl.

427
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,060
She's arrogant and wild.

428
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,340
I wanted to marry her so badly.

429
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,940
I was afraid she'll be wronged.

430
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
I was afraid that she'll get upset.

431
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,620
I prepared

432
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,580
a room exactly like her home.

433
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,740
I thought she should get used to it sooner.

434
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,140
So

435
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,980
this place was born.

436
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,620
You...

437
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,290
I thought you were locked up.

438
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,340
How did you get out?

439
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,140
And how did you get hurt?

440
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,620
I have to pay a price

441
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,660
for escaping

442
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,260
and regaining power.

443
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,940
It's ugly, isn't it?

444
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,380
Fairy Luo Ning must not like it.

445
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,740
But I like it.

446
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,820
Do you know why?

447
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,340
Because it hurts.

448
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,780
It can make me hurt for a long time.

449
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,700
It hurts so much that I remember

450
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,660
what it's like

451
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,660
to be betrayed by the two people I love most.

452
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,140
No one betrayed you.

453
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,780
You did the wrong thing.

454
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,140
You deserve to be imprisoned.

455
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,340
You shouldn't escape.

456
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,370
It's wrong just because you say it is?

457
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,380
If I didn't try, if I didn't fight,

458
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,100
my people would be desperate.

459
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,660
Does that give you the reason

460
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,620
to hurt innocent people

461
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,060
and my friends and loved ones?

462
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,580
I didn't want to hurt them either.

463
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,900
If I could,

464
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,180
I would like to be closer to your brother,

465
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,740
so that he would agree to our marriage.

466
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,780
But between your family and my clan,

467
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,260
I had no other choice.

468
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,690
Year after year,

469
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,300
I've seen too many of our people

470
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,780
living in torment

471
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,180
and dying unwillingly.

472
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,260
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

473
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,700
I know how you feel.

474
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,940
For a long time,

475
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,900
I've been willing to help you.

476
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,770
But what have you done?

477
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,540
Look at what you've become now.

478
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,810
You have become an unscrupulous madman.

479
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,940
Do you know it?

480
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,780
You're right.

481
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,980
It's my fault.

482
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,060
I hurt your family for the sake of my people.

483
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,780
I also hurt you.

484
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,060
I broke your heart.

485
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,180
But you can hit me, scold me

486
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,740
and stab me. I'll let you do it.

487
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,820
How did you get to my brother's side

488
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,180
and team up with him to imprison me?

489
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,780
Did you think about how I felt

490
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,620
in this wedding dress?

491
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,660
What does it matter to me

492
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,820
how you feel?

493
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,540
So I have given my heart.

494
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,620
Is that how you trampled on it?

495
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,140
Keep your heart.

496
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,780
I don't need it.

497
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,540
From now on,

498
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,860
I will only be your brother He Na's wife,

499
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,380
the Demon Queen of Aquatic Demons.

500
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,340
He Na's wife.

501
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,610
Demon Queen of Aquatic Demons.

502
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,100
Luo Ning.

503
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,940
Where do you put me?

504
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,700
Even if I'm wrong,

505
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,940
are what we've experienced

506
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,820
all fake?

507
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,420
What made you

508
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,740
fall into the arms of He Na so quickly?

509
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,660
Why can't I choose He Na?

510
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,620
Your brother is sophisticated and kind.

511
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,980
He's a hundred times better,

512
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,100
a thousand times better than you.

513
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,900
One is violent and hurts me.

514
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,090
The other is noble and kind to rescue me.

515
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,700
Who do you think

516
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,970
should I choose?

517
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:04,940
So

518
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,860
you've changed your mind long ago.

519
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,380
You've liked He Na for a long time, don't you?

520
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,180
No matter who I like,

521
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,020
I won't like you anymore.

522
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,420
I'm going back.

523
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,500
Take care of yourself.

524
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,780
And

525
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,660
from now on,

526
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,980
don't think you can do anything to me again.

527
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,620
Or else

528
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,460
your brother

529
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,100
and my brother

530
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,820
won't let you go.

531
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,980
Fairy Luo Ning.

532
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,260
What are you doing?

533
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:40,780
Let go of me.

534
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,140
Don't forget.

535
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,370
I am not He Na.

536
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
I don't back down.

537
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,860
I don't hold back.

538
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,340
What I want to do,

539
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,700
I will do it even at the price of my life.

540
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,700
And what I want to grasp,

541
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,940
I'd rather die than let it go.

542
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,660
And you

543
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,180
have always been mine.

544
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,100
No one can take you away,

545
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
not He Na,

546
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,580
not even your brother.

547
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,370
He Na.

548
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,700
Is this what you told me

549
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,540
that you'd try your best

550
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,620
to keep my sister safe for the rest of her life?

551
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,500
Is this what you told me

552
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,580
that you'd imprison your brother

553
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,860
for a hundred years?

554
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,740
I never thought

555
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,020
someone could break through my boundary.

556
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,460
Within the Three Realms,

557
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,180
few people can do that.

558
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,820
Now is not the time to talk about this.

559
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,540
The most important thing right now

560
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,020
is to find out where Luo Ning is.

561
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,050
What does Fu want

562
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,290
to take Luo Ning away?

563
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,980
He won't hurt Luo Ning.

564
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,810
I'm afraid he has no idea

565
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,500
how much he likes Luo Ning.

566
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,380
But Luo Ning is going to marry you,

567
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,820
his most respected brother and ruler.

568
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,140
The more he likes Luo Ning,

569
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,300
the worse

570
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,690
this is.

571
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,500
If Luo Ning can explain

572
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,380
it's just a nominal marriage contract,

573
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,900
Fu won't hurt her.

574
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,820
But you know Luo Ning's character.

575
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,300
She's a soft touch but not a hard one.

576
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,780
If Fu persuades her nicely,

577
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,730
Luo Ning may explain.

578
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,610
But if

579
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,139
Fu decides

580
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,820
she's changed her mind

581
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,900
and gets tough,

582
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,500
Luo Ning won't explain a word

583
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,210
even if she dies.

584
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
I'll go and bring them back.

585
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,620
Let's split up and look for them.

586
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:30,820
He Na.

587
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,940
You should know your brother best.

588
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,620
Shouldn't you try to remember

589
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,780
where he most likely goes?

590
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,260
I'll check the places he frequents now.

591
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,659
If there is any information,

592
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,179
I'll let you know right away.

593
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,100
I'll do whatever it takes

594
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,820
to keep him from making any more mistakes.

595
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,820
He Na.

596
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,860
This time,

597
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,620
I advise you not to protect him again.

598
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,180
Don't think of marrying He Na again.

599
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,460
From today onwards,

600
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,700
we will be a married couple.

601
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,140
The son of the Melody race, Fu,

602
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,380
is married to

603
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
the fairy Luo Ning today.

604
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,020
Witnessed by

605
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,060
the Heaven and Earth,

606
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,330
demon kings and queens of all generations,

607
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,940
from now on,

608
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,260
we will follow each other in life

609
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,300
and in death.

610
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,140
We will share the pain and suffering,

611
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,020
never to be separated.

612
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:43,820
♫In the sea of clouds, I looked at the reflection of the moon in the water♫

613
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,060
If I, Fu, break this vow

614
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,140
and fail Luo Ning,

615
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,980
heaven and earth won't allow it.

616
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,020
The gods and ghosts shall kill me,

617
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,970
leaving me lonely

618
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,000
♫I kept waiting and arched my palms into a circle♫

619
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,260
forever and ever.

620
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:57,810
♫The reflection gradually reminded me of our first meeting♫

621
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,500
Kowtow.

622
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,690
♫I can no longer tell the difference between wind and rain♫

623

♫Even if I get the volley sword♫

624

♫I can't forget you♫

♫Our destiny has been sealed long ago♫

626

♫I have no other choice♫

628
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,570

♫Can I use your hands to warm up the world again?♫

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,500
we'll be husband and wife.

632

♫A few hasty nights♫

633
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,580
Even if you get married to someone else later,

634

♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

635
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,500

00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,940
Your Majesty.

639
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,980
We've identified

640
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,570
his hiding place

641
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,780
through

642
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,420
the moss marks left on General Fu's clothes.

643
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,980
He went to the Great Wilderness

644
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,170
and never left.

645
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,780
Okay.

646
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,860
Give me the exact location of the mark.

647
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,300
I'll go there now.

648
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,140
Your Majesty.

649
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,930
General Fu

650
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,300
misunderstood you.

651
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,820
He always thought

652
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,140
Fairy Luo Ning married you and became the demon queen

653
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,340
because she fell in love with you.

654
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,620
Since it's a misunderstanding,

655
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,100
it can always be solved.

656
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,690
Shang Yurong, how is it?

657
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,100
What's the situation?

658
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,530
Has He Na come out yet?

659
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,540
There's no news yet.

660
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,020
But don't worry.

661
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,060
I'll keep a close eye on

662
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,020
the Moon Washing Pond.

663
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,850
Good.

664
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,620
Keep an eye on it.

665
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,220
Call me as soon as there is any news.

666
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,460
He Na.

667
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,420
I know what you're thinking.

668
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,940
I will never let Fu go.

669
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,220
Luo Ge.

670
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,100
You were right!

671
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,460
What did I say?

672
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,300
Demons can't be trusted,

673
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,580
not to mention building a marriage with them.

674
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,660
But you didn't listen to me.

675
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
You had to make Luo Ning suffer.

676
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,890
Immortal Master.

677
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,980
It's Fu who's causing trouble.

678
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,450
We can still trust

679
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,020
He Na.

680
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,700
There is news from Shang Yurong.

681
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,700
He Na has gone to the Great Wilderness.

682
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,620
He must have gotten a clue about Fu.

683
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm going to bring Luo Ning back.

684
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,700
Ge.

685
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
I'll go with you.

686
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,140
How can I feel at ease

687
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,820
without seeing Luo Ning?

688
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,500
Okay.

689
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,180
After worshipping Heaven and Earth,

690
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,460
here is the wedding wine I prepared for you.

691
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,140
Our wedding ceremony

692
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,820
will be complete

693
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,220
with this.

694
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,780
Wedding?

695
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,020
I think

696
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,060
this is a farce.

697
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,340
I don't care what you call it.

698
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,860
In my opinion,

699
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,100
we're already a couple.

700
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,140
After this drink,

701
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
even if you still want to go and get married to He Na,

702
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,500
I won't stop you.

703
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,170
Really?

704
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:01,820
Of course.

705
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,540
What?

706
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,460
Are you afraid of poison?

707
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,300
You won't kill me.

708
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,340
You wouldn't dare.

709
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,340
That's good.

710
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,290
[Joy]

711
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,770
Now that we've worshipped Heaven and Earth

712
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,260
and drunk the wedding wine,

713
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,820
now

714
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,900
even Heaven and Earth

715
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,300
have recognized us as a couple.

716
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,860
Who would dare to disagree that we are a couple?

717
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,980
Why did you summon the Bone-corroding Harp?

718
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,090
Bone-corroding Harp?

719
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,340
I didn't summon it.

720
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,460
Does it

721
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,460
think

722
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,820
I'm already the Demon Queen?

723
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,700
You won't be the Demon Queen.

724
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,300
Luo Ning.

725
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,060
The wedding wine you drank

726
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,610
was made from Phoenix Tears.

727
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,900
It will make you forget

728
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,820
your beloved ones.
