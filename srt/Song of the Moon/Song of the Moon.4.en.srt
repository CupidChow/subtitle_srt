4
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,930
Senior, you're hurt.

5
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,570
It must hurt.

6
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,580
Have a candy.

7
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,640
You won't feel so sad after.

8
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,680
After I have learned my skills,

9
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,900
I'll protect you,

10
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,090
just like Master protected us.

11
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,510
I won't let you get hurt again.

12
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,120
Junior, I'll wait for you to grow up.

13
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:44,950
Senior.

14
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,560
Watch out!

15
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,720
Senior.

16
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,710
Senior, why are you here?

17
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,100
I heard you were injured.

18
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,440
I came right away.

19
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,950
I asked someone to distract Wang Jian,

20
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,090
and came to see you secretly.

21
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,920
Take the medicine.

22
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,180
I made it specially for you.

23
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,400
Sister,

24
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,880
I'm not a kid.

25
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,100
I can do it myself.

26
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,960
Senior.

27
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,400
Liu Shao didn't make any trouble

28
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,700
in the past few days, did she?

29
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,720
No.

30
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,020
If anything happens,

31
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,070
I'm here.

32
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,500
Besides,

33
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,680
you still care about her

34
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,230
when you're sick yourself.

35
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,050
Actually,

36
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,680
it's not Liu Shao's fault.

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,910
She didn't mean it.

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,550
I don't blame her.

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,770
I just hope

40
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,190
you can get better soon.

41
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,630
Do you remember?

42
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,720
In order to practice magic,

43
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,910
we've been injured constantly since we were young.

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,710
We've been supporting each other

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,520
all the way here.

46
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,120
Master and Senior

47
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,430
are the most important people to me.

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,490
I'll do my best to protect you.

49
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,380
I won't let anyone hurt you.

50
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,940
Take the medicine.

51
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,430
The Moon Washing Stone won't be too far from the Moon Washing Pond.

52
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,080
Try to infer from the prayers

53
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,420
and go again on a full moon night.

54
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,100
It won't be hard to find.

55
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,880
The next full moon night is just around the corner.

56
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,230
I wonder if Wang Jian has sent my message.

57
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,640
Little girl.

58
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,940
Lu Li.

59
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,670
I've been looking for you. You're here.

60
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,610
Are you feeling better?

61
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,810
Are you worried about me?

62
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,910
With the Lord healing me,

63
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,500
this injury

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,720
is nothing.

65
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,480
Just wait.

66
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,660
I'll recover soon.

67
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,430
Let's make a deal.

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,900
We will

69
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,580
practice hunting demons together.

70
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,650
I will wait for you to come with me.

71
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,610
Okay.

72
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,750
Remember,

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,550
this trip to the Moon Washing Pond

74
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,440
is different from before.

75
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,910
On a full moon night,

76
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,380
demons appear frequently.

77
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,440
Even Ao Hen may be alarmed.

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,630
If you are in danger,

79
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,180
I

80
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,200
may not be able to save you.

81
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,580
Liu Shao.

82
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,640
What are you thinking about?

83
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,210
Nothing.

84
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,480
Actually,

85
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,290
I have something to tell you.

86
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,930
But when I see you,

87
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,940
I don't know what to say.

88
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,510
Oh.

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,820
You came to talk to me.

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,920
You don't know how to say it after meeting me.

91
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,120
This is beyond my duty.

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,800
It's not easy to set the price.

93

94
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,050

Come.

96
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,240
Here.

97
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,240
Take it.

98
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,050
What is this?

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,690
This is a recording stone.

100
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,160
It can store what you want to say.

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,790
Of course,

102
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,170
it can also record what others said.

103
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,110
Is it that magical?

104
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,620
Yes.

105
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,390
In this case,

106
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,070
you don't have to wait for me for so long.

107
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,810
Then put it here.

108
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,360
I'll record messages for you later.

109
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,030
Okay.

110
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,980
It's getting late.

111
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,620
You should go back and rest.

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,040
Okay.

113
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,490
He gave me this.

114
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,060
Does he have a lot

115
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,900

on a full moon night.

139
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,430
I should be able to find the Moon Washing Stone.

140
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,430
There is no Moon Washing Stone.

141
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,020
Aren't these ordinary stones?

142
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,670
The beautiful stone is like jade.

143
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,020
It shines brightly

144
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,150
like it has been washed by moonlight.

145
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,000
This must be the Moon Washing Stone.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,840
It can't be wrong.

147
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,060
Found it!

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,760
Where is the herb?

149
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,020
When you find the Moon Washing Stone,

150
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,750
irrigate it with blood.

The King Herb

152
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,630
will grow out of it.

153
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,030
Brother, how do you feel?

154
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,560
Although Wu Yang Duke has recuperated your body,

155
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,410
but your vitality is badly damaged.

156
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,590
You need to nourish it.

157
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,430
It's okay.

158
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,320
I have the resilience of a wild dog.

159
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,330
I've been fine for a while.

160
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,100
Your soup is good.

161
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,780
You're quite filial.

163
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,030
By the way,

164
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,390
when did Liu Shao say she was going to hunt demons?

165
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,280
Should I prepare now?

166
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,220
You still care about her at this point?

167
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,480
You still say you have no feelings for her?

168
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Man.

169
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,470
You...

170
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,310
You don't understand.

171
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,760
I do things for her for money.

172
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,520
Besides,

173
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,500
I'm working with injuries.

174
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,640
If she doesn't give me 3,000 or 5,000 taels,

175

It was all Liu Shao's idea.

It turned out that

202

this King Herb was so easy to get.

203
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,250
I thought

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,810
it would be very difficult.

205
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,690
That's because God of the Moonlight and God of the Sun

206
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,370
acknowledged the power in your blood.

207

The King Herb nurtured by their residual spiritual power

208

Is the lantern from the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

This lantern

220
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,890
can only scare the little Aquatic Demons.

No.

238

There's no Demon King who divulges part but not all.

239
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,440
I just pretended to be the Demon King in White

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,850
That's impossible.

348
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,540
The Demon King in White is a modest and scrupulous gentleman.

349
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,730
How could he be hostile to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

350
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,170
I think

351
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,270
with Liu Shao's cultivation,

352
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,160
it's a miracle that

353
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,630
she returned safely.

354
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,610
Ao Hen the great demon

355
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,630
and the Demon King in White,

356
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,360
these top demons

357
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,830
both let you go.

358
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,010
I wonder what Liu Shao

359
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,860
promised them?

360
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,290
Otherwise, how could you escape

361
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,930
from such a powerful demon like Ao Hen?

362
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,940
My Lord,

363
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,960
I think

364
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,020
Junior Liu Shao is very talented.

365
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,540
If she has the help of heaven and earth treasures

366
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,500
to complement the spiritual power and cultivate into a master,

367
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,520
she will natually be treated by great demons differently.

368
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,700
Treated differently?

369
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,330
Unless she betrayed the human race

370
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,010
and became a demon.

371
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,630
Liu Shao is a demon.

372
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,890
Maybe she has really become a demon.

373
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,860
No wonder she's so powerful.

374
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,990
It's a shame the Lord trusted her so much.

375
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,130
Xi died without any clear reason

376
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,470
after offending her.

377
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,260
Senior,

378
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,350
if I were a demon,

379
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,950
how could I enter the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke?

380
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,310
If you don't believe me,

381
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,950
I'll leave the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

382
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,580
Liu Shao.

383
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,210
What?

384
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,470
You took the King Herb,

385
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,520
and now you want to walk away?

386
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,070
Of course not.

387
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,660
Liu Shao meant that

388
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,510
she wants to go out and find the King Herb.

389
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,240
She wants to find the King Herb?

390
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,920
My Lord,

391
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,650
if I get the King Herb back,

392
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,750
can it prove the innocence of Liu Shao?

393
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,340
Yes.

394
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,190
OK.

395
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,460
Please give me some time.

396
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,430
I will find the King Herb for you.

397
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,770
Lu Li.

398
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,870
The King Herb

399
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,740
only grows one plant in a hundred years.

400
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,210
Can you do it?

401
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,310
I can.

402
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,070
If I can't,

403
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,840
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

404
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,380
Please

405
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,350
give us a chance.

406
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,630
Brother,

407
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,070
can you really get the King Herb again?

408
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,830
The King Herb grows for a hundred years.

409
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,890
There is only one in the world.

410
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,450
How could I get it so easily?

411
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,250
I'm not an immortal.

412
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,230
So you did it to buy time.

413
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,380
Why are you so down?

414
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,400
We still have time.

415
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,040
Don't worry.

416
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,350
I'm here.

417
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,560
It's okay.

418
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,260
Yeah.

419
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,690
Yeah.

420
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,070
We're here for you.

421
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,770
Liu Shao.

422
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,830
I won't let anything happen to you.

423
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,260
Do you understand?

424
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,410
Then think about it carefully again.

425
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,050
That fake Demon King whose face you didn't see clearly,

426
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,350
he's in white,

427
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,240
and he can turn water into ice.

428
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,630
Is there anything else special?

429
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,720
There's a pendant on his flute. It's pretty.

430
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,270
What does it look like?

431
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,730
Like this.

432
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,920
Every flute looks like this.

433
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,100
No, no, no.

434
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,690
It's different.

435
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,320
Here.

436
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,630
There is a flower, very special.

437
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,630
I've never seen it before.

438
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,320
Draw it for me.

439
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:04,910
Okay.

440
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,030
Like this.

441
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,280
Forget it.

442
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,840
You describe. I'll draw it.

443
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,700
I draw.

444
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,000
Watch carefully.

445
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,670
This is eichhornia crassipes.

446
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,790
These are the patterns of the royalty of Aquatic Demons.

447
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,400
The only one who can control all spirits in the Three Realms

448
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,710
with the melody of a flute is the Demon King.

449
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,410
Good Heavens.

450
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,920
He's really the Demon King in White.

451
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,680
He's not an imposter.

452
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,760
This time, I'll tear Ao Hen into pieces.

453
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,940
Aquatic Demons have been cursed for generations.

454
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,290
We live by water.

455
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,930
If we leave the water, we will die.

456
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,110
You just recovered.

457
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,790
Why are you going to find Ao Hen again?

458
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,810
She killed my clan for the demon energy.

459
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,120
How can I put up with it?

460
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:14,880
Brother,

461
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,730
why not try to overthrow the Four Seasons Monument,

462
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,950
eliminate Ao Hen,

463
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,250
unify the demonic realm,

464
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,350
and welcome the God of the Moonlight back.

465
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,070
Let him lift the curse for us.

466
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,790
But Fu,

467
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,140
don't you know

468
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,280
what the Supreme God under the monument did?

469
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,270
Can you guarantee that he won't cause trouble to the Three Realms again?

470
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,290
Do you still hope

471
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,100
to find the inheritor of Immortal Ze Shui

472
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,320
to lift the curse?

473
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,890
I have a clue about this.

474
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,140
The dignified Demons

475
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,450
has to rely on a woman to save.

476
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,800
No wonder even the little demons under Ao Hen

477
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,560
disregarded Aquatic Demons.

478
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,750
I have only one creed.

479
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,600
If you humiliate my clan,

480
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,030
I'll cut you into pieces.

481
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,760
What?

482
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,040
Your Majesty are going to the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke with that girl?

483
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,420
That's right.

484
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,400
She's not afraid of the sound of my Melody Flute.

485
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,530
It's most likely that

486
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,910
she's the reincarnation of Immortal Ze Shui.

487
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,680
If that girl

488
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,440
is really the inheritor of Immortal Ze Shui,

489
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,630
we will have a chance

490
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,840
to save Aquatic Demons.

491
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,380
When do you plan to leave?

492
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:28,590
A few days ago,

493
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,890
I made a fish demon double

494
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,490
to follow her.

495
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,290
But it can't last for long.

496
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,600
I need to go there soon.

497
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,820
Okay.

498
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,420
I'll arrange it now.

499
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,490
It must be here.

500
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,570
Regarding the King Herb,

501
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,840
I must repay this girl in the future.

502
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,400
But now for Aquatic Demons,

503
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,040
I have to confirm if she's the person I'm looking for.

504
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,900
I need a drop of her blood.

505
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,920
Demon King.

506
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,470
Who is it?

507
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,770
Oh no.

508
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,240
We can't stay here for long.

509
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,880
Such a powerful spell

510
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,120
must be the trick of Lu Sheng, the half demon.

511
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,060
You must be anxious.

512
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,740
I'll let you out now.

513
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,610
Go.

514
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,910
Find someone you should deal with.

515
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,100
Lu Li.

516
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,120
Since you want to climb above me so badly,

517
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,310
enjoy

518
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,870
the gift I gave you.

519
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,690
Lu Li.

520
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,490
I know

521
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,600
you've been running around for me.

522
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,670
Although you have a sharp tongue,

523
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,660
but

524
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,880
when they suspected me,

525
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,070
you trusted me and helped me.

526
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,550
Knowing that you're good to me,

527
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,190
I'm happy.

528
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,080
I'm very happy.

529
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,310
Lu Li.

530
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,360
When I was young,

531
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,670
I wanted to learn skills

532
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,110
to see mountains, rivers, the sun and the moon,

533
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,750
and the stars of the four seas.

534
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,150
That's what I want now too.

535
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,250
But

536
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,770
I hope I can have someone to accompany me

537
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,320
to go through the clouds and the sea

538
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,980
to experience the magnificent life.

539
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,170
I hope

540
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,910
that person is you.

541
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,429
Will you?

542
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,570
I hope

543
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,620
that person is you.

544
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,989
-Will you? -What am I talking about?

545
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,300
How do I get rid of this?

546
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,070
Hello?

547
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:26,429
Who?

548
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,230
It's me.

549
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,460
How long have you been here?

550
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,690
Not long.

551
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,040
I just came here.

552
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,350
Yes.

553
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,880
I've found clues about the King Herb.

554
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,760
You don't need to worry.

555
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,850
Tomorrow is the first time we go out for demon hunting.

556
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,780
You need to stay alert.

557
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,300
Go back and rest early.

558
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,870
You too.

559
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,180
I'm leaving.

560
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,120
Be careful this time.

561
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,960
I...

562
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,030
Although I'm smart and powerful,

563
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,370
and the reincarnation of the lucky child,

564
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,520
it's my first time hunting demons. I'm inexperienced.

565
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,990
Brother, you...

566
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,880
Are you so confident

567
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,180
to let me charge forward?

568
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,710
That day,

569
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,110
who lied to me?

570
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,150
Brother!

571
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,380
Brother, I was wrong.

572
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,110
You just want me to be the bait, right?

573
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,830
Then I'll go.

574
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,990
I always do this.

575
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,120
Watch out!

576
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,480
Demon!

577
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,740
Don't come to me.

578
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,540
I'm not tasty at all.

579
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,780
Don't come to me.

580
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,580
Don't come to me.

581
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,970
Don't come to me.

582
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,250
Xue.

583
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:40,940
Be careful.

584
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,350
Liu Shao.

585
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:25,560
Liu Shao.

586
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,110
Are you okay?

587
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:41,980
Be careful.

588
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,110
Xue.

589
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,120
-Xue! -Xue, wake up.

590
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,700
Xue.

591
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,260
Xue.

592
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,520
Liu Shao.

593
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,640
Where is Wang Jian?

594
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,280
Where is Wang Jian?

595
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,250
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

596
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,810
I never did evil before.

597
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:16,650
I was captured recently

598
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,070
and has been sealed.

599
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,040
Until two days ago,

600
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,300
he released me.

601
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,640
I was driven by the demon controling seal,

602
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,900
so I attacked humans.

603
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,950
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

604
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,510
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Your Majesty.

605
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,280
The spell in your body has been removed.

606
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,130
I'll cut off your demon power for 30 years.

607
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,850
You may leave.

608
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,980
Yes.

609
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,500
Wang Jian.

610
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,740
Who are you?

611
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,500
Tell me your name.

612
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,260
Demon King in White?

613
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,850
Why is he here?

614
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,530
Miss Liu Shao.

615
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,100
My name is Kho.

616
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,980
I'm your demon.

617
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,160
My demon? Kho?
