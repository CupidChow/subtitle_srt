[Episode 8]

4
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,259
Senior.

5
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,150
Have some water.

6
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,160
Senior...

7
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,100
What's wrong with you?

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,830
Are you all right, senior?

9
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,140
I'm fine.

10
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,180
Leave me alone.

11
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,000
You can off to go.

12
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,600
Senior,

13
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,790
I have something to ask you.

14
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,350
Lu Li.

15
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,070
What's the matter?

16
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,750
How do you

17
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,990
explain the fire in the Pearl Pavilion?

18
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,829
This matter has been conclusively attributed

19
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,230
to the grass demon.

20
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,550
You're still suspecting me?

21
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm so sad about this.

22
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm sad too.

23
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,390
Senior.

24
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,560
It seems that time would really change a person.

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,310
Listen to yourself.

26
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,030
What have I changed?

27
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,790
Actually, you're the one who has been changing.

28
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,480
We grew up together.

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,070
Master's way of educating us

30
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,720
was to leave us in the barren mountains

31
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,200
and let us live on our own abilities.

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,990
So we had to learn to be ruthless

33
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,350
and tough.

34
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,510
But do you remember

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,510
that we agreed

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,230
not to kill innocent people?

37
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,230
Of course I do.

38
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,350
So how are you going to explain the fire in Pearl Pavilion?

39
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,700
If it wasn't because I and Liu Shao's spiritual power restrained each other,

40
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,680
and we had special physical constitutions,

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,190
and if I hadn't arrived at the scene in time,

42
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,590
the demon fire would have killed her.

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,070
What if

44
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,110
I just meant to kill her?

45
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,030
Senior.

46
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,190
I will protect her

47
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,230
with my life.

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,960
Don't make me hate you.

49
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,470
Lu Li.

50
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,870
You won't kill me.

51
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,190
Beacuse you're too affectionate.

52
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,150
You've been pretending to be cruel.

53
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,630
Stop acting tough.

54
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,880
The demon fire belongs to Ao Hen,

55
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,510
and that mark belongs to you.

56
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,950
You should know what will happen to you

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,700
if I tell master about this,

58
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,710
right?

59
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,029
Master is different from me.

60
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,550
No matter who that person is,

61
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,110
no matter how close that person is to him,

62
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,000
he won't care.

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,830
Lu Li.

64
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,230
You won't do that.

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,110
You always say I've changed.

66
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,350
Maybe you're right.

67
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,070
I will do anything

68
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,590
for Liu Shao.

69
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,430
I know you don't want to see me like that,

70
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,950
and neither do I.

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,590
Captain Fang.

72
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,710
How is the Lord's refinement going?

73
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,110
It seems to be going well.

74
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,270
The Lord is saved.

75
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,880
And the human world is saved too.

76
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,990
That's good.

77
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,390
Done?

78
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,430
Yep.

79
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,150
What's wrong, My Lord?

80
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,830
My Lord!

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,200
My Lord!

82
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,590
My Lord!

83
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,550
My Lord!

84
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,150
Wan Sui took the blame for this?

85
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,300
I think it

86
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,740
must have something to do with Bai Feng

87
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,030
and Du Mingchong.

88
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,350
Liu Shao.

89
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,830
I want to pull out the Moon Sword.

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,310
Okay.

91
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,430
I'll help you.

92
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,670
You are not asking why?

93
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,730
You told me

94
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,630
that you wanted the mighty power of the Moon Sword

95
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,580
to counter those machinations

96
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,240
and protect the people you wanted to protect.

97
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,300
You want to protect me.

98
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
You want me to stop being afraid of Ao Hen

99
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,950
even after I leave Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

100
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,670
I told you

101
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,550
I would take you home.

102
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,680
You will eventually leave Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

103
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,070
and go home.

104
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,110
But

105
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,310
I have a request.

106
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,350
Even if you gain great power,

107
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,590
and I continue to hire you to protect me, but you can't...

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,910
You can't overcharge me.

109
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,550
You're right.

110
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,990
I charged you 30,000 taels of silver before,

111
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,950
but I forgot to mention the time limit.

112
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,080
What... You want to increase the price?

113
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,710
Then I'll set a time limit

114
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,150
until

115
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,950
the day I can't protect you anymore.

116
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,070
What day is that?

117
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,750
The day I can't protect a loved one

118
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,760
the day I am no longer needed,

119
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,920
and the day my life comes to an end.

120
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,590
That day will not come.

121
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,710
And even if it does,

122
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,150
I will protect you.

123
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,880
But

124
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,040
who is the loved one you mentioned just now?

125
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,390
Liu Shao.

126
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,910
In fact, there is another reason

127
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,190
why I want to pull out the Moon Sword.

128
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,110
I want to figure out my background.

129
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,880
Your background?

130
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,390
It was my master

131
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,950
who asked me to come to Marquis Wuyang's Mansion.

132
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,670
And Bai Feng…

133
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,080
Here they are!

134
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,240
Hurry!

135
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,030
-Hurry! -Hurry!

136
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,310
Go.

137
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,240
Hurry up!

138
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,790
Look what you've done.

139
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,430
What are you talking about?

140
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,910
What happened to the Lord?

141
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,390
The Lord has treated you well.

142
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,950
Why did you put poison on King Herb to kill him?

143
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,060
What? We didn't do it.

144
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,800
Captain Fang,

145
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,920
Are you sure the King Herb was poisoned?

146
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,210
The Lord started to refine King Herb soon after he got it,

147
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,620
and there was nothing unusual during that time.

148
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,350
If King Herb didn't cause it, then what else could it be?

149
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,870
Captain Fang.

150
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,440
Think about it.

151
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,670
Liu Shao worked so hard to obtain King Herb

152
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
because she wanted to use it

153
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,550
to gain a foothold here.

154
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,230
At this time, the Lord was suddenly poisoned,

155
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,150
and all his disciples lost their protection,

156
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,120
which was not a good news for Liu Shao.

157
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,880
Right. I'd be hunted by Ao Hen if I left here.

158
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,000
I really want the Lord to live a long life.

159
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,860
How could I try to kill the Lord?

160
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,980
It can't be them.

161
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,450
-Right. -How could she try to kill the lord?

162
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,780
That's right.

163
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,740
It can't be them.

164
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,270
Yes.

165
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,310
We may not know her at all.

166
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,430
I also don't think Liu Shao

167
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,470
would do it.

168
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,870
What about

169
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,630
the grass demon who gave us this King Herb?

170
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,480
Right.

171
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,530
King Herb is so precious.

172
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,550
Why did that grass demon give it to you so easily?

173
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,910
There must be a conspiracy.

174
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,500
That grass demon itself is the King Herb.

175
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,710
It's from the Immortal Palace and now has come back.

176
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,420
Are you going to say

177
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,800
that people from the Immortal Palace harmed the Lord?

178
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,060
No matter who was trying to kill the Lord,

179
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,140
there must have been something wrong with your King Herb.

180
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,320
We can only hold you accountable.

181
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,240
There is still half of the King Herb unrefined.

182
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,870
I will find a doctor to verify

183
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,430
what has been done to it.

184
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,880
But it was presented by you two.

185
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,350
This matter is definitely related to you.

186
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,990
My Lord.

187
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:35,990
My Lord.

188
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,670
-My Lord. -My Lord.

189
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,110
My Lord.

190
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,910
My Lord.

191
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,070
Captain Fang.

192
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,400
What do we do with these two villains?

193
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,900
I'll leave them to you.

194
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,510
Yes.

195
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,350
Behave yourself.

196
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:36,710
Lu Li.

197
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,470
Your cell is over there.

198
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,750
Lu Li.

199
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,670
Don't be afraid.

200
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,110
The truth will come out soon.

201
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,230
I promised that I would take you home.

202
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,950
Trust me.

203
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,230
Okay.

204
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,550
Lu Li.

205
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,160
I trust you.

206
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,390
But this time even Marquis Wuyang has been poisoned.

207
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,840
How do we break the deadlock?

208
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,310
Lu Li.

209
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,400
I told you

210
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,590
not to be with her.

211
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,610
Not only did she fail to achieve anything,

212
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,950
but she also dragged you into troubles.

213
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,860
You knew

214
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,350
Liu Shao and I are innocent, right?

215
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,510
Whether you are innocent or not

216
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,550
is up to Du.

217
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,470
Why does Du have the final say?

218
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,670
Shouldn't it depend on the truth?

219
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,480
Neither Marquis Wuyang nor Captain Fang can be in charge.

220
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,460
If Du says it's truth,

221
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,150
then it is.

222
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,910
There is not only Du in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion,

223
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,710
but also you.

224
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,990
I didn't expect

225
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,750
you would become so vicious one day,

226
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,790
that you would kill innocent people for selfish reasons.

227
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,270
Innocent?

228
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,120
Am I not innocent?

229
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,780
You're hurting me by protecting Liu Shao.

230
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,900
What does it have to do with you?

231
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,150
You are my senior.

232
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,590
You've always been my senior.

233
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,790
I was not just your senior.

234
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,660
It's all Liu Shao's fault.

235
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,680
She caught your heart with her seductive look.

236
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,830
It's all her fault.

237
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,720
All.

238
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,350
I will make you

239
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,710
and her regret.

240
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,880
How is the Lord?

241
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,220
The physician said

242
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,590
this poison is too vicious.

243
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,320
It doesn't belong to the human world.

244
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,460
I'll use my vitality

245
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,740
to protect the Lord's heart.

246
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,130
That could buy us some time.

247
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,510
But if we still can't find the antidote,

248
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,990
the Lord won't last long.

249
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,030
What can I

250
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,880
do for the Lord?

251
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,350
Marquis Wuyang's Mansion needs someone to take charge.

252
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,350
You should take the responsibility now.

253
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,040
Manage the daily affairs of the Mansion

254
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,310
and find out the truth.

255
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,340
As long as the Lord is alive,

256
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,110
I will always be his disciple.

257
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,220
Let me do this instead.

258
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,830
It is my job to protect the Lord.

259
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,430
If you are really so sincere,

260
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,150
you should secure the Mansion

261
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,030
and find the cure for the Lord as soon as possible.

262
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:09,790
Yes.

263
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,390
I'll do as you say.

264
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,560
[Qiutian Pavilion]

265
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,100
[Wu]

266
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,520
[Wu]

267
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,590
Secure the cells and increase patrols.

268
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,110
No one is allowed to visit them.

269
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,120
You may leave.

270
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,830
Yes.

271
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,670
[Wu]

272
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,470
The Lord of the Human World

273
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,510
who rules all human beings

274
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,840
will soon be me.

275
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,750
Bai Feng?

276
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,599
Congratulations, Marquis Wuyang.

277
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,470
Don't talk nonsense.

278
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,140
The Lord is still alive.

279
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,589
I'm just a temporary replacement.

280
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,910
The throne is so comfortable.

281
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,670
Are you willing to give it up?

282
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,460
Bai Feng.

283
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,550
Watch your language.

284
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,869
What are you afraid of?

285
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,310
There's no one else here,

286
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,630
and no need to play ignorant.

287
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,360
Don't act like I don't know what you did.

288
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,650
I didn't do anything.

289
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,510
What do you want?

290
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,790
Nothing.

291
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm just reminding you that

292
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,750
we will sink or swim together.

293
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,390
Don't try to kick down the ladder.

294
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,920
Otherwise, even if I die,

295
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,940
I will tell Captain Fang

296
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,470
what you did.

297
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,190
Senior Du,

298
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,700
I was just

299
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,950
reminding you.

300
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,760
As I said,

301
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,420
we will sink or swim together.

302
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,760
What exactly do you want?

303
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,030
I want Liu Shao dead,

304
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,870
and I will do it myself.

305
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,110
That's easy.

306
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,470
I want to keep Lu Li.

307
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,270
He and I have some unfinished business

308
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,150
to take care of.

309
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,430
It has nothing to do with yours.

310
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,800
Now,

311
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,590
you're going to take over Marquis Wuyang.

312
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,360
He is no longer a threat to you.

313
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,300
The matter of the Lord being poisoned has now been investigated clearly.

314
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,840
It was done by Liu Shao alone.

315
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,330
Lu Li was tricked and used by her,

316
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,900
and didn't know at first.

317
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,100
From now on, Lu Li is demoted to a lowly servant.

318
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,840
As for Liu Shao,

319
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,540
she will be left to Bai Feng

320
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,830
and excuted immediately.

321
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,020
Execution?

322
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,140
-Execution? -Execution!

323
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
How can this be

324
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,780
so serious?

325
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,470
Nonsense! Liu Shao didn't...

326
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,310
Senior Du.

327
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,380
Please don't blame her.

328
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,260
Xue was blinded by Liu Shao and couldn't tell right from wrong.

329
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,710
I'll go back and teach her a lesson.

330
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,760
You better.

331
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,540
We don't need people who don't know any better.

332
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,180
Yes.

333
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,870
I... I'll take her back now.

334
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:25,940
Wang Jian, you...

335
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,490
Stop talking.

336
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,600
Let's go.

337
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,580
Xue, stop biting me.

338
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,740
You deserve it!

339
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,820
You ungrateful man.

340
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,020
Have you forgotten how Liu Shao helped me?

341
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,060
No, I haven't.

342
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,270
But it is Du in charge now.

343
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,700
We can't play tough with him.

344
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,100
Do you really want to be kicked out of the Mansion?

345
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,950
Do you have an idea?

346
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,860
Isn't Liu Shao going to be executed?

347
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,620
But my brother is fine.

348
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,470
He's just locked in prison.

349
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,260
They will definitely excute Liu Shao

350
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,540
before releasing him.

351
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,140
I know.

352
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,520
But we can go to him.

353
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,460
He's full of ideas.

354
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,580
My grandfather

355
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,980
had a few old friends in the Mansion.

356
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,860
They can't do anything else,

357
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,700
but it's not a problem for us

358
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,750
to visit him.

359
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,230
Brother.

360
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,520
Brother.

361
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,380
Why are you here?

362
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,100
How are things outside?

363
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,050
Terrible.

364
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,670
The Lord is still unconscious.

365
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,660
Now Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

366
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,670
is basically under Du Mingchong's control.

367
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,240
Anyway, Bai Feng

368
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,320
doesn't look like a good person.

369
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,590
Xue is worried about Liu Shao.

370
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,980
It's useless to beg Bai Feng.

371
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,270
She will definitely kill Liu Shao.

372
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,980
In order to catch He Na,

373
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,710
she took Du to hurt Liu Shao.

374
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,670
I now get scared

375
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,310
every time I see her fake smile.

376
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,390
The fire in the Pearl Pavilion

377
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,110
must have something to do with her.

378
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,470
Help me find two people.

379
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,790
They should be able to help us.

380
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,110
Lu Li.

381
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,830
Lu Li!

382
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,750
Lu Li.

383
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,470
I wonder how Lu Li is now.

384
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,580
I don't know what Bai Feng

385
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,550
will do with Liu Shao.

386
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,120
Lu Li.

387
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,150
What should we do now?

388
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,110
I have to get out of here as soon as possible

389
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,160
to save Liu Shao.

390
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,190
I hope Lu Li is fine.

391
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,070
Yes.

392
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,000
We'll all be fine.

393
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,980
Unlock the door.

394
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,910
Yes.

395
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,100
Your verdict has come out.

396
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,230
Don't you want to know?

397
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,750
I don't think it will be a good news.

398
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,320
Lu Li said

399
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,900
that the King Herb

400
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,460
had been kept by you all the time.

401
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,790
He had never known that.

402
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,840
He also said

403
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,260
that you had been acting weird,

404
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,670
and were in contact with the demons.

405
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,310
Maybe you were bewitched by the demons

406
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,510
and asked them for poison to murder the Lord.

407
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,590
Because the evidence was solid,

408
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,710
Du has made his decision quickly.

409
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,220
Lu Li

410
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,800
was demoted to a lowly servant.

411
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:04,990
And you...

412
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,230
will be executed immediately.

413
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,280
This verdict

414
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,030
should be true.

415
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,160
But it must have been hard

416
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,870
for you to make up those lies.

417
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,780
I might have believed you,

418
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,040
if I didn't know anything about Lu Li.

419
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,780
You don't believe me?

420
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,870
Of course not.

421
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,750
Why not?

422
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,150
Because he's Lu Li,

423
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,950
and I'm Liu Shao.

424
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,710
You are really stuborn.

425
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,670
Fine.

426
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,630
Let's see if you still believe him

427
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,360
when you are about die

428
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,150
and no one comes

429
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,560
to help you.

430
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,270
You know magic too?

431
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,630
You're right.

432
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,540
Actually, I basically know every magic

433
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,080
that Lu Li knows.

434
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,950
Do you wonder why?

435
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,190
Why?

436
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,060
Because I grew up with him,

437
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,640
and was meant to be with him.

438
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
I'm his senior.

439
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,190
Lu Sheng is also my master.

440
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,340
It seems he still has a lot of things

441
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,550
to hide from you.

442
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,070
He must have done that

443
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,950
for a reason.

444
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,560
I still trust him.

445
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,700
I knew it.

446
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,420
People who have never suffered

447
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,060
are really naive and ridiculous.

448
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,110
Naive people

449
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,110
live a simple, happy,

450
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,270
free and open life.

451
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,540
There is nothing to be proud of

452
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,260
living a hypocritical

453
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,710
and unstable life.

454
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,680
How dare you laugh at me?

455
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,980
I'm laughing at

456
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,070
those hypocrites.

457
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,320
What?

458
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,940
Are you also like this?

459
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,750
Fine.

460
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,270
Then I will be frank with you.

461
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,110
Let me tell you

462
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,620
how much I hate you,

463
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,790
and how much I want you to die.

464
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,680
Liu Shao,

465
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,550
enjoy it.

466
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,340
I'll make you suffer.

467
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,320
I want you to know the truth.

468
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,540
Lu Li was just using you

469
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,360
to help him pull out the Moon Sword.

470
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,430
The evil ones are usually the most pitiful.

471
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,910
Your heart is too vicious.

472
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,570
And you are deluded yourself that Lu Li will like you.

473
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,300
But everyone will hate you

474
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,720
when they see your hypocrisy.

475
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,830
You...

476
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,550
Ao Hen.

477
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,670
I've prepared what you wanted.

478
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,600
You're here.

479
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,710
I brought you Liu Shao.

480
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,990
Good.

481
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,070
Take it.

482
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,500
This demon energy is yours now.

483
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,460
But you'll have to figure out

484
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,400
how to absorb it for your own use.

485
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,470
I have one more request.

486
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,070
Go ahead.

487
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,830
Liu Shao has made me so angry,

488
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,670
and made you suffered so much.

489
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,390
You have to let her die in pain.

490
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,030
No problem.

491
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,830
If Lu Li and He Na knew

492
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,300
that the person they wanted to protect so much

493
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,960
couldn't even die as her wish,

494
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,050
how would they

495
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,270
react?

496
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,640
In that case,

497
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,030
just stay here and suffer.

498
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,790
Lu Li,

499
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,430
I have persuaded Senior Du to let you go.

500
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,190
But he had to

501
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,390
let me seal your Qihai first.

502
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,790
Don't you trust me?

503
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,780
Of course I trust you.

504
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,560
It might hurt a little, so bear with it.

505
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,470
Lu Li...

506
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,190
Be careful.

507
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,070
Sit here.

508
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,110
Are you feeling unwell?

509
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,550
I don't want this to happen too.

510
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,700
When this matter is over,

511
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,340
I will ask Senior Du

512
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,950
to unseal your Qihai acupoint.

513
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,510
Thank you so much.

514
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,740
Try this.

515
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,710
These are osmanthus cakes that I made myself.

516
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,380
You used to love it the most.

517
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,590
And I picked these osmanthus flowers myself.

518
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,310
These are really like the cakes you made when we were kids.

519
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,260
You used to want to eat this

520
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,310
every time you were sick.

521
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,230
I worked so hard to get osmanthus

522
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,150
so that you can eat osmanthus cakes again.

523
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,630
Yeah.

524
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,790
I still remember

525
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,750
that after I got well,

526
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,740
I fed the rest of the osmanthus cakes

527
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,340
to a parrot demon.

528
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,830
You pretended not to care at the time.

529
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,230
But then the parrot demon disappeared

530
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,350
and never appeared again.

531
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,750
You really

532
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,960
haven't changed since you were a kid.

533
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,950
You would always get

534
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,700
what you want.

535
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,430
You're selfish and unscrupulous.

536
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,340
Your Qihai acupoint is not sealed.

537
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,270
How could this be?

538
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,790
And it's not just that.

539
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,390
It's master's Psychedelic Amulet.

540
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,590
Yes.

541
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,990
I also asked Xue to send a message to master.

542
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,770
Help me find two people.

543
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,930
I told him you wanted to kill Liu Shao.

544
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,170
Give it to Lu Li.

545
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,430
That will trap Bai Feng for at least one tor two days.

546
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,710
Yes.

547
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,000
Liu Shao is dead.

548
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,290
You can't save her.

549
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,930
I once left a wisp of spiritual power

550
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,220
in Liu Shao's lake bead bracelet.

551
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,830
That way I could sense her life and death.

552
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,080
When can you

553
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,990
stop lying?

554
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,170
Okay.

555
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,540
Even if she is not dead,

556
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,830
what can you do?

557
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,010
She has been controlled by Ao Hen.

558
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,720
The great demon, Ao Hen.

559
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,700
Are you able to defeat her?

560
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,830
How do I know if I don't try?

561
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,080
Let me out!

562
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,150
Let me out!

563
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,510
Let's see how long you can last.

564
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,710
Liu Shao.

565
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,750
Liu Shao.

566
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,070
Liu Shao.

567
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,470
It's great that you're fine.

568
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,990
Run. Don't worry about me.

569
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,160
Liu Shao.

570
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,030
I won't leave you.

571
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,630
Your love is so touching.

572
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,950
Fine.

573
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,910
Then

574
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,910
I will fulfill you.

575
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,070
Lu Li!

576
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,350
Lu Li!

577
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,190
Lu Li.

578
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,960
Lu Li, are you okay?

579
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,150
Just go. She just wants me.

580
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,630
Silly girl.

581
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,040
But I just want to save you.

582
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,750
Without Lu Sheng's help today,

583
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,790
let me see if you can escape.

584
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,750
Demon King in White?

585
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,870
He Na.

586
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,030
He Na.

587
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,280
Demon King in White,

588
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,909
you've saved your people.

589
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,800
Why are you still against me?

590
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,909
They are my friends.

591
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,510
Friends?

592
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,960
You are a demon king.

593
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,830
How could you be friends with the disciples of Marquis Wuyang's Mansion?

594
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,070
Why not?

595
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,190
Nothing.

596
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,980
Just don't forget

597
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,860
that you are an Aquatic Demon.

598
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,470
In the water, you do have a distinguished status.

599
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,030
But now it's on land,

600
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,940
I'm the king here.

601
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,020
How long can you hold without water?

602
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,990
You want to protect them?

603
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,700
Water?

604
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,120
We have plenty.

605
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,230
Liu Shao.

606
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,990
Get up.

607
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,350
Is this little water

608
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,070
enough for you?

609
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,510
What if I use the Water Amulet my grandpa left me?

610
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,510
Watch carefully.

611
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,790
I will

612
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,540
spare them today.

613
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,780
I'd like to see

614
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,030
how long you can protect them.

615
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,860
Don't go.

616
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,150
There's more.

617
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,270
Are you okay?

618
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,950
He Na.

619
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,490
Thank you.

620
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,870
Thank you, kid.

621
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,190
Young man,

622
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,990
I heard that the Water Amulet has disappeared for almost a thousand years.

623
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,170
It wasn't Water Amulet.

624
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,740
That was the Thunder Amulet.

625
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,150
I just used it to create some illusions of lightning.

626
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,140
Why didn't you say it earlier?

627
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,110
Now is the best time to tell you.

628
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,690
That's not the point.

629
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,720
Let's go out first.

630
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,340
You can't go.

631
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,540
You must not go back.

632
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,130
Let's find a place to rest first.

633
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,670
Let's go.

634
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,350
Okay.

635
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,640
Liu Shao.

636
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,450
Liu Shao.

637
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,010
Liu Shao.

638
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,670
Liu Shao.

639
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:09,830
Liu Shao.

640
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,710
Thank you.

641
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,470
Mr. Tai is the best doctor in the demon world.

642
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,390
His prescription is very effective.

643
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,070
She will wake up

644
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,150
tomorrow.

645
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,400
You were also seriously injured.

646
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,110
Go back and take a rest.

647
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,270
I'm fine.

648
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,210
He Na.

649
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,750
Thank you

650
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,430
for helping us this time.

651
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,910
I didn't expect that Wang Jian really found you.

652
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,710
And you were really willing to take the risk to save us.

653
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,630
It's my fault.

654
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,120
I should have left her a way to find me.

655
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,470
Otherwise, she wouldn't be like this,

656
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,350
and couldn't even be able to tell me.

657
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,270
He Na.

658
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:17,880
From now on,

659
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,350
I will do my best to protect her.

660
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,150
I won't let anyone hurt her again.

661
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,150
I know.

662
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,710
But now,

663
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,510
you are not capable of doing so at all.

664
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,310
Soul-Devouring Spell

665
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,790
will make you die very quickly.

666
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,590
How long can you live?

667
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,830
Do you still have time?

668
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,270
My Lord.

669
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,670
Mr. Lu.

670
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,640
The spy at Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

671
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,680
gave me

672
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,110
a tuft of Marquis Wuyang's hair.

673
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,790
I've checked it.

674
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,470
Is it weird

675
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,590
that one or two greedy people in Marquis Wuyang's Mansion

676
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,230
became our spies?

677
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,880
No.

678
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,230
You get to know the enemy better this way.

679
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,820
Mr. Tai, please go ahead.

680
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,280
What hurt Marquis Wuyang was the demon poison.

681
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,190
It was most likely done by Ao Hen.

682
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,220
This poison is refined

683
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,270
by collecting the resentment of many people and demons.

684
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,460
I can't

685
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,360
cure this poison.

686
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,720
Now that Marquis Wuyang is sick,

687
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,350
the Marquis Wuyang's Mansion is controlled by Du Mingchong.

688
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,510
Then Liu Shao won't be able to prove her innocence.

689
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,150
How can she go back to the human world?

690
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,430
I will go to Ao Hen again

691
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,040
if there is no other way.

692
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,920
She must have the antidote.

693
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,350
But she won't come to the water.

694
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,880
And you can't defeat her on land.

695
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,490
How are you going to get the antidote?

696
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,330
I have to

697
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,880
give it a try.

698
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,640
Now that Marquis Wuyang is in a coma.

699
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,670
If anything bad happens to you,

700
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,460
then the three worlds will definitely be in chaos.

701
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,350
My Lord,

702
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:07,470
although I can't

703
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,760
deal with this poison,

704
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,160
there is one thing that can work.

705
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,190
[Marquis Wuyang's Mansion]

706
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,030
Be careful. Don't get caught.

707
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,190
Stop!

708
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,340
-Senior Du. -Senior Du.

709
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,790
Where have you been?

710
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,960
We

711
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,110
just went around the demon world.

712
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,110
Demon world?

713
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,960
What were you doing there?

714
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,990
We heard that the Lord has been poisoned by demon poison

715
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,030
and wanted to see if there was any clue.

716
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,750
Demon poison?

717
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,990
So did you find any clues?

718
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,470
We were walking there

719
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,430
and then we seemed to enter the territory of Ao Hen.

720
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,190
So we hurried back.

721
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,070
But

722
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,310
we saw pieces of clothes all over the place there.

723
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,590
All over the place.

724
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,710
So I brought one back.

725
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,880
This belongs to Liu Shao.

726
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,280
Yes, she's right.

727
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,270
Wait, Xue.

728
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,360
Wasn't Liu Shao already executed

729
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,860
by Senior Bai Feng?

730
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,510
How could she appear there?

731
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,390
That's right.

732
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,430
But she deserved it as a traitor.

733
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,670
Ao Hen?

734
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,310
How could Senior Bai Feng have anything to do with Ao Hen?

735
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,270
You must be wrong.

736
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,670
Don't slander and spread rumors casually.

737
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,510
You're right.

738
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,480
We must be wrong.

739
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:46,990
You can off to go now.

740
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,110
Yes, senior.

741
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,550
Lu Li.

742
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,870
You've been staring at this tree

743
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,870
for a long time.

744
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,720
I'm just waiting for a flower.

745
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,240
I heard from Mr. Tai

746
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,020
that a female flower from the Brahma tree

747
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,970
can cure all poisons in the demon world.

748
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,080
But I think

749
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,190
this tree is dead.

750
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,460
The old demon, He Na told me

751
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,070
that this tree died longer than he lived.

752
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,010
Old demon?

753
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,470
Yes.

754
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,750
He Na is old.

755
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,390
He is one thousand and one years old.

756
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,310
I am much younger than him.

757
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,790
This tree died before he was born.

758
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,670
He had never even seen the leaves of this tree,

759
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,110
and let alone the flowers.

760
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,350
I heard that Liu Shao had woken up,

761
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,990
so I brought wine to celebrate.

762
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,880
I heard you talking about me from a distance.

763
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,390
Did I say anything wrong?

764
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,390
Nothing.

765
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,200
In fact,

766
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,670
the Brahma tree has started to wither since 10,000 years ago.

767
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,190
The Water hyacinth that grows from the Brahma tree

768
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,830
has always existed only in the story.

769
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,790
But that poison

770
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,910
only left Marquis Wuyang a maximum of five days to live.

771
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,580
How do we make this tree,

772
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,830
which has been dead for 10,000 years,

773
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,950
bloom in five days?
