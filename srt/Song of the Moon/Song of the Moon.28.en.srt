[Episode 28]

4
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,940
I'm fine.

5
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,300
But I've already told Liu Shao

6
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,020
that

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,539
I'm going back to the Immortal Palace with her.

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,060
What did you say?

9
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,610
Didn't you say you'd stay a few more days?

10
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,380
But I don't want to anymore.

11
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,260
Did Liu Shao tell you something?

12
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,740
No.

13
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,170
I thought it through.

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,500
Maybe

15
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,780
an immortal and a demon

16
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,460
really shouldn't be together.

17
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,660
The old Demon King and Fairy Ze Shui

18
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,260
are our best lesson.

19
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,660
Now that

20
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,420
you have regained your freedom,

21
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,420
stay in the Palace of Aquatic Demons

22
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,300
and be the General of Water.

23
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,140
I'm going back to the Immortal Palace

24
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,370
and be Fairy Luo Ning.

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,220
From now on,

26
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,940
we'll go our separate ways

27
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,140
and never meet again.

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,740
Isn't that better?

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,020
No.

30
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,620
I disagree.

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,780
Whatever.

32
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,660
Anyway,

33
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,260
I won't come to the Palace of Aquatic Demons again.

34
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,900
Don't come to the Immortal Palace either.

35
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,260
I said

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,020
I disagree.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,460
What do you want then?

38
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,700
You want to learn from the Demon King

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,230
and imprison me for life

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,240
or just kill me?

41
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,580
No.

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,420
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,780
In one night,

45
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,300
Luo Ning was totally different.

46
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,300
It must be Liu Shao.

47
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,300
Why is she leaving all of a sudden?

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,100
Luo Ning said she really missed her brother,

49
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,420
so she wanted to go back as soon as possible.

50
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,060
You're worried about Luo Ge too, and want to go back,

51
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:38,980
right?

52
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
In order to be with him,

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,730
you can bear any pain.

54
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,540
You can even seal the divine spirit.

55
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,810
You only think of my brother

56
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,620
when you need him.

57
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,340
At other times,

58
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,610
no matter how much he does,

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,780
you can't see it, right?

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,579
Fu.

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,300
What?

62
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,060
Did I say anything wrong?

63
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,900
Do you dare to show her the wound on your right arm?

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,580
After all this time,

65
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,060
she still doesn't know that your right arm has been broken.

66
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,530
He Na.

67
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,300
When pacifying demons,

68
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,260
it's inevitable to get hurt when encountering some powerful opponents.

69
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,500
I've already recovered long ago.

70
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,380
No wonder

71
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,899
you've been holding the flute with your left hand.

72
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,339
I was careless.

73
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,019
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,100
Shouldn't you ask him

75
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,580
how he got injured?

76
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,260
With the power of the Demon King in White,

77
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,940
he can even fight Immortal Feelingless.

78
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,940
Which demon is so powerful as to hurt him?

79
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,020
Enough, Fu.

80
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,180
Why?

81
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,500
When you saved her in the furnace,

82
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,700
has she ever thought about

83
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,460
what it's like for an aquatic demon

84
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,300
to be roasted by fire?

85
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,620
If you were not badly injured inside,

86
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,659
how could a mountain demon

87
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,940
break your arm?

88
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,860
It was an accident.

89
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,860
It's not your fault.

90
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,980
Fu.

91
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,659
What's wrong with you today?

92
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,380
Liu Shao.

93
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:01,980
Let me ask you.

94
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,300
What did you tell Luo Ning?

95
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,540
Why did she suddenly want to leave

96
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,540
and cut ties with me?

97
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,090
I want to know.

98
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,370
What did you say to her?

99
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,780
Or is it something you did?

100
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,540
I didn't.

101
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,220
And Luo Ning

102
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,090
is the treasure of Luo Ge

103
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,330
and the Immortal Palace.

104
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,300
She is also the heir of Immortal Ze Shui.

105
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,060
Who else can I get back at other than her?

106
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,620
She threw herself at me. She was stupid.

107
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,140
Do you want me to be like you,

108
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,020
someone who can't even keep the woman delivered to your door?

109
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,180
Fu.

110
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,260
The Three-legged Golden Crow and the Crown Wheel are the doppelgangers of the God of the Sun.

111
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,340
They all share the power of the God of the Sun's divine spirit.

112
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,540
I found these too.

113
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,220
He forced us

114
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,500
to read ancient books all night and think of solutions.

115
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,140
But he himself meditated comfortably.

116
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,940
He's an animal.

117
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,500
It seems Master Shang is not afraid of the sealing spell.

118
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,060
Right?

119
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,060
You...

120
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,300
Shut up!

121
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,780
You didn't even check the book closely.

122
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,660
You're just waiting for Liu Shao and Ning

123
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,580
to return to the Immortal Palace to help you, right?

124
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,660
Demon King asked me to come alone.

125
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,740
Do you have something to tell me?

126
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,140
Fairy Luo Ning.

127
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,020
Fu is impetuous.

128
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,370
Sometimes he talks without thinking

129
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,300
and doesn't care about others'feelings.

130
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,100
If he offended you,

131
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,780
please forgive him.

132
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,100
You called me

133
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,380
just to tell me this?

134
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,340
Fairy Luo Ning,

135
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,460
sometimes

136
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,700
Fu talks before he thinks,

137
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,090
but it's not what he really means.

138
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,810
Well said.

139
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,620
To see the nature of a person,

140
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,650
you should not just

141
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,020
observe his deeds.

142
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,300
His words

143
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,050
are important too.

144
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,740
Luo Ning.

145
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,220
Luo Ning.

146
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,530
This is for you.

147
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,420
This

148
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,740
is the same as the one my brother gave to Liu Shao.

149
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,740
I made this out of my demon energy.

150
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,380
You can use it to summon me.

151
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,380
No.

152
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,860
I also put a thread of my spirit into it.

153
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,060
If

154
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,900
I did something wrong to you,

155
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,980
stick needles in it.

156
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,340
It will definitely hurt me.

157
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,420
If you still feel angry,

158
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,660
you can just crush it.

159
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,740
I won't be able to get up.

160
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:39,659
Really?

161
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,700
Fu.

162
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,980
Fu.

163
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,860
Fu.

164
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,460
Demon King.

165
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,540
Goodbye.

166
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,660
Fu.

167
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,700
What are you doing?

168
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,660
She must've heard

169
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,810
what I said before.

170
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,620
If I don't do this,

171
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,380
she won't be able to vent her anger.

172
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,500
Since you like her,

173
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,740
you should be careful with your words and actions.

174
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,740
Don't you feel sad

175
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,540
when you made her angry?

176
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,020
But look.

177
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,740
She doesn't want me to hurt.

178
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,940
She put my pearl away.

179
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,980
After I left the Immortal Palace,

180
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,780
it's not easy for me to inquire about the Immortal Palace.

181
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,420
If she brings my spirit in,

182
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,740
it's like giving me a chance

183
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,260
to go in and out of the Immortal Palace freely.

184
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,620
Luo Ge is back.

185
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,650
The demon world is unified.

186
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,700
The three worlds are about to live in harmony.

187
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,740
Why do you have to do this?

188
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,970
No matter how harmonious the three worlds are,

189
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,100
we're still living by water.

190
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,140
Are you really afraid of the Immortal Palace

191
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,220
and just want to be a coward?

192
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,940
You...

193
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,660
I'm fine.

194
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,980
Go back.

195
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:22,980
Okay.

196
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,300
The God of the Sun's Crown Wheel can stop all evil spirits.

197
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,500
That's right. There are many things that the Crown Wheel can do.

198
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,860
I heard that

199
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,540
the Crown Wheel was made by

200
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
the God of the Sun with the broken pieces of her divine spirit

201
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,540
and the magic water of the Three-legged Golden Crow.

202
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,820
I heard that...

203
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,340
Liu Shao is back.

204
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,740
Yo.

205
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,780
You're back.

206
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,300
Liu Shao is back.

207
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,780
She didn't come to Palace Chonghua first.

208
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,060
Luo Ge.

209
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,340
You can't beat

210
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,180
Demon King in White who is gentle and considerate.

211
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,980
Is the Tears of the Half-Demon really so useful?

212
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,140
It's useless to me here anyway.

213
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:58,860
Take it.

214
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,940
Thank you, Luo Ning.

215
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,460
Have you really made up your mind?

216
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,660
Sealing the spirit is no joke.

217
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,300
But...

218
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,140
It's better than us not being together

219
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,940
and hurting each other without knowing it.

220
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,020
Then you'd better seal it.

221
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,090
Remember.

222
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,060
Don't tell your brother

223
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,860
about this.

224
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,260
That's easy for you to say.

225
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,580
How can I hide this?

226
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,380
Look.

227
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,060
We have to pick a date and set up a formation.

228
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,220
We have to ask the masters for help.

229
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,850
Besides,

230
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,860
my brother will find out sooner or later.

231
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,820
Knowing afterwards

232
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,020
and watching me suffer

233
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,220
are two different things.

234
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,500
All right.

235
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,740
As you know,

236
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,740
your brother seems cold

237
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,540
and doesn't talk much,

238
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,380
but he values love and loyalty.

239
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,900
I'm afraid once he knows,

240
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,460
he will blame himself

241
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,420
and suffer every day

242
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,740
before I sealed it.

243
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
If he loses his cultivation...

244
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,460
Liu Shao.

245
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,420
My brother is lucky

246
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,100
to have met you.

247
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,420
It's not easy for people who love each other

248
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,340
to be together.

249
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,700
I know

250
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,380
I should cherish my blessings.

251
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
You suddenly asked us to read ancient books,

252
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,650
do you want to find a fast way

253
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,820
to ascend to an immortal?

254
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,260
Get everything ready.

255
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,060
I'm doing this to help Liu Shao

256
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,620
cultivate her spiritual power.

257
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,610
You pretended to be so heartless.

258
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,980
Why would you cry with my water energy?

259
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,020
We'll go our separate ways

260
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,460
and never meet again.

261
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,020
You wish!

262
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,020
I won't let you escape.

263
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,770
Give me some more time.

264
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,180
For you,

265
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,420
for my clan,

266
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,900
I have my duties.

267
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,700
You promised to save my junior.

268
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,180
What are you waiting for?

269
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,780
What's the rush?

270
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,140
Leave it to me.

271
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,140
Come out, Fu.

272
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,860
I've suppressed Xie Lingqi.

273
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,900
What is so important that

274
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,060
I have to take such a big risk to get it myself?

275
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,530
A relic of the God of the Moonlight.

276
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,060
I purified and refined it

277
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,020
with my only remaining power of the God of the Moonlight.

278
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,980
The relic of the God of the Moonlight?

279
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,860
Yes.

280
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,500
Do you know it belongs to Xie Lingqi

281
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,340
and it comes from the Yin-yang Cave?

282
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,300
I see.

283
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,140
And you kept using his stuff

284
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,540
again and again.

285
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,140
Luo Ge will find out sooner or later.

286
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,540
Of course I know.

287
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,180
Do you think I'm afraid of him?

288
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,890
You're crazy.

289
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,940
Bone Melting Pool.

290
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,420
Immortal Luo Ge?

291
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,860
Are you looking for me?

292
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,900
What?

293
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,100
Are you surprised?

294
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,060
What are you trying to do

295
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,940
by deliberately revealing where you are?

296
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,540
Am I not you?

297
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,620
You don't even know what I want to do?

298
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,220
Your ability to escape is comparable to that of the General,

299
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,450
but don't teach fish to swim in front of me.

300
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,700
I happen to be sick of this body.

301
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,660
How useless.

302
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,540
You can't even protect the medicine.

303
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,500
It's a waste of my time.

304
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,980
Tell me.

305
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,660
Do you know who did it?

306
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,820
I think it was a woman.

307
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,220
A woman?

308
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,300
I smelled the fragrance of flowers.

309
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,140
The thing that took this bottle was cold.

310
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,170
It looks like a drop of water.

311
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,700
Could it be

312
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,620
Luo Ning?

313
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,500
That means

314
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,060
the evil spirit leaked out.

315
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,330
It's hidden

316
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,460
in Xie Lingqi's body.

317
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,020
I've removed the evil spirit in Xie Lingqi's body.

318
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,140
But I suspect there are other evil spirits

319
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,180
in the Immortal Palace.

320
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,060
Speaking of hidden evil spirits,

321
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,380
it must be the Yin-yang Cave

322
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,340
in the Immortal Palace.

323
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,690
Yin-yang Cave?

324
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,700
That place

325
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,660
used to be the place where my father was sealed.

326
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,220
There are a lot of insignificant evil spirits inside.

327
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,089
Since they were sealed by the Protection Spell,

328
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,700
there's nothing to worry about.

329
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,220
But

330
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,500
if the evil spirits in the cave are too turbulent,

331
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,860
they will leak out of the Four Seasons Monument.

332
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,740
Back then,

333
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,820
I was hurt by the evil spirit.

334
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,340
I grasped the Burning Sea 500 years ago.

335
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,100
So what?

336
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,660
That evil spirit

337
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,380
has damaged my immortal root.

338
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,620
If I don't remove it with Xilun Formation,

339
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,140
I will never become an Immortal.

340
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,380
But as you know,

341
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,900
how much it takes

342
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,420
to open the Xilun Formation?

343
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,660
The price is too high.

344
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,410
I can't afford it.

345
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,420
If you had told Zhuo Qiuxian

346
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,700
about this earlier,

347
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,730
I believe

348
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,380
she wouldn't have forced you to cultivate into an Immortal.

349
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,140
But it was my senior's wish for thousands of years

350
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,060
that I cultivate into an Immortal.

351
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,420
If she had to use the Xilun Formation

352
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,460
and sacrifice herself,

353
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,450
by then,

354
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,460
what should I do?

355
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,340
So

356
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,980
you'd rather listen to her nagging and get beaten by her

357
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,740
than tell her?

358
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,740
What can I do?

359
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,060
She is my senior.

360
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,860
Shang Yurong.

361
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,540
Get lost!

362
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,540
That heartless Luo Ge.

363
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,700
Master Shang.

364
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,220
What did Immortal Luo Ge do?

365
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,810
You said he has no conscience again.

366
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,940
It's none of your business.

367
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,420
Look at you, cursing like a shrew.

368
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,850
No wonder Master Zhuo looks so angry.

369
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,340
Don't talk about my senior.

370
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,980
Where is she?

371
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,780
Where is she?

372
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,540
Senior.

373
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,260
Senior.

374
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,700
It's my fault.

375
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,380
I should have been cultivating in the Palace of Abyssal Mirrors.

376
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,260
Luo Ge insisted that

377
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,340
I tell him something about the past.

378
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,020
Senior.

379
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
What did I do wrong?

380
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,940
Haven't you grasped the Burning Sea long ago?

381
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,100
Why didn't you use it?

382
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,740
Are you dumb?

383
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,340
Aren't you

384
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,370
usually quite talkative?

385
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
Zhuo Qiuxian.

386
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,660
Enough!

387
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,340
This is between Shang Yurong and me.

388
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,220
It's none of your business.

389
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,220
Do you really want to kill him?

390
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,260
Come in and talk.

391
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,060
I made a pot of good tea.

392
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,290
If he wants to cultivate into an Immortal,

393
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,580
he must sacrifice

394
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,580
a General or above.

395
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,180
He can't ascend to an Immortal.

396
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,810
He was also afraid that you would sacrifice for him.

397
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,210
He would rather lie to you forever

398
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,460
and make you resent him

399
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,140
for not going forward.

400
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
For the past 1,000 years,

401
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,980
he has been carrying this secret alone.

402
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Even though he is said to be

403
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,340
the most undeserving master of the three palaces,

404
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
he just didn't want to sacrifice anyone,

405
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,860
and

406
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,300
he didn't want you to be sad for him.

407
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,540
You knew I would come,

408
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,740
and prepared such a big gift for me.

409
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,810
If I didn't prepare this gift for you,

410
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,660
I wouldn't know

411
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,580
how long you will take me for a fool.

412
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,140
I didn't take you for a fool.

413
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,340
I...

414
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,780
I...

415
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,060
I did hide some things from you.

416
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,620
For example, I saved Bai Feng.

417
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,260
But that's not because I wanted to do it.

418
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,300
It's because she used me before.

419
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,460
And I also saw that she's useful to me.

420
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
That's why I saved her.

421
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,540
It's not what you think.

422
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,410
Really?

423
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,620
Bai Feng assassinated the Immortal Master

424
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,860
and almost killed my brother and Liu Shao.

425
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
When you saved her,

426
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,180
have you ever thought about me?

427
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,500
That was in the past.

428
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,500
But can you also think about

429
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,140
how good I was to you?

430
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
You're shameless!

431
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,700
Luo Ning!

432
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,700
Luo Ning,

433
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,060
don't be mad at me.

434
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,300
If you want to vent your anger,

435
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,420
can you hit me?

436
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,420
Can you scold me?

437
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,500
Stop being hypocritical.

438
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,420
You've been lying to me

439
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,300
from the beginning.

440
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,020
Even...

441
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,660
Even that night.

442
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,140
So,

443
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,050
do you even despise and shun me,

444
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,700
a monster who live on water

445
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,100
and will die out of it?

446
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,660
You keep showing your weakness

447
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,620
to seek my sympathy.

448
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,160
♫The begonia is red, but every promise makes it more withered♫

449

450

it's still the same.

451
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,450

♫It blooms alone, but the wind and rain are more violent♫

453

454

But what I got in the end

455
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:29,590
♫Plants are not human beings, and ruthless fruits are planted♫

456

is your

How many times have you

461
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,290
entered the Immortal Palace with this pearl?

462
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,020

But I just came to see you.

466
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,180
I didn't do anything.

00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,449
Hurry.

685
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,460
Hurry!

686
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,170
Ask for help from the Immortal Palace.

687
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,620
No, no.

688
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,659
You can't go.

689
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,060
You really can't go.

690
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,420
Immortal wants you to cultivate in peace.

691
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,980
Do you want me to watch the innocent die?

692
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,260
Immortal Master Wanwu said

693
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,260
he would send the disciples of the Immortal Palace to rescue them.

694
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,820
I'm familiar with the Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

695
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,500
I can help those disciples.

696
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,980
Let me go.

697
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,260
Help!

698
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,460
The ground is cracking.

699
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,380
Help!

700
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,500
Hold on.

701
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,100
Stand firm.

702
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,100
If we're thrown on the water,

703
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,380
we'll all be dead.

704
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,660
His Majesty will save us.

705
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,580
Hold on.

706
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,340
My brother is stabilizing the demon world.

707
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,580
I'll take a look.

708
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,900
Your Majesty,

709
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,460
it was you

710
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,700
who stabilized the demon world by yourself.

711
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,180
Where's Fu?

712
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,430
[Elegant and Graceful]

713
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,700
It's a fairy.

714
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,100
A fairy is here to save us.

715

[Mansion of Wu Yang Duke]

716
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,940
Liu Shao.

717
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,580
I knew you would come to help us.

718
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,700
Wang Jian, Xue,

719
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,540
are you okay?

720
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,620
We're fine.

721
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,540
It's just that the demons are coming in a fierce manner

722
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,620
and hurting civilians everywhere.

723
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,540
Now,

724
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,740
we are also in fear.

725
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,740
We don't know what to do.

726
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,620
Didn't Immortal Master

727
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,620
send the disciples of the Immortal Palace to help?

728
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,620
Something must have delayed them on the way.

729
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,820
No one else has been here.

730
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,060
What about He Na?

731
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,130
He is the Demon King.

732
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,380
He won't sit by.

733
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,420
We sent someone to the Moon Washing Pond to inform them.

734
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,580
But something happened to the Aquatic Demons too.

735
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,820
No one responded.

736
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,420
Bad things happen in the mortal world and the demon world at the same time.

737
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,860
What are the chances?

738
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,300
Don't worry about

739
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,900
Mansion of Wu Yang Duke.

740
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,820
I've sent disciples to the mortal world to check.

741
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,060
As for the crisis in the demon world,

742
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,060
the Aquatic Demons

743
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,610
always solve their own problems.

744
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,380
Focus on your cultivation.

745
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,100
Don't be disturbed by these problems.

746
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,140
I'll check the Four Seasons Monument later.

747
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,060
You stay here

748
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,340
and continue your cultivation.

749
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,740
It doesn't matter.

750
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,700
I'll go with you.

751
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,620
Liu Shao.

752
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,340
I have a bad feeling.

753
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,540
There seems to be some power surging.

754
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,340
I wonder if anything happened

755
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,780
with He Na.

756
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,690
I've used up all my demon power

757
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,140
to protect the underwater demon world.

758
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,620
Looks like we have to find another way.

759
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,900
Do you admit your mistake?

760
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,580
What did I do wrong?

761
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,660
You stole the demon king's demon energy

762
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,180
and almost destroyed our foundation of ten thousand years.

763
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,820
Foundation of ten thousand years?

764
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,540
Brother.

765
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,780
I really forgot

766
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,660
our foundation is on land.

767
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,250
All the demons had to listen to us.

768
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,340
If we don't break the Four Seasons Monument

769
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,180
and beg the Supreme God to break the curse on our clan,

770
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,610
we will not have the chance to return to land.

771
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,650
Brother, you don't know, do you?

772
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,780
I heard that there's an auspicious sign in the sky.

773
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,460
Luo Ge is about to be deified.

774
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,940
When will you

775
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,340
face the reality?

776
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,540
I asked our clansmen if they would

777
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,580
live like cowards or die fighting.

778
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,700
Listen to our generals' answer.

779
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,980
We are willing to fight to the death.

780
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,740
We don't want to live like cowards.

781
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,580
We will smash the Immortal Palace

782
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,460
and return to land.

783
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,900
Mr. Tai.

784
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,820
Do you think so too?

785
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,060
Your Majesty, please go to the Immortal Palace,

786
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,540
break the Four Seasons Monument,

787
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,140
release the God of the Moonlight,

788
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,540
and lift the curse on our clan!

789
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,660
Release the God of the Moonlight,

790
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,580
and lift the curse on our clan!

791
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,260
Do you know

792
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,660
the one under the Four Seasons Monument

793
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,180
has long been contaminated by evil spirits.

794
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,980
He's no longer a pure God of the Moonlight.

795
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,860
Once he is out in the world,

796
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,940
the three worlds will be in chaos

797
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,900
and all living things will be in misery.

798
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,620
When I was in the Immortal Palace,

799
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,420
the Supreme God once appeared in my dream.

800
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,660
He promised to break the curse

801
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,890
after he's released.

802
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,620
What does the rest

803
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,220
have to do with us?

804
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,060
Your Majesty, please go to the Immortal Palace

805
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,580
break the Four Seasons Monument,

806
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,260
release the God of the Moonlight,

807
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,780
and lift the curse on our clan!

808
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,660
Release the God of the Moonlight,

809
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,700
and lift the curse on our clan!
