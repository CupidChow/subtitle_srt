[Episode 16]

4
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,300
Tomorrow, I'll set up a magic circle under Lusitai.

5
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,700
And use Liu Shao's flesh

6
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,060
to refine the Blood Amulet.

7
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,170
I'm willing to help you

8
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,060
to protect the magic circle.

9
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,100
No one is allowed to go near Lusitai

10
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,940
for three days.

11
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
Yes.

12
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,259
No way.

13
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,060
Is it true that Immortal Luo Ge

14
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,100
is going to use your flesh to refine the Blood Amulet?

15
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,260
Yes.

16
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,450
Why?

17
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,860
Restoring the Four Seasons Monument is so important.

18
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,579
You are too weak to bear it.

19
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,940
It is said that I have the Power of the Sun.

20
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,420
The Four Seasons Monument was sealed by God of the Sun.

21
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,140
Of course I have to contribute.

22
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,780
To contribute with your life?

23
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,579
Exactly.

24
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,500
I only have one life.

25
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,100
Who would like to

26
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,579
risk their lives to bet?

27
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,930
Of course.

28
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,940
To bet on what?

29
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,420
To bet

30
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,140
that Luo Ge

31
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,100
is still that Lu Li who loves me,

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,140
and doesn't want me to die.

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,180
But...

34
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,340
what if he is really willing

35
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,300
to fill the Four Seasons Monument with you?

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,180
Liu Shao,

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,460
have you made up your mind?

38
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,220
The seven talisman pearls

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,780
are related to your soul.

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,980
If I said no,

41
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,940
would Immortal Palace give up

42
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,820
taking my blood

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,740
or would you give up

44
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,860
refining amulet with me?

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,500
Neither would Immortal Palace nor me.

46
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,900
Although I have the Power of the Sun,

47
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,980
I never hurt anyone.

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,420
Whether it's Immortal Palace or you

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,140
filling the monument

50
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,780
with my blood

51
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,700
is both a betrayal of me.

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,650
Yes.

53
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,780
It's me who betrayed you.

54
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,780
It's not Immortal Luo Ge who betrayed me,

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,220
but you,

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,740
the man standing in front of me.

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,260
Not only did you fail to keep your promise

58
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,620
to protect me for the rest of my life,

59
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,610
but you also

60
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,020
hurt me, betrayed me,

61
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,300
and used my blood to fill the monument.

62
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,370
Lu Li is the one who promised you, not me.

63
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,650
You are Lu Li.

64
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,980
There's no such a person in this world.

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,500
Then just tell me,

66
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,779
who is that affectionate Lu Li

67
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,940
who would cry, laugh,

68
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,180
and would sacrifice his life

69
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,260
because of a little obsession in his heart?

70
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,090
Even if he did exist,

71
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,260
he's long dead by now.

72
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,180
Now that Lu Li is dead,

73
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,700
I will keep my promise

74
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,300
to die with him.

75
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,820
I hope I can still

76
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,980
catch up with him in the other world

77
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,180
and still get to see

78
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,330
his beating

79
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,500
moon-shaped heart.

80
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,780
Lu Li...

81
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,940
Wait for me.

82
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,530
The restoration of the Four Seasons Monument has begun.

83
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,540
Looks like

84
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,140
those talisman pearls are working.

85
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,180
That's great.

86
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,780
What a good news.

87
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,140
Isn't this migic circle

88
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
being hosted by Immortal Luo Ge all the time?

89
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,980
Why did I just see him go back to Xiyin Mountain?

90
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,660
It can run on its own

91
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
without being hosted by others.

92
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm leaving.

93
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,930
I'll go back to wash up

94
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
and go to bed.

95
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,210
The person who looks the same as Lu Li

96
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,820
is no longer the caring

97
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,020
and affectionate Lu Li.

98
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,740
It seemed that Lu Li

99
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,580
was really gone.

100
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,900
So you are the traitor.

101
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,340
I will tell you all this

102
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,770
with paper money from the human world

103
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,700
on the seventh day after your death.

104
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,570
Immortal?

105
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,620
What else

106
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,420
do you have to say now?

107
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,180
I just don't want you

108
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,740
to be seduced by this mortal woman.

109
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,820
So I destroyed her flesh

110
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,620
and left her divine spirit for you.

111
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,020
Even without her flesh,

112
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,420
you can still use her divine spirit to refine the Blood Amulet, right?

113
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,260
How can I make it

114
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,420
without her flesh?

115
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,380
You are still playing fool,

116
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,020
Xie Lingqi?

117
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,260
You can execute me

118
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,820
to test my innocence

119
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,620
if you still have doubts about me.

120
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,900
You have been wrapped in demon aura.

121
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,770
Why are you still in denial?

122
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,940
Take a good look at it.

123
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,340
You really think the Protection Spell you broke into is a Blood Amulet magic circle,

124
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,020
and you are still

125
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,820
on Lusitai?

126
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,420
Ge.

127
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,660
Didn't you say that this time

128
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,590
you could escort the spy of the Demons back to Litian Temple?

129
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,860
But why did you use the Star Teleportation spell

130
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,340
to bring General Xie here?

131
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,020
Immortal.

132
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,210
Immortal Master.

133
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,420
I...

134
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,860
I'm innocent.

135
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,700
From Protection Spell being damaged

136
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,380
to Ziji Shield being exploited

137
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,580
to Bone-Corroding Harp's demon voice

138
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,220
hitting the cracks of Four Seasons Monument straight on.

139
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,410
So,

140
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,500
Ao Hen knew where the Ziji Shield was,

141
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,740
and knew which part of the Four Seasons Monument was the weakest.

142
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,180
Exactly.

143
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,700
So I was sure

144
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,460
that she had colluded with someone here.

145
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,700
So I deliberately told everyone

146
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,060
that I would use Liu Shao's blood to refine the talisman pearl

147
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,060
to restore the Four Seasons Monument.

148
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,260
All I know is

149
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,580
that Liu Shao has agreed to use her flesh to refine the talisman pearl

150
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,180
in order to restore the Four Seasons Monument.

151
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,090
I did all these just to lure you out.

152
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,860
You have been wrapped in demon aura.

153
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,660
What else can you say?

154
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,540
I've been killing demons in the Three Realms,

155
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,860
so it's inevitable that I would be contaminated with some demonic aura.

156
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,780
You're right.

157
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,740
I really can't stand

158
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,860
Liu Shao

159
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
and hate her.

160
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,060
I admit it all.

161
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,570
But you have no right to say

162
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,780
that I colluded with the demon world and tried to destroy Immortal Palace

163
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,770
on the basis of this incident alone.

164
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,220
Immortal.

165
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,100
General Xie, as the guardian of the monument,

166
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,020
has been in the Immortal Palace for more than a thousand years.

167
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,420
He could not have waited until now

168
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,540
if he had already got a different intention.

169
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,060
Such a strong demon aura.

170
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,980
How many years have you colluded with the Demons?

171
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,620
It looks like

172
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,380
it has been more than ten years.

173
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,100
No.

174
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,900
I didn't.

175
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,060
Who is it

176
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,780
that you colluded with?

177
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,690
I don't know.

178
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,210
Your qualifications and cultivation are above mine.

179
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,700
Why would you...

180
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,260
Yeah!

181
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,770
I also want to know

182
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,450
why someone like you

183
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,980
could become the Master of the Palace Wuxie.

184
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,780
You did all this for such a trivial matter?

185
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,740
A trivial matter?

186
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,860
I, Xie Lingqi,

187
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,260
have been working hard for so long

188
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,010
to help the Three Realms of Immortal Palace.

189
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,460
I have participated in more than a thousand campaigns

190
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,180
and more than ten thousand

191
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,380
battles

192
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,700
to protect Immortal Palace's Regulation.

193
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,980
I've had more injuries

194
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,540
than I can count.

195
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,820
But in the end,

196
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,220
I couldn't even compare with that pompous

197
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,650
Shang Yurong.

198
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,860
And you.

199
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,660
I got this new scar

200
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,770
to protect you when Luo Ge was in retreat.

201
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,980
You haven't forgotten all that, have you?

202
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,940
All of you

203
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,500
are just staying out of this matter.

204
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,980
How many of you are like me

205
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,940
who fought hard on the blood-soaked battlefield

206
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,140
to get where I am now?

207
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,300
So someone used the resentment in your heart

208
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,740
to infuse the demon aura into your heart step by step.

209
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,220
I don't care why you colluded with him.

210
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,660
You'll be a prisoner of Immortal Palace

211
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,700
for the rest of your life.

212
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,860
Guards!

213
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,660
Yes.

214
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,140
Put Xie Lingqi in Bone Melting Pool

215
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,220
for eternity.

216
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,260
I'll go there by myself.

217
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,780
So, you and Luo Ge

218
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,260
set this all up together?

219
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,650
Hush.

220
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,060
You've been acting with Luo Ge

221
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,980
since the conferring ceremony.

222
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,340
Although Luo Ning said you were useless,

223
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,300
the person who set this up with Luo Ge

224
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,260
could never be useless.

225
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,570
Now you know

226
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,100
how important I am.

227
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,570
I didn't treat you unfairly.

228
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,620
I got a lot of energy cultivation pills from Luo Ge

229
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,100
for you.

230
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,140
Look at you.

231
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,650
You look much better.

232
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,900
That's because I was useful.

233
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,900
Not only could I help you make talisman pearl,

234
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,460
but I could also be your bait.

235
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,500
Don't blame it all on Luo Ge.

236
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,780
You were not the only one he was cruel to.

237
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
He was more cruel to himself.

238
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,460
In order to experience hardships in the mortal world,

239
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,860
he sealed his five senses,

240
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,100
and even removed half of his heart

241
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,140
to fall into the mortal world.

242
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,300
He has suffered so much more

243
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,660
than you've done

244
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,980
in refining of Blood Amulet.

245
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,740
So tell me,

246
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,810
for a ruthless person like him,

247
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,860
is he good or evil?

248
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,140
All he gets is what he wants.

249
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,060
The tragic ending of Lu Li

250
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,660
is just a tribulation for him to become an Immortal.

251
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,300
Others,

252
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,140
even if they fell into hell for eternity,

253
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,420
would just be a light touch

254
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,660
in this tribulation.

255
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,250
They can be ignored at any time.

256
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,620
Why?

257
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,260
You rushed back to check the injury of Miss Liu

258
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,900
after dealing with the matter of the spy, didn't you?

259
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,700
I'll go back first.

260
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,089
Liu Shao.

261
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,380
Can you take it

262
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,859
if I ask you to take two more talisman pearls?

263
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,859
Why should I do this?

264
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,140
After you trampled on my heart,

265
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
I still need to dedicate my body

266
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,859
to fulfill your honorable reputation

267
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,540
of guarding the Three Realms?

268
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,100
Do you ever feel guilty?

269
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,740
Yes, I do.

270
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,300
But I have to make my choice

271
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,260
since I have responsibility.

272
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,940
Sacrifice yourself then.

273
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,260
Sacrifice yourself to fill that Four Seasons Monument.

274
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,450
Why do you expect a mortal like me

275
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,180
to sacrifice my body, my mind

276
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,020
and even my life?

277
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,420
Why should I do this?

278
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,970
Sacrifice yourself then.

279
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,490
Sacrifice yourself to fill that Four Seasons Monument.

280
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,460
Why do you expect a mortal like me

281
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,020
to sacrifice my body, my mind,

282
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,930
and even my life?

283
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,570
As long as I'm here,

284
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,260
you will never come out,

285
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,380
even without the blood talisman pearl.

286
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,940
Ge,

287
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,020
The Four Seasons Monument hasn't been fully restored yet.

288
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,140
Why did you remove the magic circle?

289
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,020
Liu Shao has taken out four talisman pearls,

290
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,980
and restored more than half of the Four Seasons Monument.

291
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,900
She has done enough.

292
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,940
Since there's a chance to restore the Four Seasons Monument completely,

293
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,620
why did you give up?

294
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,460
Have you forgotten about

295
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,980
what was suppressed under the monument?

296
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,300
It was half of God of the Moonlight's heart.

297
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,050
Back then,

298
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,580
the Three Realms were in chaos,

299
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,210
and the demonic aura arises.

300
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,940
In order to protect the worlds,

301
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,460
the God of the Moonlights sealed the demonic aura by himself.

302
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,940
But unexpectedly,

303
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,100
that demonic aura has formed a mind and turned into an evil creature.

304
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,740
It controled God of the Moonlight.

305
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,780
The God of the sun had to kill him

306
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,860
and suppressed the half of his heart

307
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,460
under the Four Seasons Monument.

308
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,940
And you were born of the other pure part of his heart.

309
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,940
You should know what your mission is.

310
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,060
Now, the Four Seasons Monument is turbulent.

311
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,020
The demonic creature under the monument

312
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,220
could come out anytime to harm all beings.

313
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,300
Ge,

314
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,020
you can't miss any chance

315
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,260
to eliminate the hidden danger.

316
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,620
The best way to eliminate the hidden danger

317
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,460
is to become a God as soon as possible.

318
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,100
But I failed this woman during my tribulation.

319
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,500
If I used her once again as a stepping stone,

320
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,940
it would harm my morality

321
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,580
and be bad for me to become a God.

322
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,820
But,

323
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,140
she is a mortal after all.

324
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,460
A mortal is also a human being.

325
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,980
Moreover,

326
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,620
how could someone possessed by Sun Spirit

327
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,660
be an ordinary person?

328
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,900
Immortal Master,

329
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,980
listen to my advice.

330
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,980
Don't push her anymore.

331
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,860
What if she helps the Demons?

332
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,220
Ge,

333
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,820
do not forget

334
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,380
that so far she hasn't tell us

335
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,300
about the origin of that demon string.

336
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,900
Greetings, Immortal Master.

337
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,020
You've been here for a while, right?

338
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:15,860
Yes.

339
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,900
What do you want from Immortal Palace?

340
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,780
I've always admired Immortal Palace.

341
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,780
I want to stay here to cultivate

342
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,740
and protect the Three Realms.

343
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,770
Was it out of kindness when

344
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,130
you saved the lower-level disciple of Immortal Palace

345
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,650
the other day?

346
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,170
Since I've been cultivating myself,

347
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,100
saving people is just an instinct of mine.

348
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,420
You were the disciple of Marquis Wuyang,

349
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,180
and senior of Lu Li.

350
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,620
You were deprived of the disciple because of Liu Shao,

351
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,980
so you hold a grudge against her.

352
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,580
The reason why you saved people in the immortal world

353
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,020
was just to

354
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,820
stay in Immortal Palace to take revenge on Liu Shao.

355
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,460
Am I right?

356
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,980
Immortal Master, I...

357
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,940
Take it.

358
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,620
Do you know what I gave you?

359
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,180
I don't think

360
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,540
I should ask you about it.

361
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,060
It is the Golden Pill that can improve your cultivation.

362
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,780
From today onwards,

363
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,180
I need you to go to Xiyin Mountain,

364
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,340
and protect Luo Ge for me.

365
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,060
Protect Immortal Luo Ge?

366
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,380
Are you willing to

367
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,500
see Liu Shao arouse Luo Ge's feelings,

368
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,660
and then they finally become a couple?

369
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,810
No, I'm not.

370
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,300
Fine.

371
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,540
Then I'm counting on you.

372
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,660
You're only allowed to stop them from being together.

373
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,500
Don't do anything stupid.

374
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,540
Otherwise, you will be punished.

375
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,900
Yes.

376
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,220
Liu Shao,

377
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,620
can you stop crying?

378
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,380
How many tears

379
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,860
have you shed today?

380
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,420
Even my leaves

381
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,380
are pickled by the salt in your tears.

382
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,260
Then why are you walking around in front of me?

383
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,700
I'm just worried about you.

384
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,900
There's nothing good about Immortal Palace.

385
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,460
It's not even as good as the Pearl Pavilion.

386
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,420
At least when I closed my eyes,

387
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,740
I would see Ling Xueyang smile at me.

388
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,620
You are right.

389
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,740
What's so good about here?

390
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,420
Everytime I opened my eyes,

391
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,940
I would see someone with the same face as Lu Li.

392
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,500
But every words he said

393
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,220
were like knives

394
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,740
that stabbed my heart.

395
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,810
I've figured it out.

396
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,060
Perhaps...

397
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,220
he's not Lu Li at all.

398
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,410
He's just a jerk who stole the appearance of Lu Li.

399
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,420
Liu Shao, did you notice that...

400
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,020
the immortals in Immortal Palace

401
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,940
always like to appear and disappear mysteriously?

402
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,580
I'll visit you later.

403
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,820
Yes.

404
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,700
I wonder what kind of Immortal

405
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,970
would always eavesdrop behind others.

406
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,050
Lu Li wouldn't do that.

407
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,580
Lu Li

408
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,860
used to call himself an Immortal.

409
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,580
But he was a liar.

410
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
We promised each other

411
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,580
that we would only be mortals for a lifetime,

412
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,300
instead of being immortals with loneliness of thousands of years.

413
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,700
I'm afraid I can't return the Bone-Corroding Harp to you

414
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,540
because it was connected by demon string.

415
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,660
Take this ice string zither as compensation.

416
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,970
You can learn this Great Tone and Six Senses Symphony first,

417
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,260
if you have time.

418
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,340
It can help you calm your mind down.

419
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,940
I can teach you if you have any questions.

420
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,420
So,

421
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,860
the reason why you gave me the zither

422
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,450
and music score

423
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,100
was just to make me forget about

424
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,460
my relationship with Lu Li.

425
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,180
It's your call if you want to keep that memory.

426
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,140
Okay.

427
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,260
I will forget.

428
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,210
I'll forget about everything since I met you at Immortal Palace,

429
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,220
and keep what you've forgotten

430
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,090
in my mind.

431
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,580
They are playing the zither together.

432
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,100
Interesting.

433
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,820
Then they are not far

434
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,740
from falling in love, right?

435
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,500
Where have I heard this song?

436
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,090
This is

437
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,580
the sound of the Brahma tree blossoming.

438
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,540
Brahma tree?

439
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,300
Was it Aquatic Demons

440
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,780
who repaired the Bone-Corroding Harp for you?

441
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,300
Yes.

442
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,300
Liu Shao, you're finally awake.

443
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,340
How did I fall asleep?

444
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,860
Wasn't I playing the zither with him?

445
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,020
You seem to have betrayed He Na just now.

446
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,860
Where is the Demon King in White?

447
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,060
It is Luo Ge from Xiyin Mountain.

448
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,980
Luo Ge?

449
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,860
I'll go meet him.

450
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,340
Don't you go out.

451
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,410
Lu Li?

452
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,940
I'm Luo Ge,

453
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,900
from Xiyin Mountain.

454
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,020
Luo Ge?

455
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,980
We Aquatic Demons live underwater

456
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,180
and don't ask about the outside world.

457
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,940
Immortal Luo Ge,

458
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,380
tell me why you're here.

459
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,860
I'm here

460
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,260
to ask you something.

461
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,460
Did you give this string

462
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,620
to Liu Shao?

463
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,300
Yes.

464
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,940
You created chaos in Immortal Palace

465
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,660
and caused many innocent deaths.

466
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,140
The Four Seasons Monument got unstable and the three worlds were in danger.

467
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,060
He Na,

468
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,740
You are unforgivable.

469
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Fu.

470
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,820
Stop!

471
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,220
He Na, are you okay?

472
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,820
I'm fine.

473
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,660
The reason why you gave me ice string zither,

474
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,020
talked to me about the past,

475
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,140
and let my guard down,

476
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,260
was to get me to betray He Na.

477
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,140
I just need the truth.

478
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,180
The truth is he did give me the string.

479
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,980
But he did it to save me,

480
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,330
not to use me.

481
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,140
So,

482
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
you'd rather believe the words from a demon,

483
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,260
right?

484
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,820
If you were Lu Li,

485
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,460
you would believe him too.

486
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,980
Not only did he save me,

487
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
he also saved Lu Li,

488
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,500
again and again.

489
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,340
The demon string came from Demon King.

490
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,060
You can't deny this, can you?

491
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,700
Even if the matter was not related to you,

492
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,580
it was at least related to the demon world.

493
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,220
I'll give you one day

494
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,260
to find out the truth.

495
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,620
I've cast Protection Spell around your palace.

496
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,850
In one day,

497
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,060
no one

498
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,700
is allowed to leave.

499
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,500
In order to find out the truth,

500
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
you need to know

501
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,020
what happened that day at Lusitai.

502
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,420
Brahma tree,

503
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,380
if you dare to shake my mind,

504
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,140
don't blame me for ruining your foundation.

505
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,140
That's what happened.

506
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,300
When I was fixing the Four Seasons Monument,

507
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,420
I felt that the string were controled by others,

508
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,660
instead of me.

509
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,660
That's why

510
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,020
the Immortal Palace Boundary was destroyed,

511
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,900
and demons made a lot of mess there.

512
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,980
Lu Li protected us.

513
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,700
But I failed to protect him.

514
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,380
I didn't expect

515
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,260
this Immortal

516
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
looks exactly like Lu Li.

517
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,700
He is Lu Li.

518
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,780
He has just forgetten the past.

519
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,210
Or maybe,

520
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,140
Lu Li

521
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,570
is an insignificant existence

522
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,500
in his thousand-year life,

523
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,860
just like dust,

524
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,500
can be slapped away easily.

525
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Immortal Luo Ge

526
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,330
is famous for being heartless.

527
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,740
But I don't understand.

528
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,540
Since Immortal Luo Ge is heartless,

529
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,060
why would he turn into that sentimental Lu Li

530
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,540
when he came to the mortal world

531
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,220
to overcome his tribulation?

532
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,620
Liu Shao.

533
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,090
Sometimes,

534
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,780
persistence

535
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,730
may only hurt you.

536
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,100
I'm not persistent.

537
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,620
All I care about

538
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,900
is Lu Li,

539
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,650
not this heartless Luo Ge.

540
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,620
Now,

541
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,660
he forced you to look for the truth.

542
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
Do you have any clues?

543
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,420
We can only declare that

544
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,980
we found Immortal Ze Shui's hair.

545
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,340
We can't  tell him

546
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,100
that our spiritual veins can be replaced.

547
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,300
If something happens to Bone-Corroding Harp again,

548
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,460
they will come back to us.

549
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,700
You are powerful enough.

550
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,900
But I can't take it any more.

551
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,780
One more extraction might

552
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,020
take my life.

553
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,220
I didn't recall anything yet.

554
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,060
Let me think about it.

555
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,100
Do you have any wine?

556
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,060
Of course.

557
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,420
I'll ask someone to give it to you.

558
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,219
Prove it.

559
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,500
Prove what?

560
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,449
Prove that you're no longer Lu Li, a mortal.

561
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,739
It was under this tree

562
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,739
that day,

563
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,540
where Lu Li told me those sincere words after he was drunk,

564
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,580
and made me a promise for a lifetime.

565
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,219
Madam,

566
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,699
you once bloomed ten thousand flowers

567
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,380
to witness it for us, right?

568
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,460
What are you doing?

569
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,210
Now you are even interfering with

570
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,180
the feeling of a tree?

571
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,460
It was too noisy.

572
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,780
You are afraid to face it,

573
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,140
or drink this wine.

574
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:28,910
♫In the sea of clouds, I looked at the reflection of the moon in the water♫

575
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,460
You're afraid that after drinking it,

576
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,140
you would become Lu Li again.

577
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,480
♫I kept waiting and arched my palms into a circle♫

578
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,420
Lu Li no longer exists.

579
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,910
♫The reflection gradually reminded me of our first meeting♫

580
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,340
Prove it to me then.

581
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,100
Even if you are an Immortal,

582
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,900
♫I can no longer tell the difference between wind and rain♫

583
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,020
you can't change the fact

584
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,940
that you have stepped on my sincere heart

585
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,220
on your way

586
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,620
to become an Immortal.

587
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,790
♫Even if I get the volley sword♫

588
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:52,980
Luo Ge.

589
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,930
♫I can't forget you♫

590
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
You owe me.

591
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,580
♫Our destiny has been sealed long ago♫

592
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,400
♫I have no other choice♫

593
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,120
♫Why have you been so far away from me every time♫

594
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,650
♫For billions of years♫

595
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,180
♫Can I use your hands to warm up the world again?♫

596
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,630
♫A few hasty nights♫

597
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,860
I told you Lu Li no longer exists.

598
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,890
I'm still Luo Ge.

599
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,200
♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

600
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,260
Nothing has changed.

601
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,360
♫Have shattered my dreams♫

602
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,680
♫Who would like to take a broken willow branch♫

603
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,260
♫And watch the moon alone in the blue sky♫

604
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:53,910
♫The remaining flowers in the mirror reflect the moon in the water♫

605
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,980
Yes,

606
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,580
Lu Li no longer exists.

607
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,960
♫We can't live up to such a good time♫

608
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:08,040
♫Recalling the unforgettable glance at the beginning♫

609
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,000
♫I realized that it was a thousand years ago♫

610
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,820
♫Is this bad luck, or good luck?♫

611
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,500
So...

612
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
the face that looked exactly like Lu Li,

613
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,530
♫He said that responsibility and love are difficult to balance♫

614
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,250
and the way he looked at me once in a while,

615
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,010
♫He had no choice but to leave me♫

616
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,460
were all faked.

617
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,670
♫The past has passed, do not linger♫

618
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,900
Even if he has Lu Li's heart,

619
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,620
♫My love for you is still so strong♫

620
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,060
he's not Lu Li.

621
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,760
♫Too many intertwined oaths and lies♫

622
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,740
Lu Li

623
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,060
is really gone.

624
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,180
♫Have shattered my dreams♫

625
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,080
♫Who would like to take a broken willow branch♫

626
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,700
♫And watch the moon alone in the blue sky♫

627
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,820
What's wrong?

628
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,260
Why do you have that look on your face?

629
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,260
So it was you behind

630
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,460
all those incidents on Lusitai.

631
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,500
You had planed everything

632
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,220
when you gave up the spirit vein.

633
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,180
Do you think I did anything wrong?

634
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,380
Do you still think you did the right thing?

635
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,740
Do you know how many people have died

636
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,620
in that battle?

637
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,780
Of course I know.

638
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,540
Even the great demon Ao Hen,

639
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,820
who was your only opponent in the demon world,

640
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,100
has died over there.

641
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,860
Isn't it good for us

642
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,780
to rule the entire demon world?

643
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,900
So what?

644
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,930
Can we set our feet on shore?

645
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,340
So...

646
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,700
so we need to break the curse.

647
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,140
But have you ever thought about

648
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,850
what will happen

649
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,620
if that evil creature under Four Seasons Monument is released?

650
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,660
I thought it through.

651
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,140
It might cause chaos to the three worlds,

652
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,300
or bring trouble to all living beings.

653
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,740
But so what?

654
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,660
As long as we break the curse

655
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,020
to free the Aquatic Demons,

656
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,700
so that we can walk freely

657
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,740
under the sun,

658
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,180
anything

659
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,460
is worth the price.

660
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,420
As the Demon King,

661
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,660
no one wants to relieve the suffering of my people more than I do.

662
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,860
But it shouldn't

663
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,580
be based on other people's suffering.

664
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,340
No.

665
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,300
You're wrong.

666
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,860
As long as our people are no longer in pain,

667
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,380
then

668
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,380
any sacrifice

669
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,770
is worth it,

670
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,580
including my life

671
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,780
and

672
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,300
your life.

673
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,020
But did those sacrifices

674
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,340
get you what you wanted?

675
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,620
Or was it for a greater sacrifice of our people?

676
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,020
If Immortal Luo Ge get angry,

677
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,900
It will be a slaughter inside this palace.

678
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
How can we stop him if that happens?

679
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:00,980
Fine.

680
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,820
Since you think what I did was wrong,

681
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,540
I'll take the responsibility.

682
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,100
I do not judge the right or wrong of what you do.

683
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,980
Fu,

684
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,930
you've suffered so much.

685
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,540
It's me who failed to protect you.

686
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,100
Madam,

687
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,940
do you remember

688
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,340
he told me...

689
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,930
I said

690
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,890
that lifetime is long.

691
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,020
What if I can't afford you?

692
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,060
He said to me,

693
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,450
I'll sell myself to you.

694
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,500
I'll sell myself to you

695
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,300
-for one tael of silver. -One tael of silver.

696
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,620
-Okay? -Okay?

697
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,980
One tael of silver.
