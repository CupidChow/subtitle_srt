Mother of Trees,

5
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,660
do you remember

6
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,060
what he said to me?

7
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,660
I said

8
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,420
life is long.

9
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,740
What if I can't afford you?

10
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,740
He said.

11
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,220
-Then I'll sell myself to you. -Then I'll sell myself to you.

12

-One tael. -One tael.

13

-Okay? -Okay?

14

One tael.

15
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,380
I wanted to cry when I heard it.

16
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,980
Too expensive?

17
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,660
How about

18
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,100
one copper coin?

19
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,700
He is such a calculating person.

20
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,980
He wanted to do it for one copper coin.

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,660
♫In the sea of clouds, I looked at the reflection of the moon in the water♫

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,579
Then,

23
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,700
I gave him one copper coin.

24

♫I kept waiting and arched my palms into a circle♫

25

26
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,980
He promised me for a lifetime.

27
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,180
One copper coin.

28

♫The reflection gradually reminded me of our first meeting♫

29

31
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,460

you should ask yourself.

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,900
to go back to Immortal Palace with me

174
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,100
and cultivate.

175
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,220
I think she's doing well now.

176
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,740
She is passionate.

177
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,900
That's who she is.

178
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,220
Why bother to change it?

179
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,780
Exactly.

180
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,650
Are you looking for me?

181
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
Is there any news about the Lusitai Incident?

182
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,180
Yes.

183
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,300
Please tell me.

184
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,340
It was...

185
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,020
It was done by a heresy of the Demons,

186
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,900
half-demon Lu Sheng.

187
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,460
Fu.

188
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,180
Fu.

189
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,740
I'm Fu of the Aquatic Demons.

190
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,210
Greetings, Immortal Luo Ge.

191
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,700
Half-demon Lu Sheng?

192
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,580
Yes.

193
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,260
Immortal Luo Ge

194
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,100
must be familiar with this name.

195
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,900
Half-demon Lu Sheng

196
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,260
is half-demon and half-human.

197
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,580
He is good at the formation

198
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,340
and loves collecting magic tools.

199
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,900
He's a loyal subordinate of the God of the Moonlight.

200
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,980
During the battle between the two gods,

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,100
half heart of the God of the Moonlight

202
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,330
was suppressed under the Four Seasons Monument.

203
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,340
Lu Sheng

204
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
is the one and only

205
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
who wants to topple the Four Seasons Monument most

206
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,020
in the world.

207
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,500
Did he

208
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,460
give the string to you?

209
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,090
Bone-Corroding Harp was broken that day,

210
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,380
and it infuriated the Immortal Palace.

211
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,220
They forced the Aquatic Demons to repair it within three days.

212
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
I had no choice

213
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
but went to Lu Sheng.

214
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,020
He gave me the string.

215
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,180
And I

216
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,860
gave the string

217
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,570
to the Demon King.

218
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,460
But this has nothing to do with him.

219
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,060
It's all my fault.

220
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,700
If you don't believe me,

221
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,580
you can check Lu Sheng's residence.

222
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,060
You have performed a Protection Spell here.

223
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,820
We can't escape.

224
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,340
Where is Lu Sheng now?

225
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,580
She knows.

226
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,860
Lu Sheng is Lu Li's master.

227
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,140
She knows him.

228
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,100
It's more comfortable to sleep at He Na's place.

229
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,860
Immortal Luo Ge.

230
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,220
Why are you here?

231
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,060
Aren't you waiting for He Na to find out the truth?

232
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,580
After you take me to find someone,

233
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,770
maybe the truth will come out.

234
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,700
Immortal, your face...

235
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,570
What happened?

236
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,820
A dog bit me.

237
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,020
What kind of dog

238
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,090
is so gentle and left such few marks?

239
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,500
You'd better learn the Dog-Beating Stick from the human.

240
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,500
Maybe

241
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,580
it can protect your fair face.

242
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,940
Liu Shao.

243
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,460
I wonder if your head

244
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,800
can take my Dog-Beating Stick?

245
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,300
You are not him.

246
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,260
You bastard.

247
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,500
Immortal.

248
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,180
Yesterday, I...

249
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,930
Shut up.

250
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,340
One more word,

251
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
I'll make you can't talk for three days.

252
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,740
The things were exposed.

253
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,020
Luo Ge will be here soon.

254
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,220
You can use this magic weapon

255
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,780
to make Luo Ge lose his power temporarily.

256
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,740
Take this chance to kill Liu Shao.

257
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,450
You can imprison Luo Ge here.

258
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,060
I have a way to persuade him

259
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,860
to split the Four Seasons Monument

260
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,660
and become

261
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,380
the real God of the Moonlight.

262
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,900
What are you writing?

263
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,860
Over the wastelands,

264
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,180
there is an oasis in the northwest.

265
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,540
The person living there

266
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,460
is an elder of our race.

267
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,140
Take this letter to him.

268
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,020
Luo Ge set a Protection Spell here.

269
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,540
I will work with all my people

270
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,660
to break the Protection Spell

271
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,660
and send you away.

272
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,060
You don't trust me?

273
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,580
Fu,

274
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,780
We've grown up together.

275
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,820
No one knows you better than me.

276
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,500
The incident of Luositai

277
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,020
must have something to do with you.

278
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,340
You trapped me last night

279
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,180
because you wanted to find Luo Ge

280
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,020
and admit that the spirit vein is yours

281
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,610
and take everything I did,

282
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,500
right?

283
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,020
You have to leave now.

284
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,100
Answer me.

285
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,780
You are arrogant

286
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,980
because you have been trapped in the water.

287
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,020
I don't blame you for doing this

288
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,500
because you feel unfair in your heart.

289
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,620
But Fu,

290
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,060
most of the dead are innocent.

291
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,420
Someone has to take the blame.

292
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,180
I'm the Demon King

293
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,820
and your brother.

294
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,619
This is what I should do.

295
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,970
So do you think

296
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,740
you are really doing this for me?

297
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,530
This is the only thing I can do for you.

298
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
But that's not what I want you to do.

299
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,060
Fu,

300
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,740
What did you put in the tea?

301
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,020
Debilitating Powder.

302
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,300
The most common drug in the demon world.

303
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,860
Brother.

304
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,420
Let me tell you

305
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,740
what I really want you

306
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,460
to do for me.

307
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,820
Brahma Lotus.

308
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,420
This is really a top-class magic weapon.

309
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,460
It is made with the Demon Palace's tens of thousands of years of history.

310
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,060
It is really amazing.

311
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,900
Brother,

312
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,690
did you sleep well?

313
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,700
What exactly do you want?

314
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,940
Do you want to be the Demon King?

315
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,140
If I really want to be the Demon King,

316
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,020
would you give it to me?

317
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,060
If you really want it,

318
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,860
I can give it to you.

319
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,340
Demon King in White.

320
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,140
His race is cursed.

321
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,820
They can't leave the water

322
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,620
and be restricted everywhere.

323
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,820
And they have to lower their heads to others.

324
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,180
Why do I want

325
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,300
such a title?

326
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,460
What exactly do you want?

327
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,300
I want my brother to come back.

328
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,740
I'll do anything for that.

329
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,660
Lu Li planted this for me.

330
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,540
It's very sweet.

331
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,780
Mr. Lu Sheng.

332
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,140
Do you remember Lu Li planted the pear tree for you?

333
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,700
But he's not the first person

334
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,940
to plant the pear tree for me.

335
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,580
I'm a half-demon.

336
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,980
Both humans and demons hate me.

337
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,100
A long time ago,

338
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,580
I was exiled to an extremely cold place.

339
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,380
I was infected with lung disease.

340
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,780
One day,

341
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,700
an amazing person came

342
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,180
and adopted me.

343
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,020
Because I have a cough,

344
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,900
he planted a pear tree for me.

345
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,420
Every year,

346
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,180
he picked the first pear for me.

347
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,980
Who said you can't practice magic?

348
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,940
You are not useless.

349
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,300
From now on,

350
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,410
I will teach you the formation.

351
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,900
After you master it,

352
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,660
you can use the formation

353
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,700
to teach those who bullied you a lesson.

354
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,860
The one who gave you pears

355
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,580
is the God of the Moonlight?

356
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,780
Yes.

357
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,900
So you want the God of the Moonlight to come back,

358
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,660
as well as the half of the heart?

359
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,180
But you know

360
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,500
what's inside that half of the heart.

361
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,980
If it reappears,

362
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,060
the three worlds will be in misery.

363
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,940
What does it have to do with me?

364
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,220
All I did in my life

365
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,380
is for the God of the Moonlight.

366
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,820
I don't understand.

367
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,620
Why did you set him up?

368
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,010
Why did you kill him?

369
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,580
Lu Li got killed because of you.

370
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
You made him lose his mind.

371
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,340
Now,

372
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,460
you're here to hurt him.

373
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,060
You are his destined enemy.

374
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,300
I won't let you go.

375
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,900
Luo Ge.

376
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,170
This magic weapon can trap Luo Ge.

377
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,980
Now it's time to kill Liu Shao.

378
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,850
No.

379
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,700
Someone tampered with the formation.

380
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,740
Lu Sheng.

381
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,620
This is not the Immortal Trapping Formation.

382
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,930
This is the Immortal Devouring Formation.

383
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,860
This formation

384
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,020
will kill everyone around

385
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,500
no matter if you are a human or an immortal.

386
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,460
We will all die under this formation.

387
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,210
Even you can't escape.

388
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,900
It's Fu.

389
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,620
Fu tampered with the Brahma Lotus.

390
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,300
Luo Ge has the strongest spiritual power.

391
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,770
So the first one to be devoured by the Immortal Devouring Formation

392
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:15,860
is him.

393
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,900
Oh no.

394
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,420
Luo Ge!

395
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,620
You can't die.

396
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,090
She activates the Sun Spirit to attract the Immortal Devouring Formation.

397
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,060
Why?

398
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,940
Why did she do that?

399
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,380
Why do I feel heartbroken?

400
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,340
I can't let Liu Shao die for me.

401
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,620
Moon Sword!

402
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,100
No!

403
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,500
Don't use your vitality.

404
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,580
A large amount of spiritual power will release

405
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,410
and you will die for sure.

406
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,060
If you die,

407
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,060
who else can I find

408
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,620
to be the God of the Moonlight in this world?

409
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,980
In this world,

410
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,780
only the God of the Moonlight and Li

411
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,540
would plant the pear tree and make pear soup for me.

412
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,100
But I sacrificed Li's life

413
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,340
and failed to save the God of the Moonlight.

414
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,860
It seems

415
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,060
I can't wait for you to come back.

416
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,660
But at least

417
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,100
I can still protect half of the God's heart.

418
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,260
Lu Sheng,

419
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,420
if you master the formations and spells I taught you,

420
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,220
I hope you can get rid of the restriction of your half-demon identity

421
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,860
and live

422
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,140
your life.

423
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,500
Unfortunately,

424
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,980
I don't have that chance.

425
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,500
Don't waste your spiritual power.

426
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,620
It's useless.

427
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,740
I have only one obsession

428
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,460
in my life.

429
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,020
That is to bring the God back.

430
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,130
Because of it,

431
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,540
I adopted Lu Li.

432
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,380
Master, I'm back.

433
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,820
Master.

434
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,890
I'll make you Chuanbei herb-pear juice.

435
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,340
It's sweet.

436
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,340
I'm sure you'll like it.

437
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,140
In this way,

438
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,580
I can find the best doctor in the world

439
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,580
and buy the best and most expensive medicine for you.

440
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,450
Master,

441
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,780
you are ill.

442
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,260
Take care of yourself.

443
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,780
You can live your own life

444
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,180
and love the one you love.

445
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,300
You

446
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,500
don't seem to want me to be with her.

447
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,500
You can't be together.

448
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,380
You want to know your identity,

449
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,740
so I asked you to come to the  Mansion of Wu Yang Duke

450
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,980
to pull out the Moon Sword,

451
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,820
not to enjoy the romance.

452
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,900
Master,

453
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,500
if I become the God of the Moonlight,

454
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,740
Liu Shao will die.

455
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,220
You want to sacrifice an innocent person.

456
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,260
Why don't you start with me?

457
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,140
Fine.

458
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,540
Give me back half of your heart.

459
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,780
Do you really want to die for her?

460
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,740
You value this half of the heart so much.

461
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,940
It's full of Liu Shao

462
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,500
Master,

463
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,820
remember to take your medicine on time.

464
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,940
Take care.

465
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,770
Lu Li.

466
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,580
It's my obsession that killed you.

467
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,740
I'm sorry.

468
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,380
Be careful of Fu.

469
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:08,670
[Half-demon Lu Sheng]

470
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,380
[Half-demon Lu Sheng]

471
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,260
Why did you save me?

472
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,220
Don't think too much.

473
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,060
Immortals are merciful.

474
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,300
No matter who is in danger,

475
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,570
I will save them.

476
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,300
And you are one of the living.

477
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,900
I can't

478
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,460
let you die.

479
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,020
What is this?

480
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,180
The Tears of the Half-Demon Lu Sheng just shed.

481
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,130
[Half-demon Lu Sheng's Tomb]

482
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,050
What I want is

483
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,220
the ambitious you 900 years ago.

484
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,180
You were gentle

485
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,420
but full of ambition.

486
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,380
You can leave the water.

487
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,140
You can be free.

488
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,940
You become like this

489
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,020
because of me.

490
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,940
Fu,

491
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,780
you are right.

492
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,340
I was too arrogant when I was young.

493
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,780
I just practiced the flute here.

494
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,450
What does it have to do with you?

495
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,540
Cut the crap.

496
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,380
Nothing good will happen

497
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,450
when the Aquatic Demons came to the Human world.

498
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,620
How dare you resist, you demon?

499
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,700
A man should have dignity and not kneel.

500
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,340
It seems that the Immortal Palace

501
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,580
regards dignity as garbage.

502
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
My brother

503
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,100
was the pride of the Aquatic Demons.

504
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,540
The people who had been bullied, including me,

505
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,700
saw the hope of the Aquatic Demons in you.

506
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,020
Back then...

507
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,370
it was my fault.

508
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,620
I was too impulsive

509
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,660
and got everyone into trouble.

510
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,500
Brother.

511
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,300
Fu.

512
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,740
You're finally back.

513
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,020
Demon King.

514
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
What do you want?

515
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,300
How dare you Aquatic Demons

516
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,580
insult the people from the Immortal Palace?

517
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,780
What do you think I want?

518
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,500
He insulted me.

519
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,380
I didn't hurt him.

520
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,300
Let go of Fu!

521
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,340
Don't hurt my brother!

522
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,820
I think you won't regret it until you see the result.

523
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,100
Do you want to know how your people died?

524
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,340
My Pearl of Fire

525
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,860
can absorb the water in the body.

526
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,260
Let me show you.

527
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,460
Brother.

528
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:46,980
Don't worry about me.

529
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Kill them!

530
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,260
Kill them all!

531
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,860
You have guts.

532
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,700
I admire you.

533
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,420
Open his mouth.

534
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,020
Let him swallow it.

535
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,500
No!

536
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,500
What did you say?

537
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,780
Please don't.

538
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,180
You're begging me now.

539
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,140
But I remember

540
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,860
you were mocking us immortals.

541
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,060
You said we don't have dignity

542
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,100
and kneel.

543
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,980
Brother.

544
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,060
Don't.

545
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,210
Don't!

546
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,890
No.

547
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,900
Can you let Fu go?

548
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,020
Yes.

549
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,740
As long as you

550
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
swallow it,

551
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,780
I'll let him go.

552
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:14,659
No.

553
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,409
No!

554
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,300
No!

555
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,780
No!

556
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,139
Brother!

557
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,580
Demon King!

558
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,340
Brother!

559
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,020
Brother!

560
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:46,889
Brother!

561
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,420
Brother.

562
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,940
He Na.

563
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,340
You're a rare genius

564
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,820
with amazing magic,

565
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,540
and you can leave the water,

566
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,140
but what's the use?

567
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,260
Look at your brother.

568
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,410
Can he leave here?

569
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,620
Can the Aquatic Demons

570
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,620
leave here?

571
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,660
How dare you

572
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,300
disrespect the world

573
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,020
and fight against us immortals?

574
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,340
Stay here

575
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,140
and be an inferior race.

576
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,180
Brother.

577
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,980
Brother!

578
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,340
They said we are an inferior race.

579
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,260
They said you are not qualified to be proud.

580
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,740
They said you're not qualified to challenge the Immortal Palace.

581
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,060
But do you really admit it?

582
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,260
The Pearl of Fire you swallowed

583
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,060
had hurt you for ten years.

584
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,300
Have you forgotten?

585
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,580
Even if you have forgotten,

586
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,530
I remember everything.

587
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,260
I remember his name is Xie Lingqi.

588
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,700
He was frustrated in the Immortal Palace

589
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,340
and he dared to come to the Aquatic Demons to mess around.

590
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,020
I caught him with Lu Sheng

591
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,300
and threatened him.

592
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,930
You are...

593
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,940
It's you.

594
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,580
It's been 900 years.

595
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,220
Practitioner Xie.

596
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,500
How are you?

597
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,540
It's useless.

598
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,460
Do you know who taught Lu Sheng

599
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,060
the formations?

600
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,940
It's the God of the Moonlight.

601
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,980
When you forced my brother,

602
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,020
have you ever thought about today?

603
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,060
Fine.

604
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,380
I was wrong.

605
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,900
I was wrong.

606
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:11,900
Let me go.

607
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,260
Don't kill me.

608
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,300
You're a practitioner from the Immortal Palace.

609
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,060
How can you beg for mercy from an inferior person?

610
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,980
Listen to me.

611
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,980
I can't die.

612
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,540
I can't die yet.

613
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,170
I haven't got what I want yet.

614
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,100
Someone is waiting for me.

615
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,500
What you want.

616
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,700
Lord Wuxiang of the Immortal Palace

617
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,580
would be promoted to an Immortal probably.

618
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,100
Immortal Master Wanwu will be promoted too.

619
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,330
Can you get

620
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,410
what you want in your life?

621
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:50,930
How about this?

622
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,300
Let's work together.

623
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,780
Help me do what I want,

624
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,940
and I'll get what you want.

625
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,460
What do you think?

626
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,180
He agreed to cooperate with me.

627
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,100
Later,

628
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,700
Luo Ge set a trap for him.

629
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,060
I forced him to jump in.

630
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,580
I gave him demon energy.

631
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,380
This is for you. It's demon energy.

632
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,420
You know what to do.

633
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,180
I used the Water Hyacinth Spell

634
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,620
to get his demon aura into his bones

635
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,060
and make everyone of the Immortal Palace

636
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,940
think he was a spy of the demon world.

637
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,220
He couldn't defend himself

638
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,620
and was thrown into the Bone-melting Pool.

639
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,060
Brother,

640
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,100
I get avenge for you.

641
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,420
Stop thinking about the past

642
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,420
and be free again.

643
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,740
Fu,

644
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,820
from the day I became the Demon King,

645
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,500
I have no freedom.

646
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,930
I want to give it back to you.

647
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,860
I did these

648
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,580
cruel things,

649
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,650
not for the title of Demon King.

650
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,650
You are my brother.

651
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,580
You knelt for me

652
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
and swallowed the Pearl of Fire for me.

653
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,660
I would do anything.

654
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,060
I want to topple the Four Seasons Monument

655
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
and overthrow the world.

656
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,460
I want to give you freedom.

657
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,860
But if we can find the immortal energy of Immortal Ze Shui,

658
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,900
we can also save our people.

659
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,380
You don't have to sacrifice so many lives.

660
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,900
Enough.

661
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,740
Because you know

662
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,900
it's useless.

663
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,580
Your Majesty,

664
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,540
Immortal Luo Ge and Miss Liu are back.

665
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,340
They want to see you and General Fu.

666
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,780
Luo Ge?

667
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:05,940
He's not dead.

668
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,410
There is no actual evidence

669
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,820
that it has something to do with Fu.

670
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,780
Then please tell me

671
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,820
which one of you Aquatic Demons let the news slip?

672
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,180
Is that you?

673
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,100
He Na.

674
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,100
The Immortal is just taking Fu back to imprison him temporarily.

675
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,820
It will be fine.

676
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,420
I'm the Demon King.

677
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,780
If I say no,

678
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,740
it's no.

679
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,700
Unfortunately,

680
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,580
in this small Aquatic Demons,

681
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,540
not everyone listens to the Demon King.

682
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,020
I'll go.
