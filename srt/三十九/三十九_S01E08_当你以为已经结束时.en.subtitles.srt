1
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,012
Hey.

2
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,015
Thanks.

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,975
I'll see you.

4
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,079
CLINICAL ACNEOLOGY

5
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,528
Mi-jo.

6
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,864
Sorry. I rushed over
without even taking off my makeup.

7
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,658
-Go study for your exam.
-Okay.

8
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,996
See you.

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,081
Go on.

10
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,548
-You?
-Oh, come on.

11
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,550
Is Ms. Park Jeong-ja's guardian here?

12
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,592
Yes.

13
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,303
Goodness, guys.

14
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,305
-Oh, right.
-It's me.

15
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,772
Those three care for her
a lot better than any husband would.

16
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,857
I know, right?

17
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,654
Mom.

18
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:03,016
WHEN YOU THINK IT'S THE END

19
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,605
EPISODE 8

20
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,121
Mom, let's keep this to ourselves.

21
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,041
Chan-young is sick,

22
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,752
and Joo-hee's having a hard time
because she quit her job.

23
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,589
Come whenever you want.

24
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,008
I will

25
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,719
tell you everything.

26
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,693
-My gosh.
-What's going on?

27
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,615
Did you drink?

28
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,992
Did you drive?

29
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,494
I can't sleep.

30
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,747
But you need to sleep.
You have work tomorrow.

31
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,666
Honey, get out of bed.

32
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,251
Come here.

33
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,421
Why did you guys even move out
if you were going to come so often?

34
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,131
Goodness.

35
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,886
Do you want some warm milk?

36
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,179
I'm sleepy.

37
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,917
Bye, Mom.

38
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,878
Stop wandering around

39
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,089
and just get some more sleep.

40
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,632
What? I'm going to work.

41
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,509
Mi-jo told me what happened.

42
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,470
And your acting is horrible, so just stop.

43
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,017
Mom, I'm looking

44
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,311
for a job at another--

45
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,438
Stop working at department stores.

46
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,233
You've worked long and hard enough
in that suffocating environment.

47
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,319
You can stop now.

48
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,236
Momâ€¦

49
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,491
Just take a break.

50
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,202
It's time you got married.

51
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,954
That's not easy.

52
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,751
At least send your profile
to a matchmaking agency.

53
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,844
Where's Dad?

54
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,928
He went golfing.

55
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,059
-Mom.
-Yes?

56
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,227
When you're pregnant with a baby,

57
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,480
do you bond with it?

58
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,398
Are you pregnant?

59
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,151
Of course not.

60
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,695
Then why are you even asking?

61
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,198
You know,

62
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,202
I was never inside your belly.

63
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,831
Does that mean the bond
between you and me is weaker than the one

64
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,958
between you and Mi-hyeon?

65
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,211
You're being strange.

66
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,714
It's not like you to ask such a question.

67
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,844
Mi-jo.

68
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,557
Although you never grew inside my belly,

69
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,060
I cared for you as if you did.

70
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,358
"I wonder if that kid will like me."

71
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,070
"I wonder if she'll like this house."

72
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,282
"I wonder what she's thinking.
She's so full of laughter."

73
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,368
"She must be in a good mood."

74
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,371
"I want her to always be happy."

75
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,957
"I wonder what makes her smile."

76
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,754
I checked on you
and thought about you, day and night.

77
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,966
That's pretty much the same thing.

78
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,177
Whether or not I was pregnant with you
doesn't really matter.

79
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,181
What is it?

80
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,642
Is something wrong?

81
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,395
No.

82
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,692
Ever since

83
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,194
I was little,

84
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,072
I've loved it when people said

85
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,450
that I take after you.

86
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,244
It put me at ease

87
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,955
because it meant that I actually do

88
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,833
look like your daughter.

89
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm starting to feel upset.

90
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,796
You don't just look like it.
You are my daughter.

91
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,133
You know that's not what I meant.

92
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,969
I'm serious right now.

93
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,140
I also have something to tell you.

94
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,017
What?

95
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,186
To be honest,

96
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,897
if I gave birth to you,

97
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,816
you wouldn't have come out
looking so pretty.

98
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,612
Look at your sister.
You know what I mean, right?

99
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,781
I can't believe you!

100
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,912
Don't tell Mi-hyeon.

101
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,872
She's very sensitive about her looks.

102
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,457
My goodness.

103
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,628
Come to think of it,

104
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,673
what am I going to wear to work?
I have a patient in the morning.

105
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,092
You can wear Mi-hyeon's clothes. Hold on.

106
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,862
Do you think this is okay?

107
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,073
-Hello.
-Hello.

108
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,283
Hey. What?

109
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,577
These are her clothes.

110
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,915
Why are you wearing my clothes?

111
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,625
Those sneakers are mine too.

112
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,296
SO-WON

113
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,676
Have a good one.

114
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,010
-You too.
-You too.

115
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,187
Hey.

116
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,439
Seon-u, were you busy during the weekend?

117
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,899
I had to attend a wedding.

118
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,942
When should we eat?

119
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,529
I'm busy with work.
I'll go once things are settled.

120
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,406
-Okay.
-Bye.

121
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,080
I want you to apologize to So-won.

122
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,083
Apologize? For what?

123
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,043
I just let her live her life.

124
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,754
She agreed to it,
which is why she accepted it.

125
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,339
You coerced her.

126
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,385
It's not like I blackmailed her
or threatened her with a knife.

127
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,098
So-won is unbelievable.

128
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,184
What's the point of returning
this money after all this time?

129
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,187
I could tell by the look in her eyes
as she grew up

130
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,565
-that she was really something.
-Father.

131
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,734
She insisted on leaving.

132
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,653
I only asked her to sign
the inheritance disclaimer,

133
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,656
but she got upset
and wanted to disown the family.

134
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,284
-I don't owe her an apology.
-You adopted her,

135
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,495
which means she's our family
and has the right to everything.

136
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,997
Are you insane?

137
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,709
Why would I give my hard-earned money
to an adopted child?

138
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,794
Do you really mean that?

139
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,840
It's time you stopped
hanging around with orphans.

140
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,966
I got rid of one,

141
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,093
but you're dating another orphan here?

142
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,726
Come back to the States with me
so your Green Card won't be taken away.

143
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,519
Don't even think about coming back.

144
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,063
Find a job in the States.

145
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,829
Why are you standing there?

146
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,833
Even if your hair looks nice,
it's obvious you slept out.

147
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,086
At least my hair will look nice.

148
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,673
What kind of woman who's about to turn 40

149
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,634
goes to her parent's house to sleep out?

150
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,136
Couldn't you go somewhere better?

151
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,430
Like where?

152
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,141
For example,

153
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,310
Kim Seon-u's place.

154
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,526
Do I look weird?

155
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,320
It's nice. You look like a quack.

156
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,614
How about I just wear only my bra inside?

157
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,950
Good idea. Way to look insane.

158
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,702
How could you leave only
a sweatsuit at our parents' house?

159
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,414
Why would I want to look nice there?

160
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,998
It's all about comfort.

161
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,251
And you're one to talk.

162
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,462
You never leave anything there.
What are you, a stranger?

163
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,715
Don't say that. A stranger?

164
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,884
Are you trying to say
I'm not your real family?

165
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,430
I haven't seen you like this in a while.

166
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,475
Okay, fine. Don't be upset.

167
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,105
Mi-jo, you're my beloved,
one and only sister

168
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,108
who means so much to me.

169
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:19,071
But stop acting up.
It really pisses me off, okay?

170
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,326
This is a semi-basement,
but you still get a lot of sunlight.

171
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,412
It's really spacious too.

172
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,332
And it's impossible
to find a place like this at this price.

173
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,628
The landlord is very kind,
so tenants end up staying for a long time.

174
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,754
I see.

175
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,466
Didn't you also stay here
for quite a while?

176
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,259
-Oh, yes.
-Right.

177
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,053
Where are you moving to? Nearby?

178
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,555
No.

179
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,559
I see. If you're done looking around,
you can check out the extra space.

180
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,977
-Sure.
-Okay.

181
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,615
Hello?

182
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:04,950
Yes.

183
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,330
Oh, really?

184
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,875
Sure.

185
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,127
Okay. Thank you.

186
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,295
Thank you.

187
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,511
I'm so excited.

188
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,688
I'll get out here.

189
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,733
How much is it?

190
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,943
It's 6,000 won.

191
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,375
Miss?

192
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961
Yes, here you go.

193
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,969
Come in.

194
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,264
Hey.

195
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,683
You didn't eat, did you?

196
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,560
No. You?

197
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,936
Me neither.

198
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,062
Let's drink this.

199
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,274
Thanks.

200
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,408
Thank you for this.

201
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,746
Is something up with So-won?

202
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,957
No.

203
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,003
It seemed like you went for a run.
You even skipped lunch.

204
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,506
It's nice to get your attention.

205
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,509
Why didn't you eat?

206
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,805
Oh, you went home to get changed.

207
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:53,976
Come in.

208
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,147
Are you both on a diet?

209
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,609
She doesn't need to go on a diet.

210
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,236
How annoying.

211
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,909
Dr. Kim, you need to go to the States
because of your Green Card, right?

212
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,201
Yes, that's right.

213
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,705
I'll be back right away.
It won't take long, so don't worry.

214
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,957
Dr. Cha, when's the seminar?

215
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,709
Make sure the dates don't overlap.

216
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,254
You're going to the States?

217
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,839
Yes.

218
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,636
I was going to go in the summer,
but it turns out I need to go earlier.

219
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,679
It won't take long.

220
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,642
Also, my parentsâ€¦

221
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,353
In other words, her parents

222
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,564
would like to eat with you sometime.
Can you make time?

223
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,566
Why?

224
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,109
Why do you think?

225
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,445
Maybe to ask about you two,

226
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,906
to see if he's adjusting well
at work, and so on.

227
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,116
There could be many reasons.

228
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,039
Dr. Kim, is your father still in Seoul?

229
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,668
He doesn't come here often,
so why don't you ask him to join as well?

230
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,669
No.

231
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,345
I don't think it's the right time.

232
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,850
I guess you're right.

233
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,478
He doesn't come often, so I bet he's busy.

234
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,648
Then I guess you could just eat with us

235
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,316
when you have time.

236
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,484
That's all right.

237
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,113
You guys should get to work.

238
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,739
Let's go, Dr. Cha.

239
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,998
Have a good day.

240
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,708
Okay. Thanks for the drink.

241
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,686
You're all done.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?

242
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,521
Not as much as I thought it would.

243
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,524
Wait here. It's time for your skin care.

244
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,483
Okay.

245
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,038
No.

246
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,582
I don't think it's the right time.

247
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,891
You should apply a lot of serum
after receiving laser treatment.

248
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,435
That feels nice.

249
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,519
It does, right?

250
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,397
You should apply it regularly.

251
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,356
Okay.

252
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,995
Hey.

253
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,998
I'm working.

254
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,376
Really?

255
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,337
You really got it?

256
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,427
Hello?

257
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,555
Seriously?

258
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,850
I'm so happy for you!

259
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,395
I knew you'd make it.

260
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,899
This calls for a party.

261
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,734
What time?

262
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,028
But my part-time job--

263
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,738
We're going to close early today.

264
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:36,990
What? Why?

265
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,575
I have plans.

266
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,663
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

267
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,747
Bye.

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,794
Are you closing early for me?

269
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,421
No.

270
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,591
I have important plans tonight.

271
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,475
CONGRATULATIONS,
ACTRESS JEONG CHAN-YOUNG

272
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,981
My gosh. I can't believe this.

273
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,191
I'm so excited for you.

274
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,319
Who's playing the male protagonist?

275
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,573
That's all you're interested in, isn't it?

276
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,159
By the way, why isn't Jin-seok here yet?

277
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,245
He's going to be late.
One of his actors caused trouble.

278
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,205
He should be focusing on you.

279
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,001
I don't belong to his agency.
He doesn't need to worry about me.

280
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,503
Why didn't you bring Seon-u?

281
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,717
What's going on? I smell something fishy.

282
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,093
Did you fight with him?

283
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,387
Why would we fight? We're not kids.

284
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,432
I think Hyeon-jun and Hye-jin
are the ones who had a fight.

285
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,518
He seemed down all day,
so I walked on eggshells.

286
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,936
Why walk on eggshells?

287
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,397
You need to stay alert.

288
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,774
This is your time to attack.

289
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,943
Gosh, it's really not.

290
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,325
Speed things up, you two.
At least one of you should get married.

291
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,037
Even if you fix a date today,
I might not make it to your wedding.

292
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,915
I swear I'll rip that mouth of yours.

293
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,666
I'm holding a knife.

294
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,546
Think before you speak.
What's the matter with you?

295
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,007
My gosh, seriously.

296
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,634
He's here!

297
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,391
What is that? You're so sweet, Jin-seok.

298
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,186
Why are you so surprised?
I'm always sweet.

299
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:34,983
Sorry I'm late.

300
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,488
Flowers? This is so childish.

301
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,993
It took me a while to pick ones
that aren't as pretty as you.

302
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,829
I think I'm going to puke.

303
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,997
I feel sick.

304
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,250
They're really jealous.

305
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,584
Should I make it worse?

306
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,255
MOM

307
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,932
Hey, Mom.

308
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,269
Right now? I'm home.

309
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,939
What? Now?

310
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,609
Why do you want the girlsâ€¦

311
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,820
Mom. Hello?

312
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,326
-What is it?
-She wants me to come over.

313
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,328
With you guys.

314
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,665
CHAN-YOUNG'S MOM

315
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,208
Your mom's calling me too.

316
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,461
Answer it.

317
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,465
Hey, Mom.

318
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,969
I'm actually busy right nowâ€¦

319
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,596
Right now?

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,806
She wants you to come?

321
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,226
Is something wrong?

322
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,311
Hello?

323
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,944
CHAN-YOUNG'S MOM

324
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,617
Hey, Mom.

325
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,870
Yes, I've been well.

326
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,122
Yes.

327
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,791
Okay, bye.

328
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,593
I wonder what's up.

329
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,303
Does she want to see me too?

330
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,640
I think she knows.

331
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,685
That you're sick.

332
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,240
Chan-young, get up. I'll drive you there.

333
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,453
No, I think it's best that you stay here.

334
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,955
I'll find out what's up.

335
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,376
-Let's go.
-Okay.

336
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,426
So your conclusion is to break up with me?

337
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,804
What's wrong with you?

338
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,472
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,101
I wanted to be a good boyfriend,

340
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,977
but I guess I can't.

341
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,148
So your restaurant is
more important than me?

342
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,527
Being a hotel chef is more prestigious
and that's a fact.

343
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,653
Did what I said upset you?

344
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,699
I was angry when you said it,
but not anymore.

345
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,909
I understand.

346
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,410
Then why not do as I want?

347
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,081
Hye-jin.

348
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,208
I like things the way they are now.

349
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,295
It's just a small restaurant
in an ordinary neighborhood,

350
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,047
but it's better than the hotel.

351
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,633
What about your future?
Aren't you worried about that?

352
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,263
I think I'll prefer this

353
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,682
even when I get old.

354
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,684
I'm that happy now.

355
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,814
But if my happiness makes you feel uneasy,

356
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,442
-that's just sad.
-Hyeon-jun.

357
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,445
I just don't think
either of us is going to change.

358
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,991
I'm really sorry.

359
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:23,587
JEONG'S KITCHEN

360
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,725
I'll go inside by myself.

361
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,810
Now that I'm here,

362
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,271
it feels wrong to drag you into this.

363
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,025
Your mom asked us to come.
We should go too.

364
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,153
Chan-young, don't cry.
It's going to break her heart.

365
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,071
Okay.

366
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,172
Mom.

367
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,010
Dad.

368
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,765
Honey. Wait.

369
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,684
-Chan-young, how could you?
-Mom, what's wrong?

370
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,020
-Come here!
-Honey, put that down!

371
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,647
-What's with you?
-Calm down!

372
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,982
I was going to tell you everything!

373
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,360
-You!
-Wait.

374
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,945
-Come here.
-Mom, wait.

375
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,738
-Wait.
-Calm down.

376
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,114
You two are no different.

377
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,701
How could you all make a fool out of me?

378
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,703
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,332
I'm sorry, Mom. But calm down first--

380
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,042
Mi-jo, you should've known better.

381
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,296
Joo-hee, you're too soft,
so let's say I understand.

382
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,758
But Mi-jo, you're a smart girl.
You should've stopped her.

383
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,884
You're her friends!

384
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,928
Don't take it out on them.

385
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,099
Mom, why are you so angry?

386
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,852
It's nothing to bawl over,
but I didn't expect you'd react like this.

387
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,646
-Shut your mouth!
-Stop.

388
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,690
I never raised you to be like that.

389
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,277
I trusted you and waited even though
you went around trying to be an actress.

390
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,736
How could you live like that?

391
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,613
Do you take me for a fool?

392
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,620
Honey, come on. Let's sit down.

393
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,706
Have a conversation. Talk to her.

394
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,457
Talk to her about what?

395
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,669
We didn't think it was our place
to step in and tell you.

396
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,714
Chan-young wasn't ready yet.

397
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,924
She wasn't ready for what?

398
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,467
Oh, I see.

399
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,139
Did she need to get ready
to have an affair?

400
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,019
Mom, what exactly is this about?

401
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,645
Why are you angry?

402
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,316
Why in the world
would you date a married man?

403
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,651
You deserve more than that!

404
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,656
Mi-jo. Joo-hee.

405
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,993
You two should've stopped her!

406
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,370
But you teamed up with her and fooled me!

407
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,581
I had no idea and treated him likeâ€¦

408
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,586
I can't believe you three
just sat there and laughed along.

409
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,921
How could you guys do this to me?

410
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,840
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,843
I don't know what to say.

412
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,261
I'm sorry.

413
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,766
No! I never want to see you again!
You give me the creeps!

414
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,269
How could you make
a complete fool out of me?

415
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,731
I had no idea he was married,
so I treated him likeâ€¦

416
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,860
Don't ever call me Mom again!

417
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,113
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,618
We should've known better, Mom.

419
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,079
Mi-jo and Joo-hee did nothing wrong.

420
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,248
-Chan-young.
-You know what?

421
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,086
I shouldn't blame you two
when my daughter is the worst.

422
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,879
Chan-young, you move back in here.

423
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,924
As for you two,
I never want to see you again! Understood?

424
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,801
Mom, don't.

425
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,805
Honey, she's right. They're all grown up.

426
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,515
Let's hear them out first andâ€¦

427
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,810
What an amazing friendship you have.

428
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,312
Iâ€¦

429
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,565
I like him a lot.

430
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,405
He's about to get a divorce.

431
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,448
That's why I didn't tell you.

432
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,954
What? A divorce?

433
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,831
Goodness.

434
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,874
You fool!

435
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,294
His wife came to see me!

436
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,590
She's not even
thinking about getting a divorce.

437
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,635
You're having an affair!

438
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,013
You're her friends!
You should've stopped her!

439
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,726
Did you celebrate when he said
he was going to get a divorce?

440
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,728
They tried to stop me.

441
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,105
They tried to stop me dozens of times.

442
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,066
Then why did the three of you
fool me that day?

443
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,489
Mom.

444
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,119
That day, I wasâ€¦

445
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,412
It was becauseâ€¦

446
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,628
Mom, I'mâ€¦

447
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,801
I'mâ€¦

448
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,562
I'm terminally ill.

449
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,206
Honeyâ€¦

450
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,961
Honey, whatâ€¦

451
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,966
What is she saying?

452
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,760
Whatâ€¦

453
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,096
What did you just say?

454
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,892
I'm sorry.

455
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,733
Chan-young. Youâ€¦

456
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,403
You're what?

457
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,200
I have advanced pancreatic cancer.

458
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,371
I don't have much time left.

459
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,667
Mom!

460
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,626
-Mom!
-Honey!

461
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,544
Mom!

462
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,379
-Mom! Goodness!
-Mom.

463
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,339
Mom, wake up.

464
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,007
Wake up.

465
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:48,137
JEONG'S KITCHEN

466
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,309
Do you think she'll be okay?

467
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,187
I bet she's so shocked.

468
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:03,111
Maybe we should've told them sooner.

469
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,238
I know, right?

470
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,157
We should've come to tell them

471
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,869
even if Chan-young stopped us.

472
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,083
This is all new to us,

473
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,711
so we don't know what to do.

474
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,137
Chan-young's mom is being strong.

475
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,349
She's bearing it.

476
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,522
I'm starting to get scared, Mi-jo.

477
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,529
It feels like
things are progressing one by one.

478
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,699
It feels like

479
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,287
we're all getting ready
to say goodbye to Chan-young.

480
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,374
Will weâ€¦

481
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,629
be able to get through this?

482
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,561
The stars are

483
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,898
so pretty that it makes me sad.

484
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,988
How were we

485
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,033
when we were 29 years old?

486
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,411
I don't even remember.

487
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,082
How about when we were 19?

488
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,501
My mom was sick.

489
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:46,297
I remember when she was
diagnosed with colon cancer.

490
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,051
Right.

491
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,764
She was sick.

492
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,266
I knowâ€¦

493
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,231
who your biological mother is.

494
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,987
Come whenever you want.
I will tell you everything.

495
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,619
Joo-hee.

496
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,249
Can you hug me?

497
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,564
I'm sorry.

498
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,149
No, I'm sorry.

499
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,152
I had no idea you were sick.

500
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:57,368
I was too busy running my restaurant
to notice you were getting sick.

501
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,079
This isn't your fault, Mom.

502
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,125
Chan-young, why don't youâ€¦

503
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,962
I'm not going to get treatment.

504
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,340
I don't want to spend

505
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,927
the rest of my life in the hospital, Dad.

506
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,308
As if I'm not sickâ€¦

507
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,105
I want to live the rest of my life

508
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,900
as if I'm not sick,

509
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,111
and go when it's time.

510
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,249
Why don't you live here?
I want you to live with us.

511
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,586
Mom, I have some stuff
I need to take care of.

512
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,966
And there's something

513
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,428
I want to try while I still can.

514
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:02,058
Mi-jo and Joo-hee take such good care
of me that it gets annoying sometimes.

515
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,979
Jin-seok too.

516
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:15,988
All right.

517
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,865
Let'sâ€¦

518
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,202
take our time to think about it.

519
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,291
Sleep here tonight, at least.

520
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,920
You can do that, right?

521
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,190
They're pretty shook up, aren't they?

522
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,526
Yes, naturally.

523
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:55,945
How about you?

524
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,656
Are you okay?

525
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,075
My parents were
trying so hard to look okay.

526
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,370
That kind of broke my heart.

527
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,753
I'm going to sleep here tonight.
You guys can go back without me.

528
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,715
Didn't they ask you to move in with them?

529
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,593
They did.

530
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,471
But later.

531
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,724
I'll come later.

532
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,893
Okay.

533
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,853
Go on. It's late.

534
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,105
We could stay too, you know.

535
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,901
We should let her
spend time with her parents.

536
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,736
I'm sure she has a lot to say to them.

537
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,531
Okay.

538
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,534
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

539
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,300
Go on.

540
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,231
Let's call Chan-young tomorrow.

541
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,234
Okay. Drive safely.

542
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,568
You must be tired.

543
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,653
I'm okay.

544
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,615
Joo-hee.

545
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,200
Yes?

546
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,870
Make sure your mom takes her meds.

547
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,540
Why are you suddenly
concerned about my mom?

548
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,252
Let's be good to our parents.

549
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,296
Right. Let's.

550
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,715
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

551
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,768
-Bye.
-Bye.

552
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,677
Come whenever you want.

553
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,680
I will tell you everything.

554
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,599
No.

555
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,604
I don't think it's the right time.

556
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,243
Where is she?

557
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,768
Gosh.

558
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,904
This is driving me crazy.

559
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,793
We haven't done this in ages.

560
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:43,130
I normally ate lunch and dinner
with my friends or colleagues.

561
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,467
But I always had to eat breakfast alone.

562
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,514
It's always like this
with parents and children.

563
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,100
They fight like cats and dogs,

564
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,144
but all it takes is
a simple meal to reconcile.

565
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,605
Are you leaving tomorrow?

566
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,773
When will you be back?

567
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,150
It's time you came back.

568
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,445
You worked so hard to get a Green Card.
You don't belong here.

569
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,825
I'd also love for us
to have breakfast together

570
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,535
and meet more often.

571
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,289
Father.

572
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,625
-Yes?
-But at this rate,

573
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,961
that won't ever be possible.

574
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,882
So-won is my little sister.

575
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,009
She may not be your daughter,

576
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,970
but she's still my sister.

577
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,805
What's your point?

578
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,142
I get that you have no desire
to apologize to her.

579
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,060
But if you don't

580
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,856
apologize to So-won,

581
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,735
I'll have to cut ties with you.

582
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,366
Iâ€¦

583
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,412
worked so hard to raise you well,
and this is what I get in return?

584
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,496
I'm sorry, Father.

585
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,542
Why are you making
such a fuss for the orphan?

586
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,587
You may have used her
to get what you wanted,

587
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,506
but Mom and I welcomed her
into the family with love.

588
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,552
I'm the one who paid
for her education and college tuition.

589
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,097
You ruined her life because you didn't
want to share your money with her.

590
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,307
You littleâ€¦

591
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,814
Enjoy all that wealth on your own.

592
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,316
I don't want it either.

593
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,609
I paid for your--

594
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,236
I'll pay you back.

595
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,407
Also, Mi-jo is someone I love dearly.

596
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,828
Don't ever talk badly about her.
She's an amazing person.

597
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,750
Have a safe flight.

598
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,512
Your dad went and bought abalone.

599
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,848
I chopped them into small pieces
because you don't like them big.

600
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,143
It's going to be so smooth
that it'll just slide down your throat.

601
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,312
I prefer chewing on abalones.

602
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,024
See? I told you not to chop them
into small pieces.

603
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,153
I thought you didn't like
the texture of abalones.

604
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,364
My palate has changed.

605
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,492
I'll add bigger bites for lunch.

606
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,827
Again? I'm having porridge again?

607
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,456
It helps you absorb nutrients.
Just eat it.

608
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,959
I'm not sick enough to have porridge yet.

609
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,961
Later on, I'll have toâ€¦

610
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,426
Here. Eat this.

611
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,725
Pack me the rest for lunch.
I'll eat it at home.

612
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,270
-You're leaving already?
-Go tomorrow.

613
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,939
I have to take care of something.

614
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,649
I need to vacate the studio too.

615
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,025
There's a lot to do.

616
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,658
I'll come this weekend.

617
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,077
Your dad will pick you up.

618
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,453
I can come on my own.

619
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,330
Don't bother. I'll go pick you up.

620
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,213
Right, I always loved riding the truck.

621
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,053
But can you unload
the green onions this time?

622
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,763
I can't stand the smell.

623
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,057
Gosh, I'll have the truck cleaned.

624
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,183
-Get a new car.
-Okay.

625
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,353
-What?
-Get a new car.

626
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,938
Get a sedan.

627
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:28,939
Really?

628
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,816
Really? A sedan?

629
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,612
Then is it okay if I buy one today?

630
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,989
Get one that's available right away,
even if it's expensive.

631
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,657
This is unbelievable.

632
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,160
Are we really getting a sedan?

633
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,662
My gosh. Dad, do you remember?

634
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,373
We went to a department store
in our truck,

635
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,792
and the receptionist threw a fit

636
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,213
saying we weren't allowed
to park our truck in the parking lot.

637
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,467
Mom almost cussed at her
saying we were customers too.

638
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,303
"Almost"? She kind of did.

639
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,055
-That wench.
-Enough.

640
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,476
Eat your porridge. It's going to get cold.

641
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,561
I'm eating.

642
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,188
-Eat up.
-Here.

643
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,048
Sorry, we're not open yetâ€¦

644
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,426
I'm giving all your gifts back.

645
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,427
Throw out my gifts.

646
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,097
Have a good life.

647
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,314
Hands off.

648
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,578
Take it back.

649
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:10,916
No, thanks.

650
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,044
Take it while I'm being nice.

651
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,631
Or I'll start cussing at you and
you'll regret it like many others did.

652
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,968
What's it to you, old lady?

653
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,681
I'm not an old lady.

654
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,642
Anyway, just take it back.

655
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,020
It's better to end things amicably.
Or you'll regret it later.

656
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,690
Gosh, you're getting on my nerves.

657
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:40,070
I'm sure he put a lot of thought
into picking out these gifts for you.

658
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,489
Each gift shows how much he loved you.

659
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,867
You can't just
throw his gifts away like this

660
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,910
just because you can no longer see that.

661
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,871
You loved him too.

662
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,166
You should treat each other with respect.

663
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,254
If you want to throw it away,
do it yourself.

664
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,382
I'll kill you if you throw it away
in this neighborhood.

665
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,927
Who do you think you are?

666
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,723
Me?

667
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,310
I'm a part-timer at a Chinese restaurant.

668
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:24,948
Are you going somewhere?

669
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,534
So-won's coming,
and I wanted to invite you to lunch.

670
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:28,994
I have plans.

671
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,287
Oh, I see.

672
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,289
When are you going to the States?

673
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,958
Tell me your schedule in advance
so I can check mine.

674
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,668
I'm not going.

675
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,837
What about your Green Card?

676
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,548
I'm going to live here,
so I don't need it anymore.

677
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,055
Why are you being so capricious,

678
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,598
Mr. Kim?

679
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,105
You're returning right after lunch, right?
I'm going to be late.

680
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,542
Are you okay?

681
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,301
I told her that she should take it back,

682
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,554
and she agreed with me.

683
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,931
Hye-jin is a kind girl.

684
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:31,974
That's good.

685
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,896
Just go apologize to her
if you didn't mean what you said.

686
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,860
I was torn for a bit.

687
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,990
"Should I close the restaurant
and go back to the hotel

688
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,992
since it's what she wanted?"

689
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,291
But this could always happen again
even if I go back to being a hotel chef.

690
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,212
It's not her fault. We're just different.

691
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,926
How does the tea taste? It came in today.

692
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,387
-It's bitter.
-It's bitter?

693
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,639
Doesn't it smell nice?

694
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,532
Eat this too.

695
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,035
Okay, thanks. You should eat too.

696
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:50,969
Mom.

697
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,514
What took youâ€¦

698
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,352
so long to tell me the truth?

699
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,523
I just can't help but want to know that.

700
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,361
It must've eaten at you

701
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,322
since you first met me
when I was in high school.

702
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,450
Because you wereâ€¦

703
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,204
so beautiful and pure-hearted.

704
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,958
When you first came into my snack bar,

705
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:27,297
I couldn't believe how beautiful
and pure-hearted you were.

706
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,591
But when I heard you

707
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,345
talk about your biological mother,

708
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,893
my heart sank.

709
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,313
I never thought

710
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:49,069
that I'd get to see you grow up
for such a long time.

711
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,363
Fate can be so funny.

712
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:57,494
You could've just told me.

713
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,417
As time went by,
you became more beautiful.

714
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,546
You were always so radiant.

715
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,634
So I couldn'tâ€¦

716
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,558
I guess she's a disappointment.

717
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,602
My biological mother, I mean.

718
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,815
Do you want to know?

719
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,066
YEONGWOL PRISON
INMATE NUMBER 2382, LEE GYEONG-SUK

720
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,000
Seon-u, do you not eat breakfast?

721
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,418
I eat toast.

722
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,338
Then why do you look so famished?
Slow down a bit.

723
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,006
This is my first meal today.

724
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,801
Maybe it's because I feel better now.

725
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,012
I suddenly have an appetite.

726
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:42,766
Anyway, it takes me longer
to come here now.

727
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,560
Take that into consideration
next time we eat together.

728
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,604
I'll get you a small car.

729
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,857
No, it's okay. I rarely go anywhere.

730
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,110
No. Let's go check out some cars
since you're out here.

731
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,029
Pick one you like.

732
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:59,074
You don't owe me a car.
I'll buy it myself if I need one.

733
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,660
But you returned the money to Father.

734
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,577
You're broke.

735
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,708
Did the director tell you?

736
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,961
I'm the one who delivered the money.

737
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,003
What?

738
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,881
I wasn't there for you,

739
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,928
and I feel so bad.

740
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,392
While you were making
such painful decisions by yourself,

741
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,689
I had no idea because I was busy
working at the hospital.

742
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,360
I wouldn't have told you
even if you were jobless.

743
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,195
Why?

744
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,158
Because I wanted to keep
a good relationship with you.

745
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,457
If I told you everything,
you would've suffered too.

746
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,042
Just like now.

747
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,795
I'm completely fine.

748
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,506
It's all clear now.

749
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,968
Now I know

750
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,846
exactly what I need to do.

751
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,307
That's why my appetite is back.

752
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,689
Thank you.

753
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,111
I'm sorry.

754
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,286
Eat this.

755
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,671
You crossed the line.

756
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,465
You're in no place to say that.

757
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,843
I get that you feel anxious.

758
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,304
But you shouldn't have told my parents.

759
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,806
Do you really think so?
How selfish of you.

760
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,185
Then let me be selfish one more time.

761
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,646
Put up with me a bit longer.

762
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,481
You'll eventually beâ€¦

763
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,983
the last one standing.

764
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,277
Are you saying you won't end it now?

765
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,782
How can you be so brazen?

766
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,201
I can't make any plans
for summer next year.

767
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,870
I won't be here.

768
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,288
Are you emigrating?

769
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,918
Stop making excuses--

770
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,336
I'm not emigrating.

771
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,589
I'll be dead by then.

772
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:23,468
My days are numbered.

773
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,231
I'm sorry.

774
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,673
Mi-jo. Did you hear?
Dr. Kim doesn't need to go to the States.

775
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,299
I heard.

776
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,176
Why the long face?

777
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,640
I can tell something's wrong.
What is it? Tell me.

778
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,976
I'm just tired.

779
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,602
You can't fool me.

780
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,104
You're not tired.

781
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,732
A lot of things happened.

782
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,861
Chan-young's parents found out everything.

783
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,489
I feel so bad for them.

784
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,825
It's a good thing. They should know.

785
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:33,538
I get that Chan-young's sick,
but you're about to fall ill too.

786
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,374
You should get a vitamin shot.

787
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,960
I'll think about it. You should go home.

788
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,962
You too, Dr. Kim.

789
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,381
Come have dinner with us.

790
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,382
I'm not hungry.

791
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,218
You should eat. You look worn out.

792
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,846
He's right. Let's go grab a bite to eat.

793
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,307
Come on. I don't want to eat alone.

794
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,892
Please justâ€¦

795
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,560
Just let me get some rest.

796
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,193
Then make sure you drive safely, okay?

797
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,612
Go take a bath or something.

798
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,281
Okay, I will. I'm sorry.

799
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,325
Don't be sorry.

800
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,910
I'll be off now.

801
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,126
Let's go home.

802
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,135
Are you angry or sad?

803
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,603
Let's go for a run.

804
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,415
Mi-jo.

805
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,336
Although you never grew inside my belly,

806
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,631
I cared for you as if you did.

807
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,676
That's pretty much the same thing.

808
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,638
Whether or not I was pregnant with you
doesn't really matter.

809
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,349
Because you were

810
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,768
so beautiful and pure-hearted.

811
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,395
INMATE NUMBER 2382, LEE GYEONG-SUK

812
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,080
That's enough. You might get injured.

813
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,666
You said running would clear my head.

814
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,835
But it's still a mess.

815
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,796
-Let's keep running.
-Then how about we take a break?

816
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,007
Sit down for a bit. Sit down.

817
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,258
Why did you do that?

818
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,136
What?

819
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,889
I get that you were taken aback,

820
00:57:56,556 --> 00:58:00,185
but did you hate to have dinner
with my parents that much?

821
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,189
Oh, that. Mi-jo, that was because--

822
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,690
I didn't want to either.

823
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,651
Why would I want
to introduce you to my parents?

824
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,156
Don't say things you don't mean.
You'll end up regretting it.

825
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,365
Do I embarrass you?

826
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,452
Because I'm an orphan?

827
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,121
Because I was adopted?

828
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:21,706
Cha Mi-jo.

829
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,251
What? Are you scared
things might get serious?

830
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,088
Because you don't know
who my biological parents are?

831
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,840
Does that scare you now?

832
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,554
Get off me! Let go of me!

833
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,431
-I'm sorry.
-Let go.

834
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,601
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

835
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,270
Why did you react like that?

836
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,982
Why did you do that?

837
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,944
I didn't mean it that way.
You were mistaken, Mi-jo.

838
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,738
Why did you do that?

839
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,825
It's because

840
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,703
I love you so much.

841
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,708
That's why.

842
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,180
I didn't think I deserved you.

843
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,935
I didn't think
I should meet your parents like this.

844
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,437
I was ashamed to be my father's son.

845
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,691
I wasn't confident.

846
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,527
That's why I reacted that way. I'm sorry.

847
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,365
I'm sorry I didn't explain.

848
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,202
I'm sorry, okay?

849
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,456
I'm sorry.

850
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,890
I'm thirsty.

851
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,518
Me too.

852
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,563
Let's go.

853
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,674
What do you think
my parents are thinking right now?

854
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,679
They're probably worrying about you.

855
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,061
My life is like a comedy.

856
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,689
She threw a rolling pin at me,

857
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,025
and she even hit me with vegetables.

858
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:58,279
Gosh, I should've been there to see it.
It's a pity that I wasn't there.

859
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,990
If you were there,
she would've beaten you up.

860
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,622
I guess I deserve it.

861
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,377
If that's what it takes to be forgiven.

862
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,383
-Jin-seok.
-Yes?

863
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,303
Don't get divorced.

864
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,101
That's not your concern.

865
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,979
Jin-seok, I want usâ€¦

866
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,071
to part as friends, not lovers.

867
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,744
Let's think about it.

868
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,417
I want to go home alone.

869
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,110
Here. Have something warm.

870
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,703
What did So-won say?

871
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,330
She says she's fine, but I'm not sure.

872
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,253
I'm disappointed in your father.

873
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,968
I just noticed
that we both stopped using honorifics.

874
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,136
It's really nice.

875
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,263
I don't know about that.

876
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,222
Keep doing it.

877
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,515
Do what?

878
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,892
Talking without honorifics.

879
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,354
What's the matter?
I can tell something's bothering you.

880
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,398
You're thinking about something.

881
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,233
You made it sound a certain way.

882
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,195
You should've been clearer
about the subject.

883
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,488
You made it sound vague.

884
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,949
I guess you feel better now.
I'm going to go ahead and eat.

885
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,580
Did you meet your father?

886
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,165
Yes.

887
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,750
What did you say?

888
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,336
I told him to apologize to So-won.

889
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,670
And?

890
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,090
He's not willing to.
I hoped I could convince him.

891
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,010
I told him I won't see him again

892
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,596
if he doesn't apologize to her.

893
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,433
I need to make a ton of money now.

894
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,187
I told him I'd pay him back
every penny he's spent on me.

895
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,898
It turns outâ€¦

896
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,151
he spent a fortune raising me.

897
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,363
You'll need a raise.

898
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:46,906
I won't refuse.

899
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,293
I have

900
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,963
a new dream.

901
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,340
You're almost 40, and you have a dream?

902
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,133
After I pay my father back,

903
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,636
I'm going to keep making lots of money.

904
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,265
I'll save up
and buy my own land outside the city.

905
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,643
Then I'm going to build a house
and adopt as many orphans as possible.

906
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,979
I'll have a huge family.
What do you think?

907
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,648
You'll have to make a lot of money.

908
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,941
But that's not the issue.

909
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,569
No matter how rich I become,
I won't be able to adopt.

910
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,281
Apparently,
I need to have a stable family.

911
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:34,453
So I need to get married.

912
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,331
In conclusion, my dream isâ€¦

913
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,251
that I want to beâ€¦

914
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,462
your husband.

915
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:46,799
Whatâ€¦

916
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,682
Is this how people propose in America?

917
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,476
No, I came up with this on my own.

918
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:01,272
You know you can be
a little rash sometimes, right?

919
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,775
One of us needs to be rash
to push things ahead.

920
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:11,866
How about we go somewhere
and celebrate with some soju?

921
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,660
Celebrate what?

922
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,412
I'm not interested.

923
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:21,500
It's just a small wish of mine.
I told you that it's my dream.

924
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,586
Don't feel pressured. Okay?

925
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,925
It's drizzling outside,
so I figured we could drink some soju.

926
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,347
Not tonight.

927
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,350
My head isn't clear yet.

928
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,313
I'll drink once things are settled.

929
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,650
Try this.

930
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,879
You called us here this early.
Why aren't you saying anything?

931
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,007
It's about something important.

932
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,010
Let's wait until everyone's gone.

933
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,849
-Hey.
-Hey, Seon-u.

934
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,393
-Is business doing well?
-Yes.

935
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,438
It's strange that she called all of us.

936
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,273
What's with that serious look?

937
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,233
Long time no see.

938
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,193
Hey. You've become even more handsome.

939
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,570
-Thanks.
-Don't say things you don't mean.

940
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,156
Chan-young, you look prettier than ever.

941
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,866
-I know that.
-I see.

942
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,079
Just tell us.

943
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,247
Why did you call us?

944
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,004
Why couldn't you just ask us
to meet in your clinic where it's quiet?

945
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:48,921
I know, right?

946
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,155
-Seon-u.
-Yes?

947
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,240
Can you please sit next to Joo-hee?

948
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:23,831
Sure.

949
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,174
What's going on?

950
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,759
It's really important.

951
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:42,767
Chan-young and Seon-u.
Can you both lock arms with Joo-hee?

952
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:44,894
I'm going to leave.

953
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,354
I'm serious right now.

954
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,939
Just do what I ask.

955
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,445
Goodness, you're nuts. Like this?

956
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,614
Seon-u, you too.

957
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,117
Excuse me for a bit.

958
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,998
What is this?
It feels like I'm getting arrested.

959
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,001
I have shocking news.

960
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,965
I found my biological mother.

961
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,053
-My gosh. That's great.
-Goodness.

962
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,387
What? When?

963
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,555
Keep your arms locked.

964
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,225
Oh, right. Okay. Keep going.

965
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,560
How? How did you find her?

966
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,687
Hold on tight to Joo-hee.

967
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:29,814
Okay.

968
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,775
Joo-hee's momâ€¦

969
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:34,944
told me.

970
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:42,409
Apparently, she's known for a long time.

971
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:44,578
Hold onto her.

972
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,876
-Take her phone away.
-Come on!

973
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:55,881
My biological motherâ€¦

974
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,760
has been convicted of fraud seven times.

975
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:04,348
She's still doing time in prison.

976
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,104
Are you scared things might get serious?

977
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:13,190
Because you don't know
who my biological parents are?

978
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,109
Does that scare you now?

979
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,911
Seon-u, I'm not done talking yet.

980
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,122
Okay.

981
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,212
So I've decided to pay her a visit.

982
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:36,630
At Yeongwol Prison.

983
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,470
But as you probably know,
I have panic disorder.

984
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:47,349
If I get flustered
and end up getting a panic attack,

985
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,018
I might not be able to drive.

986
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:51,604
Who will come with me?

987
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:52,646
Me.

988
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,499
I hope Mi-jo doesn't collapse

989
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,752
because of a panic attack.

990
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,547
I should've gone with her.

991
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,342
We should've given her relaxing pills.

992
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:26,764
I was reminded of when I met Mi-jo
for the first time on the subway.

993
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,642
The day she went
looking for her biological mother.

994
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,976
YEONGWOL PRISON

995
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,019
Hey.

996
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,521
Why is she out already?

997
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,072
She doesn't look too good.

998
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,157
Did she not get to meet her?

999
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,623
We never let it show,

1000
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,627
but we were all desperate
to hear about her biological mother.

1001
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,214
Mi-jo.

1002
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:14,895
Mi-jo.

1003
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,814
What's wrong?

1004
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,793
Although it felt like a blessing
that the day came before I died,

1005
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,882
I had no idea it would be
so heartbreaking for all of us.

1006
01:11:54,184 --> 01:12:01,191
TRUSTWORTHY LAW
HAPPY YEONGWOL

1007
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,272
Though I didn't have high expectationsâ€¦

1008
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,982
It bothers me.

1009
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:48,489
I'll let you know every day

1010
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,284
how much I love you.

1011
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,371
It's my mom's last birthday
that I'll get to see.

1012
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,081
Do you desperately want that?

1013
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,584
So what if I'll be alone?

1014
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,503
Every single day is so precious.

1015
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:06,799
It's hard to be
the happiest terminally ill person.

1016
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:13,430
