1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,175
The glass windows
of a cake shop got shattered.

2
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,092
What?

3
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,178
-Three female friends
-Over a million views?

4
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,055
were responsible for the incident.

5
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,432
Let me see.

6
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,435
I can't believe this shop owner.

7
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,521
She obviously uploaded this
to promote her cake shop.

8
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,316
But look at the title.
"A Beautiful Robbery."

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,484
It's a touching story.

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,152
A robbery? That's absurd.

11
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,780
We even paid for
the glass windows that weren't broken.

12
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,947
Unbelievable.

13
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,867
-Let's read the comments.
-My gosh, seriously.

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,620
"That's a true friendship.
I wish I had friends like them."

15
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,041
"I root for your friendship.
I wish you guys good luck."

16
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,417
Gosh, look at all this.

17
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,838
"The second girl is so cool.
I wish she were my girlfriend."

18
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,423
-Who's the second girl?
-Me.

19
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,051
-What?
-That's me.

20
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,095
This guy is crazy.

21
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,848
-What are you typing?
-That you're mine.

22
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,809
-Don't do that. My gosh.
-Wait.

23
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,561
Are you the second girl, Joo-hee?

24
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,980
No, it's Mi-jo.

25
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,650
She picked up a brick first.

26
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,527
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,737
Then who's the third girl?

28
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,990
"I'm Jang Joo-hee, the third girl."

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,913
-My gosh, stop watching.
-No, wait.

30
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,748
-Stop.
-Just once more.

31
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,506
I was just really touched
by your friendship.

32
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,343
So I wanted to share your story
with lots of people.

33
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,679
I mean, we live in such a cold world.

34
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,055
You know what I mean, right?

35
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,306
Not really.

36
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,643
I didn't reveal any of your names though.

37
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,019
No one will recognize you.

38
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,146
That's…

39
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,691
This is driving me crazy.

40
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,276
Welcome.

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,277
Is this the place?

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,863
Yes. This is where
the terminal patient came, right?

43
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,698
Yes, that's right. Welcome.

44
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,909
Damn it.

45
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,954
Wait. Hey!

46
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,007
Yes. I'll be on my way
right after I sign some stuff.

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,175
Okay, I'll meet you there. Bye.

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,644
Do a lot of people go
to the dermatology clinic?

49
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,233
Yes.

50
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,128
You look excited.

51
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,212
No, I'm not.

52
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,380
Yes, you are.

53
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,548
No, I'm not.

54
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,176
Look at what you're wearing.
You're obviously excited.

55
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,053
-Sorry. I'm running late.
-What?

56
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,931
The signed documents are on my desk.

57
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,432
-Okay.
-Okay, Director.

58
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,772
It's Director Cha's day off today.

59
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,608
Was that Director Cha just now?

60
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,109
Yes.

61
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,955
HE WHO DANCES MUST PAY THE PIPER

62
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,041
EPISODE 10

63
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,532
What is that?

64
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,450
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR MOVIE, CHAN-YOUNG

65
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,035
This is so embarrassing.

66
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,203
My gosh, come on.

67
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,788
Chan-young.

68
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,915
You're here.

69
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,626
You're going to get your makeup done
before meeting the director, right?

70
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,504
Well, yes. Give us a second.

71
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,841
What is all this?

72
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,010
I'm just a supporting actor.

73
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,220
I only appear in five scenes.

74
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,682
This is what we do for our actors.
It's no big deal.

75
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,892
This is driving me crazy.

76
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,312
Chan-young!

77
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,646
There's our actress!

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,023
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SHOOT!

79
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,609
This is so embarrassing.

80
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,697
My goodness.

81
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,699
You're ruining your hair.

82
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,743
-Stop it.
-They're going to style it anyway.

83
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,620
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food.

84
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,749
Where's the leading man?

85
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,375
Does he stay inside?

86
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,377
Do you guys have a waiting room here?

87
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,129
-Maybe he's in his car.
-Maybe.

88
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,715
You came here to wish me good luck,

89
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,341
and you're looking for him?

90
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,551
-No way.
-No.

91
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,804
Did you get skincare?
Your skin is glowing.

92
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,347
I know, right?

93
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,475
I got a small filler injection
a few days ago.

94
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,977
Since I didn't have
a lot of patients that day.

95
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,729
Did you get one too?

96
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,646
No.

97
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,024
Seon-u gave her a small injection.

98
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,150
Unbelievable.

99
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,651
Chan-young, you must be cold.

100
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,029
Sir, where should I put this?

101
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,239
Put it behind the director's seat.

102
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,783
Will you stop?

103
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,034
-Don't.
-It's fine.

104
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,536
-Just leave it.
-She's right.

105
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,622
-Should I go sit on it?
-No.

106
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,042
This is my first movie.
Are you trying to ruin it for me?

107
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,251
-No.
-No.

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,759
Hey.

109
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,962
No, not too close.

110
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,173
Be careful.
You don't want to get too close to them.

111
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,716
Are they your friends?

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,218
Yes, you could say that.

113
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,970
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

114
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,556
-Hello.
-I'm a huge fan.

115
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,141
Gosh, thank you.

116
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,229
Look at all these snack carts.
Are they all yours, Ms. Jeong?

117
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm not even surprised.

118
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,859
There's a lot of food,

119
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,902
but don't eat too much. Stay fit.

120
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,279
I'll just have a bit.

121
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,072
I love tteokbokki.

122
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,282
Why the bag?

123
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,616
Be quiet.

124
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,201
Hey, no photos.

125
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,578
Okay.

126
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,914
-Can I have your autograph?
-Oh, sure.

127
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,041
-Where…
-You can do it here.

128
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,418
-Oh, okay.
-Here.

129
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,794
Thank you.

130
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,671
You're beautiful.

131
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,214
Thank you.

132
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,843
YIM SI-WAN

133
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,803
-What's your name?
-Cha Mi-jo.

134
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,807
-Cha Mi-jo.
-"Cha Mi-jo."

135
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,685
Can you write, "I wish you prosperity"?

136
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,353
-"I wish you prosperity"?
-Yes.

137
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,981
"I wish you prosperity."

138
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,193
She came prepared.
She must've planned this since yesterday.

139
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,195
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

140
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,031
I hope you don't use it
for something weird.

141
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,365
No, of course not.

142
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,909
She won't do anything illegal.

143
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,703
Can I have it on this?

144
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,663
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

145
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,916
-A huge autograph, please.
-Sure.

146
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,463
What's your name?

147
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,215
Jang Joo-hee.

148
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,092
-Jang Joo-hee.
-"Jang Joo-hee."

149
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,010
Okay.

150
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,058
Let's begin.

151
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,941
Are you really not going to meet Ji-yeon?

152
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,194
What's the point? All we ever do is fight.

153
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,571
Still, you should meet her.
She waited for you.

154
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,822
I'll decide for myself.

155
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,618
Don't tell me…

156
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,456
I can't believe you did it.

157
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,875
You're insane.

158
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,711
The director will kill you
if he finds out.

159
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,463
You wrote the article?

160
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,757
So don't tell Ji-yeon.

161
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,264
Great work today.

162
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,348
-Hey.
-Hey.

163
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,350
-Ms. Jeong.
-Yes?

164
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,063
Look who it is. Mr. Yim Si-wan.

165
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,190
It was an honor.

166
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,276
No, it was my honor.

167
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,252
I'm really glad that I got the chance…

168
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,755
to work with you.

169
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,321
I was already really nervous.

170
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,781
Then Mi-jo and Joo-hee made
a huge deal out of everything.

171
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,075
I was so embarrassed
that I wanted to hide.

172
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,869
So? Did you do well?

173
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,120
-Gosh, it's okay.
-Let me.

174
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,372
I was too nervous that I don't remember.

175
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,041
I'm still nervous.

176
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,376
She did great.
She barely made any mistakes.

177
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,669
-Come on.
-Really?

178
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,297
-When can we see it?
-What?

179
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,174
The movie.

180
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,259
It'll probably come out next summer.

181
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,344
Right, Jin-seok?

182
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,809
Well, I'm not sure.

183
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,316
Dad, how are you going to fix this?

184
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,818
I know, right?

185
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,737
I shouldn't have asked that.

186
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,865
Eat nice things and sleep well.

187
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,825
And we'll watch it together next summer.

188
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,743
Here. Drink this.

189
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,787
What is it?

190
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,917
Gosh, did you go somewhere
and collect spring water again?

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,294
I told you there could be
parasites in there.

192
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,754
What are you talking about?

193
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,091
It's medicinal herb tea. Drink it.

194
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,723
-Gosh, it's so bitter.
-Drink up.

195
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,728
TO CHA MI-JO
I WISH YOU PROSPERITY

196
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,356
It doesn't really stand out.

197
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,857
Let's just put it here.

198
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,610
Why don't we hang it there?

199
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,697
Why don't you just hang it in your office?

200
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,784
Then others won't be able to see it.
It's for the patients to see.

201
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,372
He was so good-looking.

202
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,582
His face was so tiny.

203
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,043
Your face is tiny too.

204
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,212
No, it's not about the size.

205
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,299
He was walking toward us,
and there was a huge halo.

206
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,843
He looked amazing.

207
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,345
He must get skincare, right?

208
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,889
I wonder where he goes.

209
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,350
You should've gotten one for the clinic.

210
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,936
Why did you ask him to sign it to you?

211
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,689
Are you upset?

212
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,107
No.

213
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,485
Anyway, can I go home now?

214
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,029
While you were at a fan meeting,
I had to stay here all day.

215
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,198
I didn't even have time to eat lunch.

216
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,452
Then to celebrate my meeting
with Yim Si-wan today,

217
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,537
I'll buy you something expensive.

218
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,873
Jeez.

219
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,128
I'm too embarrassed
to go anywhere these days.

220
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,506
I canceled all my golf appointments.

221
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,759
Why are you so embarrassed?
Lots of people get divorced.

222
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,471
Rumors spread like fire.
You know how it is.

223
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,056
People will find out
that Ju-won isn't yours.

224
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,142
Mom, stop saying that.

225
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,728
You're practically the one
spreading the rumor.

226
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,021
How could you say that?

227
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,315
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

228
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,609
If I knew this was going to happen…

229
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,862
What?

230
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,031
What does she do?

231
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,950
That wannabe actress
you dated for a while.

232
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,660
She hasn't been around.

233
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,954
Does she not act anymore?

234
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,831
Why do you ask?

235
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,082
Is she married?

236
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,292
Mom.

237
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,669
Now that you're getting a divorce,

238
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,672
I just think you should
marry the woman you love.

239
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,175
Why couldn't you say that to me then?

240
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,928
Why couldn't you
just approve of her back then?

241
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,060
I have plans. I'll get going.

242
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,187
Do you resent me?

243
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,981
Because I was against you marrying her?

244
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,863
Yes, I have resentment.

245
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,574
I resent myself.

246
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,702
I resent myself
for not coming to my senses sooner.

247
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,584
But don't bring her up like that
as if she's just a replacement.

248
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,044
She deserves better than us.

249
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,087
I just…

250
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,926
My gosh, I can't believe… Goodness.

251
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,554
-Hi!
-Hi!

252
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,014
Hey, guys!

253
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:09,974
-Hi!
-How are you?

254
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,226
Have you been well?

255
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,271
Hoon seems to only like you, Mi-jo.

256
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,897
What were you doing, Hoon?

257
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,611
Let's go inside. Just a second.

258
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,535
We could've waited
to discuss things about Ju-won.

259
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,581
I always felt so anxious.

260
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,751
But now, I want to be at ease.

261
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,591
Let's tell Ju-won once he's older.
He's too young right now.

262
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,720
I agree. Let's take our time.

263
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,142
Ju-won and I are going to England.

264
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,649
-Why?
-What's the point of staying here?

265
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,403
Everything's ready.
A house and a school for Ju-won.

266
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,071
Let him finish the semester here.

267
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,784
He's going to drop out.

268
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,162
You know how fast rumors spread here.

269
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,499
I didn't want Ju-won to hear any rumors,
so I rushed things.

270
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,501
That's too far away.

271
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,507
I have close friends in England.

272
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,970
They're going to help us settle down.

273
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,142
How is Ju-won? I bet he's shocked.

274
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,939
You should try talking to him.

275
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,024
He doesn't smile.

276
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,034
Give my regards to Chan-young.

277
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,207
What about you?

278
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,044
How are things?

279
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,173
I bet your parents are shocked too.

280
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,759
They're furious.

281
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,679
That's why I want to leave
as soon as possible.

282
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,147
Next time, I'll teach you
English words related to animals, okay?

283
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,608
-Okay.
-That's it for today.

284
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,986
-Bye.
-Bye.

285
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,070
Bye.

286
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,533
Let's see.

287
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,953
Hey.

288
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,331
That's a promise ring, isn't it?

289
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,208
How did you know?

290
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:45,087
I told Mi-jo that you were single.

291
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,380
You did?

292
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,925
You were our little cupid.
What did she say when you told her?

293
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,927
She thanked me for the information.

294
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,347
Are you going to marry her?

295
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,895
Why don't we come up with a plan?
You know she's stubborn, right?

296
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,605
Still, she's kind.

297
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,857
So you know.

298
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,111
She's kind, pretty, and smart.

299
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,281
She's a rare breed.

300
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,199
Who said that?

301
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,242
The director.

302
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,582
I'll try to come up with a good idea.

303
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,959
I know

304
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,754
Mi-jo very well.

305
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,089
Then I'm counting on you, Hoon.

306
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,257
Okay.

307
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,383
Let's do this.

308
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,385
-Let's clean up.
-Okay.

309
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,470
Here we go.

310
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
Thanks.

311
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,937
Doesn't it get boring?

312
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,066
Time really flies.

313
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,528
Maybe you keep yourself busy
to take your mind off things.

314
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,034
I understand.

315
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,163
When there's a lot on your mind,
it's better to tire yourself out

316
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,290
and get a good night's sleep.

317
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,257
So-won, do you remember anything
about your parents?

318
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,678
No, I parted with them
when I was really little.

319
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,222
I see.

320
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,017
Do you know where they live?

321
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,563
I heard they both passed away
due to an accident.

322
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,321
Everyone has a sad story.

323
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,909
They're all so sad.

324
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,917
So-won.

325
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,964
Do you think
you became a good piano player

326
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,092
because of your adoptive father's money?

327
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,470
That's what he always told me,

328
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,306
so I guess it's true.

329
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,020
I wouldn't be able to get into Juilliard
even if I received the same education.

330
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,482
Not everyone can become that good.

331
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,526
You were born with the gift,

332
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,613
and it came from your late parents.

333
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,754
I'll be honest with you.

334
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,175
I'm not very fond of Seon-u's father.

335
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,093
He wanted to meet me.

336
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,053
What for?

337
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,850
Pretty obvious, isn't it?

338
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,395
He wanted me to stop seeing your brother.

339
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,526
I think

340
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,738
I know how you felt.

341
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,536
It was really hard to stand it
when he said those things to me.

342
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,540
But if I break up, it'll be a loss for me.

343
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,751
Where will I find
someone like your brother?

344
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,919
Don't you agree?

345
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,840
It's your loss

346
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,800
to be like this.

347
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,514
I bet your parents are
feeling really upset from above,

348
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,809
watching the gift
they gave you go to waste.

349
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,865
I'm going to go help with dinner.

350
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,057
-Thanks.
-It's hot. Careful.

351
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,899
They're going to England.

352
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,488
But I'm worried because Ju-won's so young.

353
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,283
Convince her to stay.

354
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,786
She already bought a place to live

355
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,205
and even decided on Ju-won's school.

356
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,380
I met my mom
for the first time in a while.

357
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,175
Seon-ju had told her everything.
Even about Ju-won.

358
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,308
Why did she do that?

359
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,727
That's probably why she wants to leave.

360
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,523
You must be

361
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,568
really worried about Ju-won.

362
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,361
Yes, I am.

363
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,587
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

364
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,922
-Come in.
-Your next patient is here.

365
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,257
Okay.

366
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,508
Come on in.

367
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,558
Goodness, you have a lot of patients.

368
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,270
Do a lot of people go
to the dermatology clinic?

369
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,066
Yes, we do.

370
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,035
You kind of look like your mom,

371
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,496
but you're also a bit different.

372
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,958
What can I help you with?

373
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,217
You know Lee Gyeong-suk, right?

374
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,178
Your mom.

375
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,639
Who are you?

376
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,640
I need this one.

377
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,974
-Okay.
-Thanks.

378
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,481
-You can go.
-Oh, okay.

379
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,244
You see, Gyeong-suk owes me something.

380
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,874
You've come to the wrong place.

381
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,669
Please leave
if you're not here as a patient.

382
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,881
Don't turn your back on her.
Your mom and I will be disappointed.

383
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,758
What's going on, Dr. Cha?

384
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,593
Well…

385
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,222
It's nothing. You can get back to work.

386
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,975
What's going on?

387
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,147
You're really making it harder than it is.

388
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,773
I'll treat you, sir. Come with me.

389
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,240
This doesn't concern you.

390
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,366
I said, come with me.

391
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,659
Dr. Kim.

392
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,786
Dr. Cha, what's the matter?

393
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,665
Who are you?

394
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,586
Are you not going to leave?

395
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,172
My goodness.

396
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,966
You have a lot of allies.

397
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,930
I'll see you next time.

398
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,698
Who is he?

399
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,785
He came to the wrong place.
I don't know him.

400
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,037
Are you okay?

401
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,706
Yes, I'm fine. Let's get back to work.

402
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:13,220
Jin-seok, can I see Ju-won for a moment?

403
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,479
Ju-won?

404
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,111
Thanks for coming to see me.

405
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,073
I've always wanted to meet you.

406
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,910
Well, you see…

407
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,454
I'm your dad's close friend.

408
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,289
Okay.

409
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,750
I heard you're going to England.

410
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,751
Yes.

411
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,380
That's amazing. I've never been there.

412
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,674
It's also my first time.

413
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,803
I bet you're going to miss your dad.

414
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,145
Here.

415
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,234
Open it.

416
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,034
THE RED BOOK
BY BARBARA LEHMAN

417
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,504
DEDICATED TO MY FATHER

418
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,424
I just wanted to give you this book.

419
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,265
Look.

420
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,729
Your dad might fly over to visit you
with the help of a bunch of balloons.

421
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,776
Your English is going to be great.

422
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,696
That's going to be cool.

423
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,115
I'm already pretty good.

424
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,688
What are you doing?

425
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,609
Dad's friend gave me a present.

426
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,693
His friend?

427
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,696
Yes. A small and pale lady.

428
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,995
Is it fun?

429
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,996
Yes.

430
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,164
Let's read it together.

431
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,630
I'll look into it.

432
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,427
Great work today, guys.

433
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,138
I'm off now. See you tomorrow.

434
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,015
-Get home safely.
-See you tomorrow.

435
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,058
See you.

436
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,066
-Let's go home.
-Wait.

437
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,360
Can we talk?

438
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,070
You seemed startled earlier.

439
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,822
It was nothing.

440
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,782
I'm really tired. Let's go.

441
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,759
Who is she?

442
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,178
Mi-jo's older sister.

443
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,975
-Why is she here?
-I don't know.

444
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,936
Stop whispering
and get over here, Joo-hee.

445
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,191
Mi-hyeon, the yangjangpi is good.
Why aren't you eating it?

446
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,485
Sit down.

447
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,237
Okay.

448
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,532
-Hey, Mi-hyeon.
-Chan-young's here.

449
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,326
-What is it?
-I don't know.

450
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,870
Stop whispering!

451
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,080
Did you hear?

452
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,665
Sit. Both of you.

453
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,501
Sit down.

454
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,972
Tell me what happened

455
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,600
with Mi-jo.

456
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,396
Don't you dare lie to me.

457
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,690
You know what will happen
if you get caught.

458
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,776
Yes, of course.

459
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,529
A strange man came to the clinic today.

460
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,115
And Mi-jo shivered in fear.

461
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,409
Who is he? You guys know, don't you?

462
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,164
I've never seen her so frightened before.

463
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,043
Did something happen recently?

464
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,924
Well, to tell the truth…

465
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,179
Mi-jo found her biological mother.

466
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,723
When?

467
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
Not long ago.

468
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,355
And we accompanied her there.

469
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,481
Did you meet her too?

470
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:20,068
No. We just waited outside.

471
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,569
So we don't know what happened.

472
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,570
Where was it?

473
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,282
Where?

474
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,828
A prison.

475
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,250
Fuck.

476
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,755
She's in prison?

477
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,174
Yes.

478
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,760
Mi-jo went there to visit her?

479
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:47,887
Yes.

480
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,352
Did she kill someone?

481
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,021
-No.
-She committed fraud.

482
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,526
She's been convicted
of seven counts of fraud.

483
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,658
Unbelievable.

484
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,555
I wonder what's going on with Mi-jo.

485
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,309
Who do you think came to see her?

486
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,103
And why did he come?

487
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:17,435
MOM

488
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,241
Hey, Mom.

489
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,953
Did you have dinner?

490
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,538
Yes, I did too.

491
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,168
Mom, how about some ice cream?

492
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,216
Even though it's winter,
ice cream still tastes delicious.

493
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,553
For me, ice cream tastes best
when you have it after an exam.

494
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,056
You used to go to a supermarket

495
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,184
as soon as you finished your exams.
Did you do that in college too?

496
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,061
No.

497
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,313
I drank then.

498
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,864
Mom.

499
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,116
Is something wrong?

500
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,912
-Does it show?
-Your face says it all.

501
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,289
What is it?

502
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,420
Back when I was in high school,

503
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,506
do you remember
how I left to find my biological mother?

504
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,927
Of course. Thanks to that,
you made two best friends.

505
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,179
Right.

506
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,183
It turns out

507
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,603
that I went to the right place.

508
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,900
My biological mother
really used to work there.

509
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,573
Recently, I met Joo-hee's mom.

510
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,494
She gave me
my birth mother's contact number.

511
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,375
And? Did you meet her?

512
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:08,963
Yes.

513
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:15,553
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

514
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,307
Don't be.

515
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,811
I'm the one who's sorry, Mi-jo.

516
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,065
Why are you sorry?

517
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,527
To tell the truth,

518
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,908
I knew all along
where your biological mother was.

519
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,329
If I knew you were going to find out,

520
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,750
I guess I should've
told you about her earlier.

521
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,968
You knew?

522
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,515
What about Dad?

523
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,102
He knows too. But Mi-hyeon has no idea.

524
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,188
I'm sorry we didn't tell you.

525
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,486
I think I know why.

526
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,781
It was my first time going to a prison.

527
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,951
Judging by her character,

528
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,247
she didn't seem to have lived
such a great life.

529
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,541
That's just

530
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,168
the feeling I got.

531
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,297
I guess you guys didn't tell me

532
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,635
because of the situation she was in.

533
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,971
No, not necessarily.

534
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,141
You didn't seem interested
in finding her anymore.

535
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,437
So we were going to tell you
if you ever mentioned her again.

536
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,941
Well…

537
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,528
-Mom.
-Yes?

538
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,782
The thing is…

539
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,415
I don't know what to do.

540
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,333
Is there something wrong?

541
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,214
Today, a strange man…

542
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,676
came to see me at the clinic.

543
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,057
He told me
Lee Gyeong-suk owed him something.

544
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,689
What a joke.

545
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,236
Right, Mom?

546
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,741
How could he…

547
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,493
What's wrong with him?

548
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,122
What do you want to do?

549
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,293
I don't know.

550
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,963
Should I meet him and talk to him?

551
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,884
No, don't.
I don't want to put you through that.

552
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,471
It must've been so hard
to go through this all by yourself.

553
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,682
That's why I came to see you.

554
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,988
Mi-jo.

555
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,368
No matter

556
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,246
how much you feel sorry for her,

557
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,624
you still shouldn't give her money.

558
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:36,170
You may think of it as a one-time thing,
but that wasn't the case.

559
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,215
I mean, it might not be the case.

560
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,677
She came to you too?

561
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,888
She came to you too?

562
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,933
Mom!

563
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,770
No one came.

564
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,693
Listen calmly, Mi-jo.

565
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,699
She reached out to us one day.

566
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,954
You know how we used to
frequently visit the child care center?

567
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,872
I guess she found out.

568
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,378
It started when you were
around 30 years old.

569
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,427
She said it was urgent
and wanted to meet you.

570
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,098
But we didn't want you
to find out about it.

571
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:35,396
Back then, you barely got any sleep
because you were a resident.

572
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,568
So we helped her out once.

573
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,990
But she continued to ask us for help.

574
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,160
That's what happened.

575
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,788
I'm sorry we didn't tell you, Mi-jo.

576
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,215
Wait for me. It's cold.

577
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,847
I'm embarrassed.

578
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,393
Don't be embarrassed.

579
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,316
Mom.

580
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,612
Didn't that make you hate me?

581
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,366
Didn't you hate me

582
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,243
because I reminded you of her?

583
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,704
Why would I ever hate you?

584
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,665
You had nothing to do with what happened.

585
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,094
I did think…

586
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,431
that it's such a relief
that you're with us.

587
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,436
This may sound selfish,

588
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,440
but I was relieved
that you didn't grow up with her.

589
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,322
Your life would have been really tough.

590
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,453
You see, Mom…

591
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,002
I think I was always worried…

592
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,216
that a day like this would come.

593
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,469
But…

594
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,764
in the end,

595
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,811
it really did.

596
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,106
And it turned out to be

597
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,193
more horrible than I expected.

598
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,159
Mom.

599
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,080
Thank you.

600
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,169
And I'm sorry.

601
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,316
I'm sorry, Mom.

602
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,871
Something's up, right?

603
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,876
Yes.

604
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,337
Where were you coming from?

605
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,463
Samseong-dong.

606
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,966
I went to see my mom.

607
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,093
Did something happen to her?

608
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:35,844
No.

609
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,807
I just felt hopeless.

610
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,810
I figured she might be

611
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,896
able to help me find the answer.

612
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,364
Earlier…

613
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,413
The man who came to the clinic…

614
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,873
Yes, who is that guy?

615
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,212
My biological mother sent him.

616
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,674
Apparently, she owes him money

617
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,553
and sent him to me.

618
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,808
My plan was

619
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,686
to tell my mom everything

620
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,397
and come up with a plan.

621
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,399
But…

622
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,112
it turns out she's asked my parents

623
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,324
for money several times.

624
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,621
I see.

625
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,626
Speechless, right?

626
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,254
I feel the same way.

627
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,759
I'm not very good with words.

628
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,136
You can't badmouth her

629
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,306
because she's my biological mother,

630
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,060
but you can't defend her either

631
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,605
because of my adoptive parents.

632
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,358
There's nothing you can say.

633
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,285
Do you want instant noodles?

634
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,038
I'm out of instant noodles.

635
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,006
I'm glad you're here.

636
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,885
Are you flustered?

637
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,303
No…

638
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,180
It's nice.

639
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,475
It's nice to hear that.
I feel overwhelmed.

640
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,770
I don't know what to say.

641
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,356
Then why don't you look happy?

642
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,403
Because eating noodles with you

643
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,155
is all I can do for you.

644
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,953
I was glad

645
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,914
when I saw you
standing in front of my place.

646
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,626
If I told my sister,

647
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,462
she'd probably go
to that prison to throw a fit.

648
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,507
And Chan-young is sick.

649
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,678
As for Joo-hee,
I was worried she might end up crying

650
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,805
out of unnecessary guilt.

651
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,891
But you were

652
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,561
standing there smiling.

653
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,022
It was nice.

654
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,568
You see,

655
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,322
I'm going to stay by your side…

656
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,120
till death do us part.

657
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,039
Right.

658
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,044
You really aren't good with words.

659
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,005
You were right.

660
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,550
"Till death do us part"?

661
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,095
It's old-fashioned and nice.

662
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,307
I bet kids these days
don't even know what that means.

663
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,434
I don't care as long as you get it.

664
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,353
-I also don't know what it means.
-You don't?

665
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,813
-I'm 22 years old.
-What?

666
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,649
You're not 39?

667
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,734
No.

668
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,121
Are you even human?

669
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,957
How could you do that?

670
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,627
You told me you missed your daughter.

671
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,254
You cried and told me
that you regretted everything.

672
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,549
So I thought
you had learned your lesson, so I…

673
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,387
Did you want to meet her to do that?

674
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,682
Don't ever call her again.

675
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,018
That's the only thing
you can do to repent.

676
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,649
How dare she? That evil…

677
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,571
Mom, what's wrong?

678
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,327
It's nothing to worry about. Let's eat.

679
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,681
Ju-won is going
to take that book to England.

680
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,475
What is it about?

681
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,898
It's a deep story about happiness…

682
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,360
and yearning.

683
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,697
Isn't it just a kids' book?

684
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,996
By the way, where are we going?

685
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,209
Somewhere I need to go,
but I couldn't go by myself.

686
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,669
Are we meeting someone?

687
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,130
Not really.

688
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,426
Let's just go.

689
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,679
I'm nervous.

690
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,229
MEMORIAL HALL

691
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,859
We came all the way here.

692
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,694
Come help me.

693
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,529
If I reserve a spot,

694
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,573
it'll make things easier.

695
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,577
I thought about it.

696
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,040
When the time comes,
my parents will be too sad to do anything.

697
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,501
But still,
how could you think of doing this?

698
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,088
I should've come by myself.

699
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,089
Chan-young.

700
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,341
Then who…

701
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,510
Who else could I come here with?

702
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,512
With my parents?

703
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,015
Should I reserve a spot
at a columbarium with them?

704
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,521
You were the only one I could come with.

705
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,483
I thought about asking Mi-jo and Joo-hee.

706
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,278
But these days,
we barely look at each other.

707
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,573
If any of us starts crying,
we might all end up bawling.

708
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,242
So I couldn't ask them to come here.

709
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,499
I'm sorry.

710
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,585
I know it's hard for you too.

711
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,601
Let's go.

712
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,522
I'm sorry.

713
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,274
It must've been hard for you.

714
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,111
I'll go with you.

715
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,333
Let's not cry in there.

716
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,878
Let's not say it's for me.

717
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,756
Let's just check it out.

718
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,511
Let's do this.

719
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,980
Hey, Mi-jo.

720
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,857
Hey.

721
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,570
Do you have time at lunch today?

722
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:36,700
You must be busy.

723
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,870
No, I only see patients on the day,
so I'm okay.

724
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,997
Seon-u's the one who's busy.

725
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,501
Anyway, is something wrong?

726
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,004
You don't look so well.

727
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,843
My mom…

728
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:02,058
I think I overheard my mom
talking to her this morning.

729
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,101
"Her"?

730
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,313
Yes. Her. Your birth mother.

731
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,570
The thing is, my mom seemed really upset.

732
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,906
I'm not sure

733
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,659
if it's okay to ask you this,

734
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:25,624
but Mi-hyeon told me that a strange man
came to see you at the clinic.

735
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,334
You met Mi-hyeon?

736
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:33,465
Yes. She called me and Chan-young,
so we both met up with her.

737
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,552
I see.

738
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,223
It seems like something's up with you,

739
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,059
and my mom was yelling this morning.

740
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,564
So I'm just really worried.

741
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,109
What's going on?

742
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,321
It's nothing.

743
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,240
Don't worry.

744
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,451
Gosh, why did she even…

745
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,208
Mi-jo.

746
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,335
Yes?

747
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,213
My mom did nothing wrong, right?

748
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,509
All she did was try
to help you meet your birth mother.

749
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,679
I know.

750
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,890
Do you really?

751
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,102
What do you mean?

752
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,187
Do you really think that way?

753
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,566
Do you really think
my mom didn't do anything wrong?

754
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,318
Yes, I do.

755
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,201
But Joo-hee,

756
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,789
I think you're crossing the line here.

757
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,251
What? How so?

758
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,756
Never mind. I'm sorry.

759
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,967
Why won't you…

760
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,013
Why won't you tell me?
I always tell you everything.

761
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,974
It's always like this with us.

762
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:11,521
You and Chan-young talk about everything.
I'm always the last to know.

763
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,940
-Joo-hee.
-The same with Chan-young's illness.

764
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,693
You guys found out first,
and I was the last to find out.

765
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,112
You know I went to the department store.

766
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,656
I went there to tell you--

767
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,824
I know.

768
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,784
You couldn't bring yourself to tell me

769
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,580
because you knew
I had to take my mom to the hospital.

770
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,623
But you see, Mi-jo…

771
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,961
I can take it together with you guys.

772
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,380
Why do you guys suffer first

773
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,425
and wait until the last moment
to tell me things?

774
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,740
I'm sorry. You're going through a lot too.
I shouldn't have…

775
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,827
Joo-hee.

776
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,417
I didn't know you thought…

777
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,464
I didn't know you felt that way.

778
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,177
But you got it all wrong.

779
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,514
It's not like that.

780
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,352
To be honest,

781
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,024
I'm scared about Chan-young leaving us.

782
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,155
I'm also scared that things
might not be the same between us…

783
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,703
once she's gone.

784
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,387
I'm helpless.

785
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,431
I'm sorry.

786
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,894
I need to go now.
I'll see you later. I'm sorry.

787
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,717
Joo-hee.

788
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,386
That brat.

789
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,162
Thank you.

790
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,998
Why are we meeting at Joo-hee's?

791
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,833
We haven't seen her mom in a while.

792
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,376
Let's go inside. It's cold.

793
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,462
Joo-hee's in for a surprise.

794
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,172
What? You didn't tell her?

795
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,344
Hey, Mom.

796
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,845
Welcome.

797
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,348
I haven't seen you girls in ages.

798
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,016
Are you glad to see us?

799
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,977
Yes, I am. I'm glad you came.

800
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,604
Joo-hee.

801
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,815
Make some tea. They must be cold.

802
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,650
Okay.

803
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,962
Mom.

804
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,673
Yes?

805
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:08,967
I…

806
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,219
met her.

807
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,388
You know that, right?

808
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,729
I came to tell you
how it felt to meet my birth mother.

809
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,109
You didn't need to do that.

810
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,698
I heard a creditor came to your clinic.

811
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,827
I shouldn't have told you
about Gyeong-suk.

812
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,289
I'm so sorry, Mi-jo.

813
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,583
He was a creditor?

814
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,418
My mom didn't know it'd happen.

815
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:47,213
Goodness, that's not what she meant.

816
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,923
What's with you?

817
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,011
Did she

818
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,221
ever ask you for money?

819
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:02,270
Apparently, she's taken
quite an amount from my parents.

820
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,942
Mom.

821
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,403
It must've been hard.

822
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,368
I finally understand

823
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,581
why you couldn't tell me about her

824
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,167
all these years.

825
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,297
I mean, talk about a mess, right?

826
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,383
Mi-jo.

827
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,429
Yes?

828
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,639
I…

829
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:43,603
still remember the day
you first came to the snack bar.

830
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,939
SILOAM SNACK BAR

831
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,116
Thank you. Bye.

832
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,411
You seemed like Gyeong-suk's daughter,

833
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,538
but you were so…

834
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,958
You were so pretty.

835
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,294
You were such a good kid.

836
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,305
After that, I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

837
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,726
But the three of you became best friends

838
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:29,107
and even took turns
taking care of me at the hospital.

839
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,777
I just couldn't…

840
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,531
tell you the truth.

841
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,534
Mom.

842
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,330
Thanks to you…

843
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,795
Because you chose to keep it to yourself

844
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,339
and bore it by yourself,

845
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,475
the three of us were able
to make so many fond memories.

846
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,021
Every time I think about

847
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,858
how hard it must've been for you,

848
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,235
it makes my heart ache.

849
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,156
Thank you, Mom.

850
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,039
Goodness, what's wrong with me?

851
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:30,501
Why can't I stop crying?
It's because I'm old.

852
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,087
I'm going to go wash my face.

853
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,655
Joo-hee.

854
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,407
You should drink some too.

855
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,786
What tea is this?

856
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,746
Mi-jo.

857
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,459
Joo-hee.

858
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,586
You see, Mi-jo…

859
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,921
Mi-jo.

860
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,548
Yes?

861
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,470
It's okay. Say what you want to say.

862
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,141
Thank you…

863
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,562
for saying that…

864
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,902
to my mom.

865
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,917
Hey.

866
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,887
It's okay.

867
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,061
It's okay.

868
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,154
Gosh.

869
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,321
My ear hurts.

870
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,131
Where did you park your car?

871
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,051
Down there. The parking lot was full.
It's cold, isn't it?

872
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,136
No, I'm okay.

873
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,897
It's tough, isn't it?

874
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,526
You have no idea how scared I was.

875
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,487
Why?

876
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,114
There was a huge mess to clean up,

877
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,701
but you and Joo-hee were both hurting,

878
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,455
and I was worried I might leave
without being able to help.

879
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,168
You both were trying hard to act okay
because I was sick,

880
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,296
but I was worried that you guys

881
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,799
might fall apart once I was gone.

882
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,594
I was really scared.

883
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,223
You don't need to worry about that.

884
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,892
Just focus on taking care of yourself.

885
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,770
I feel at ease now.

886
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,981
You handled things nicely today.

887
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,446
I think I'll be able to leave peacefully.

888
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,830
Will you please stop?

889
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,874
Stop saying such things.

890
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,838
Don't say such things, okay?

891
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,424
Okay, I won't. I really won't.

892
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,927
If you cry, you owe me 100,000 won.

893
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,428
You're crying, aren't you?

894
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,764
What do you want to do with that money?

895
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,226
I'll treat you and Joo-hee
to some nice liquor.

896
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,770
How about we go to a snack cart?
I'll drink water.

897
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,605
Let's celebrate with a drink.

898
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,608
I haven't even started.

899
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,861
"He who dances must pay the piper."

900
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,238
Why are you suddenly quoting a proverb?

901
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,449
Do you think I don't know what that means?

902
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,245
But why do you have to pay the piper?

903
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,873
You must really know the meaning.

904
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:42,128
I told you that I read Land
from start to finish.

905
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,380
Of course, I know what it means.

906
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,135
"He who dances must pay the piper."

907
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:55,600
It means whoever created a mess
should be the one to clean it up.

908
01:04:55,683 --> 01:05:00,187
TRUSTWORTHY LAW
HAPPY YEONGWOL

909
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:04,400
If my relationship with my birth mother
is the cause of all this mess,

910
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:08,988
then the one who cleans up that mess

911
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,866
should be me.

912
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,952
It's just wrong.

913
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,954
Every now and then, I forget

914
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:01,082
that Chan-young's fighting this alone.

915
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,042
I shot a photo for my funeral.

916
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:06,212
She couldn't even smile
when she took the photo.

917
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,464
Hey, I like this angle.

918
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:09,966
Chan-young.

919
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,052
I really lived a great life.

920
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,930
You guys and Jin-seok.

921
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,348
I'm grateful.

922
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:22,603
I wish I could take away your pain
and be sick instead of you.

923
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:27,400
