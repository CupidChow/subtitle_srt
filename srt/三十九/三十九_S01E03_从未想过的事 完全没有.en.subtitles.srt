1
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,798
This Europe tour package is available

2
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,051
-for only 45 minutes.
-Hey. Let's go on that.

3
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,262
-Okay?
-Come on. That's Europe.

4
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,307
I'm sick of going to Southeast Asia.

5
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,600
I've never been to Europe.

6
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,560
-Please?
-How about Taiwan?

7
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,353
I heard it's wonderful there.

8
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,607
I have to take an extended leave
for Europe, but I can't do that.

9
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,152
Let's go to Taiwan.
Let's eat dim sum and play golf.

10
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,529
-Sounds great.
-Hey, we don't golf.

11
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,491
Then learn. I'll give you my clubs.
I'm replacing my old ones

12
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,577
-with new ones.
-What are you talking about?

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,622
Gosh, forget it then.
We seriously don't get along.

14
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,248
-We don't.
-Tell me about it.

15
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,458
-Gosh.
-Seriously.

16
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,335
You're so self-centered.

17
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,921
Come on. Let's go to Europe.

18
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,422
-Let's go.
-You're just

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,090
as self-centered as she is.

20
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,343
Hold on. Let's watch this.

21
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,386
We provide over 50 items for the funeral.

22
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,639
Funeral services
on home shopping channels?

23
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,765
That's impressive.

24
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,934
Why are you interested?

25
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,393
What?

26
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,812
Thinking about your mom?

27
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,982
I mean, I'm an only child.

28
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,152
Everyone around me has
already found a funeral service.

29
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,822
What's there to worry about
when she has three daughters?

30
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,418
By the way,

31
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,881
what if we keep living like this,
grow old, and die?

32
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,968
Our parents won't be around,
and our siblings might not be able

33
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,761
to do it for us.

34
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,097
Then who'll hold our funerals?

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,058
Excuse me, but I will get married.

36
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,978
-Leave me out of this.
-Sure,

37
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,437
but get married first.

38
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,564
You little…

39
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,150
-What? What's this for?
-What is it?

40
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,527
-What? Loser pays for jokbal? Okay.
-What?

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,529
-The loser pays, rock, paper, scissors!
-Paper, scissors!

42
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,697
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

43
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,824
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

44
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,326
-Yes!
-Damn it! I'm so stupid!

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,121
I want bossam. Order half of each.

46
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,165
-Hey, do you have soju?
-What are you doing?

47
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,667
-What? We played.
-What's wrong?

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,502
It was about who'd live the longest.

49
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,546
What? What did she say?

50
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,214
Hey, Chan-young.

51
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,384
Hold our funerals before you die.

52
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:01,890
Sometimes, I really want to know
what's in her head.

53
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,392
What's in that head of yours?
What did you just do?

54
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,894
I'm so grateful.

55
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,355
I wasn't planning to live that long.

56
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,066
-But she just granted me longevity, right?
-Yes.

57
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,693
-Lucky you.
-I'm so thankful.

58
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,695
-You're welcome.
-I can't thank you enough.

59
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,614
I should give you a gift. Here.

60
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,781
Here you go.

61
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,825
Come on!

62
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,996
SOMETHING I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF

63
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,541
EPISODE 3

64
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,634
Mi-jo.

65
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,178
Did you drive here?

66
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,805
-Give me the keys.
-Move.

67
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,308
You're all over the place right now.

68
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,019
You've been wearing that all day.

69
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,734
I won't ask any questions,

70
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,028
so let me just drive you.

71
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,112
The keys.

72
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,833
You can't drive in this state.

73
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,512
I'm going to kill you.

74
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,182
I will kill you…

75
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,437
if you can't save Chan-young.

76
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,749
CALLS
CHAN-YOUNG

77
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,929
Please pull up here.

78
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,639
I can drive now.

79
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,642
Tell me where you're going.

80
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,394
Consider me your driver.

81
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,189
If you don't, I'll follow you in a taxi.

82
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,154
I'm going to see my friend.

83
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,324
Give me the address.

84
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,820
Call a chauffeur service when you go home.

85
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,280
-Or--
-Thank you.

86
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,199
You can go.

87
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,510
JIN-SEOK

88
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,181
That's my husband, right?

89
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,143
Why are you here?

90
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,978
When will you stop seeing him?

91
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,025
I'm sure you know what I mean.

92
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,863
What he and I have…

93
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,034
is not what you think.

94
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,369
I hope so.

95
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,705
Ms. Jeong.

96
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,752
Seeing you around him

97
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,838
bothers me now.

98
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,801
Can you not run this place

99
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,636
without coaching his actors?

100
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,431
Is that why you're always around?

101
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,641
It's not like that.

102
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,477
That's even stranger.
If that's not the case,

103
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,105
why can't you leave his side?

104
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,441
Did he promise you something?

105
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm afraid I don't understand.

106
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,236
For example,

107
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,489
did he promise a share of his assets?

108
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,663
There's nothing like that.

109
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,209
-Jin-seok is--
-Don't address him like that.

110
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,878
It makes me very uncomfortable.

111
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,841
Mr. Kim…

112
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,679
has never been unfaithful to you.

113
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,389
So you can rest assured

114
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,643
-and go back home.
-That wasn't my question.

115
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,606
You. Who exactly are you?

116
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,234
Why are you doing this?
You said it wasn't about the money.

117
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,696
I see you growing old next to him.

118
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,202
How are you two…

119
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,373
suffocating me and being so barefaced?

120
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,542
-Please stop.
-Why are you dodging my question?

121
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,963
I'm asking how you feel toward my husband.

122
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,134
Do you think I was
in the dark all this time?

123
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,347
You're pathetic.

124
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,142
This isn't something
you need to get upset over.

125
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,228
If you're lonely…

126
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,481
shouldn't you find
someone who isn't married?

127
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,317
Why are you being so pathetic?

128
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,693
Hey!

129
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,241
-Mi-jo.
-What? Pathetic?

130
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,117
If she's lonely?

131
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,911
What are you doing?

132
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,121
Mi-jo, watch your choice of words.

133
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,332
You're the one who ran your mouth first.

134
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,584
-Hey.
-This is none of your concern.

135
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,794
Neither is it yours.

136
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,462
How dare you?

137
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,006
What gives you the right
to talk to her like that?

138
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,716
You should leave. Okay?

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,718
Apologize. Apologize to her.

140
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,262
Mi-jo, stop it!

141
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,847
She's old enough to know better.

142
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,224
Life is short.

143
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,310
She should be a decent human being
for the remainder of her life.

144
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,899
You better shut that mouth of yours.

145
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,278
Are you going to continue
being his mistress?

146
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,030
Won't you be embarrassed when you die?

147
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,164
You'll pay for this.

148
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,054
I've been assaulted. Please come here.

149
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,264
Seon-ju.

150
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,640
Can you track my phone?

151
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,351
Assault?

152
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,730
That was barely anything.

153
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,191
-Mi-jo, what's wrong with you?
-Are you crazy?

154
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,027
-Let go of me!
-Stop it!

155
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,528
You're crazy!

156
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,196
You were slapped first.

157
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,406
So you called us,
and she grabbed your hair.

158
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,075
Is that correct?

159
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,493
Yes.

160
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,078
Officer.

161
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,080
There was a misunderstanding.

162
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,415
She took it the wrong way.

163
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,458
May I leave now?

164
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,168
Did you assault her?

165
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,713
It was because she deserved it.

166
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,340
Hey. Can you please?

167
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
My attorney will send you
my medical report.

168
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,223
I won't settle.

169
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,075
JIN-SEOK

170
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,643
Hey.

171
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,186
What, you brat?

172
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,985
Where did she go?

173
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,611
To the hospital.

174
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,238
She's getting a medical report.

175
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,330
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

176
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,426
Mi-jo.

177
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,428
What's going on with you today?

178
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,804
Get lost.

179
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,528
Mi-jo.

180
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,280
Mi-jo.

181
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,199
Mi-jo.

182
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,627
Dr. Kim?

183
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,712
Hello. How are you?

184
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,591
I think I know
the answer to that question.

185
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,886
Why are you here?

186
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,554
It's a long story.

187
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,016
Mi-jo wasn't doing well,
so he had followed her.

188
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,437
She just went all out, didn't she?

189
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,191
Please don't misunderstand.

190
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,110
She's not normally like this.

191
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,155
Of course not. I know that very well.

192
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,492
You should go.

193
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,202
Go talk with your wife.

194
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,621
She's seeing red right now.

195
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,122
What about you?

196
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,290
Come on.

197
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,090
Let's focus on what's more urgent.

198
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,551
Okay. I'll call you later.

199
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,135
Goodbye.

200
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,560
Pick up, okay?

201
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,488
Are you a good drinker?

202
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,243
I can drink.

203
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,173
The medical report?

204
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,011
That was quick.

205
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,263
Chan-young must've told you.

206
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,062
Drop the charges.

207
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,442
I'm going to
your friend's hospital tomorrow.

208
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,861
I need a good medical report

209
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,155
to teach Mi-jo a lesson.

210
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,448
What did you do to her?

211
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,909
Why did she slap you?

212
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,869
Are you saying I deserved it?

213
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,203
Are you?

214
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,538
Answer my question.

215
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,748
Keep this up,

216
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,083
and I won't drop the charges.

217
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,219
Do you think I'm putting up
with you out of ignorance?

218
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,223
What do you mean?

219
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,934
Are you afraid of what I might know?

220
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,101
Don't joke with me.

221
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,937
I wish I was.

222
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,023
This is a warning. Drop it.

223
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,875
Hey.

224
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,379
Did something happen at the clinic?

225
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,632
But then again,

226
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,343
she wouldn't be like that
even if something did.

227
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,304
I don't know what's going on,

228
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,182
but I'm worried about Mi-jo.

229
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,935
Even her sister didn't know.

230
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,896
I'll ask her calmly.

231
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,814
Okay.

232
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,612
Could you let me know too?

233
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,574
Are you guys already in a relationship?

234
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,705
No, not really. Not yet.

235
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,792
Well…

236
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,548
Can't you act like a homme fatale?

237
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,507
Sorry?

238
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,592
Your name is Kim Seon-u, right?

239
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,012
Yes.

240
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:57,266
Can you sweep her off her feet
by being a homme fatale

241
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,269
and make her stay here?

242
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,604
Overseas golfing is absurd.

243
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,067
I'd love to do my best.

244
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,242
My name is Chan-young. Jeong Chan-young.

245
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,661
Jeong Chan-young. I see.

246
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,664
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

247
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,217
Hey, Chan-young.

248
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,928
Hold our funerals before you die.

249
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,057
Gosh.

250
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,892
I'm so grateful.

251
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,688
She just granted me longevity, right?

252
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,402
You lost at rock, paper, scissors.

253
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,072
What an idiot.

254
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,518
You're all done.

255
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,367
Dr. Cha, please come to room two.

256
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,578
Right.

257
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,751
Come here.

258
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,380
What's wrong, my baby sister?

259
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,301
Mi-hyeon, I'm acting
a bit strange today, aren't I?

260
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,099
What's going on?

261
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,019
I'm just having a tough time.

262
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,022
How about dinner together?

263
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,317
I have to go somewhere.

264
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,715
STAGE 4 PANCREATIC CANCER

265
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,349
PANCREATIC CANCER, HOPEFUL SIGNS
THAT IT IS NOT A FATAL DISEASE

266
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,568
TTEOKBOKKI

267
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,199
I hear you like spicy food.

268
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,493
Their spicy tteokbokki is really hot.

269
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,996
That's why I got the moderate one.

270
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,207
Are you good with spicy food?

271
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,127
You could say I'm average.

272
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,171
Here. Have some.

273
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,799
Let's eat.

274
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,873
Stop eating. You look ridiculous.

275
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,833
If I can comfort you

276
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,672
by sacrificing my stomach,
then I'll gladly…

277
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,306
Gosh. I think I'm the one
who needs comfort. This is spicy.

278
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,731
I must've startled you yesterday.

279
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:16,984
You did.

280
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,278
What's wrong?

281
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,075
I thought, "What could make
someone our age that sad?"

282
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,913
"Jin-seok must've done
something wrong big time."

283
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,918
I'm the one to blame.

284
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:42,217
I heard you say something
about saving Chan-young.

285
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,139
I'll stop asking.

286
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,351
I want to buy my sister a gift,

287
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,061
but I don't know what to get.

288
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,606
How old is she again?

289
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,484
Twenty-nine.
What did you like at that age?

290
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,782
My friends.

291
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,662
I'm more unsure now.

292
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,848
MI-JO

293
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,351
Hey.

294
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,811
Where are you?

295
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,314
I'm on my way to Yangpyeong. What's up?

296
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,024
Why suddenly?

297
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,485
My mom called.

298
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,698
Once she gives me an earful,
she won't nag me for a few months.

299
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,576
I see. When are you coming back?

300
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,453
Tomorrow. Why?

301
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,541
No reason.
I had no one to eat dinner with.

302
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,545
Call me when you get back.

303
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:25,570
JEONG'S KITCHEN

304
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,784
Thank you.

305
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,709
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

306
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,378
Thank you. Goodbye.

307
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,845
You're going to be 40 soon.
What are you going to do?

308
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,180
Well…

309
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,391
I'm doing well enough.

310
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,477
I see. Do you call being old
and single "doing well"?

311
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,354
Goodness.

312
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:03,233
You're going to make her
lose her appetite.

313
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,277
Care for a drink?

314
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:09,072
-That'd be great.
-Gosh. You guys are impossible.

315
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,785
I promise to do everything
except for getting married.

316
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,246
When you two grow old,

317
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,206
I'll do everything to take care of you.

318
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,749
I'll be in a retirement home.

319
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,001
What?

320
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,212
I'm going to live with Chan-young
and let her drive me around.

321
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:25,922
Here you go.

322
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,717
-Sure.
-Unbelievable.

323
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,969
Gosh, this smells amazing.

324
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,680
Cheers, Dad.

325
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,349
-All right.
-Gosh.

326
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,809
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

327
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,118
What? Mi-jo.

328
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,802
Did you have dinner?

329
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,471
Yes. What about you?

330
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,890
I was so busy today.

331
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,851
You should still have some.
It's really good.

332
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,236
Here.

333
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,286
What's the occasion?

334
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,830
I just missed you.

335
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,711
I'm serious.

336
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,759
You and Chan-young fought, right?

337
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,971
Did she say something?

338
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,765
No. Your face says it all.

339
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,228
I fought…

340
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,065
with Jin-seok's wife.

341
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:07,983
What?

342
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,277
I grabbed her by the hair.

343
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,611
You did?

344
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,364
Not Chan-young, but you?

345
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,284
Yes. I was furious.

346
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,868
Why would you…

347
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,829
You're not the type to…

348
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,539
Why?

349
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,835
She was running her mouth.

350
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,421
Where? With whom?

351
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,673
Did you, Chan-young, and that woman meet?

352
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,720
I went to Chan-young's studio,
and she was there.

353
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,264
I overheard them talking.

354
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,891
And that lunatic was spewing nonsense.

355
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,728
And Chan-young,
that idiot, just took it all.

356
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,982
She's only tough in front of us.
What an idiot.

357
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,027
You have a foul mouth today.

358
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,864
What did she say
for you to grab her by the hair?

359
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,073
I slapped her too.

360
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,159
It left a mark on her face.

361
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,454
You're crazy. Mi-jo, you're insane.

362
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,705
And she did nothing?

363
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,957
She called the cops and I was questioned.

364
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,710
When?

365
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,671
When in the world did this happen?

366
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,965
Yesterday. Last night.

367
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,633
No way.

368
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,012
Will you get arrested?

369
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,973
Jin-seok must've dissuaded her.

370
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,224
Everything was settled.

371
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,062
Oh, my gosh.

372
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,236
What did she say to make you so enraged?

373
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,077
"Life is short."

374
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,995
"You're so pathetic."

375
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,831
She kept running her mouth.

376
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,585
Maybe it looked pathetic in her eyes.

377
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,922
But still, she crossed the line a little.

378
00:27:55,632 --> 00:28:00,512
But was that harsh enough
for you to do those things to her?

379
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,722
"Life is short."

380
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,101
How dare she say that?

381
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,231
That's why you were infuriated?
Not because of the "pathetic" part?

382
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,566
Doesn't the latter anger you more?

383
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,239
She doesn't know what the future holds.

384
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,492
You must be hungry. Have mine too.

385
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,077
Okay.

386
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,550
Joo-hee.

387
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,176
Let's take a rest here.

388
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,595
My legs are giving out.

389
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,890
Look at you.
How will you golf in that state?

390
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,945
-Joo-hee.
-Yes?

391
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,822
One minute.

392
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,702
Hey, Mom.

393
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,912
I didn't forget.
I'll go with you tomorrow.

394
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,581
I'm free in the morning.

395
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,376
Don't worry about it.

396
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,212
Okay. Let's talk more at home.

397
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,297
Bye.

398
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,049
Gosh.

399
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,468
What is it?

400
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,386
Her medical checkup is tomorrow,

401
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,888
and she wants to go alone.

402
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,476
I see. She's getting her checkup tomorrow.

403
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,854
You know what?

404
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,025
I get very nervous
whenever I go to the hospital with her

405
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,735
in case the cancer came back.

406
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,821
The surgery was a success.

407
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,033
And these days, you can cure all types of…

408
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,038
Is something going on?

409
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,749
No.

410
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,668
Why do I feel so drowsy all of a sudden?

411
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,753
Let's go.

412
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,887
I'll feel hurt
if you're hiding something from me.

413
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,682
It's not like that.

414
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,851
When is her checkup?

415
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,230
In the morning. It won't take long.

416
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,531
Excuse me. I'd like this one.

417
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,865
One minute, please.

418
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,036
-This one.
-Okay.

419
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,922
-Hello?
-Seon-u.

420
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,716
What? Hey, So-won.

421
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,510
Did you have a drink?

422
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,554
Yes, I did.

423
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,058
I'm having a get-together
with my coworkers.

424
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,393
Really?

425
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,521
I was going to stop by. I didn't know.

426
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,439
What? What for?

427
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,485
I bought a watch for you.

428
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,362
What? Really?

429
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,741
I know you have poor taste.

430
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,493
Are you sure it's pretty?

431
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,748
You underestimate me too much.
I have an aesthetic sense too.

432
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,334
I'll be the judge.

433
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,128
I'll see if it's pretty or not.

434
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,716
Seon-u, I need to go back inside.
I'll call you again tomorrow.

435
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,510
Okay.

436
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,762
Bye.

437
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,141
Okay. I'll take a cab.

438
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,393
Bye.

439
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,036
Jane, hurry back inside.
They're looking for you.

440
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,301
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

441
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,385
My pleasure.

442
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,477
I get anxious when you call me
at this hour. Are you drunk again?

443
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,145
Not even. The night's still young.

444
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,023
Take care of your liver.
Why did you call me?

445
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,234
I just called to say hi.

446
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,529
By the way,
it's about your sister, So-won.

447
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,032
-What about her?
-How is she?

448
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,659
What's she up to?

449
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,370
She teaches at a piano academy
and goes to orchestra auditions.

450
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,998
Really? Let me know
if our pretty So-won gets a boyfriend.

451
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,583
I'll take care of him.

452
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,710
What's it to you? Why would you do that?

453
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,587
She's my first love, you bastard.

454
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,340
Well, I won't allow it.

455
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,449
Excuse me.

456
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,535
I'd like another bottle, please.

457
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,370
I'll get it.

458
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,176
Will you be okay?

459
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,557
Me? Why do you ask?

460
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,685
Can I not have expensive drinks?

461
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,813
That's not what I meant.
You look quite drunk.

462
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,939
What's wrong?

463
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,736
Right. It's closing time, isn't it?

464
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,239
Well, that too.

465
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,700
But this is really strong.

466
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,701
Come on.

467
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,706
You need to take responsibility
and take care of me.

468
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,915
Sorry?

469
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,878
I mean, the owner
of the dried pollack restaurant.

470
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,422
I mean, that restaurant…

471
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,884
I was able to drink

472
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,929
and cry there in peace
without my mom knowing, you know?

473
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,434
But you opened this restaurant here.

474
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,729
There's a Chinatown in Incheon.

475
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,524
Why did you make one here as well?

476
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,901
What kind of China…

477
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,403
China…

478
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,074
Chan-young and Mi-jo…

479
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,285
We went to Chinatown in Incheon

480
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,079
and had tangsuyuk.

481
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,165
Hello?

482
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,210
We're that close,

483
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,461
but she just won't talk.

484
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,506
I must look…

485
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,217
so weak in her eyes.

486
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,261
I mean…

487
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:02,391
Her eyes tell me
that something is going on.

488
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,271
But she just won't tell me what it is.

489
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,116
JIN-SEOK

490
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,785
Hey.

491
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,537
Are you at Mi-jo's clinic?

492
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,208
No. But I'm nearby.

493
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,503
I'm sorry,
but can you check if she's there?

494
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,219
I don't think she's there.

495
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,971
Bye.

496
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,129
You haven't left yet?

497
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,007
No, well…

498
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,344
Do you want to drink something sweet?

499
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,679
It's okay.

500
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,604
Maybe something cold and sweet.

501
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,399
Let's go.

502
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,658
Why did you come back to the clinic?

503
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,869
You must have no friends.

504
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,206
Just call me Seon-u.

505
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,583
I was eating nearby

506
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,461
because I got hungry
after buying a gift for my sister.

507
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,465
Then Jin-seok called and asked
if you were still at the clinic.

508
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,926
I could see the clinic
from the restaurant,

509
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,802
and your office was still lit.

510
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,646
I knew it.

511
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,440
I knew you'd get upset
if I told him the truth.

512
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,358
So?

513
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,777
I said you weren't there.

514
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,991
I'm dying to know.

515
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,207
I can't find a solution.

516
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,002
And I don't know
where to go to find comfort.

517
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,880
Neither my home nor my clinic

518
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,050
feels like home.

519
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,393
When I share my troubles
with someone unrelated…

520
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,812
In this situation,
it'd be someone like me.

521
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,273
It helps lift a burden off my chest.

522
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,284
What do you do when you're frustrated?

523
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,705
Do you have sneakers at the clinic?

524
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,797
Check, please.

525
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,007
Okay.

526
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,475
Throw away the receipt.

527
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,810
Okay.

528
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,228
FOOD WASTE DISPOSAL CARD

529
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,106
Excuse me. Wait…

530
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,253
Excuse me.

531
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,214
Hey. Hello?

532
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,676
What?

533
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,725
What's going on? Why are you here?

534
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,268
This isn't right.

535
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,395
That's mine.

536
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,189
I know.

537
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,399
It's your card,
but you can't pay with this.

538
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:21,859
Pay?

539
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,202
This is so funny.

540
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,539
That's a food waste disposal card.

541
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,583
Not a credit card.

542
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,475
How dare you.

543
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,813
Are you a thief?

544
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,357
Were you going to steal food waste?

545
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,610
I'm going to report you to the police.

546
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,323
You idiot.

547
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,662
What?

548
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,290
What was that?

549
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,468
Let's run.

550
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,640
Come on.

551
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,411
Don't you feel relieved?

552
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,250
I'm sweating barefoot
and it's uncomfortable.

553
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,837
It's so hard to be a homme fatale.

554
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:53,093
Chan-young told me
to impress you by being a homme fatale

555
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,721
so that you wouldn't go to the States.

556
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,223
You met her?

557
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,184
I have something to confess.

558
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,271
I already told you about my feelings.
This is something else.

559
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,940
Answer my question.

560
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,568
When you were
at the police station yesterday,

561
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,736
I was there too.

562
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,081
I really showed you everything.

563
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,504
You disappeared out of nowhere
then reappeared with your gown on.

564
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,257
Then you grabbed Jin-seok by the collar.

565
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,717
You looked really anxious.

566
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,469
I couldn't leave you in that state.

567
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,846
Wasn't it strange?

568
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,599
It was sad to see.

569
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,727
We only met recently,

570
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,774
but I could tell that
you weren't being yourself.

571
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,071
I was worried about you.

572
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,871
Chan-young is…

573
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,211
You met my friends, right?

574
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,089
Chan-young and Joo-hee.

575
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,260
Calling them family

576
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,054
isn't enough to describe them.

577
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,642
Since I don't know
how it feels to really have a family.

578
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,064
Anyway, those two…

579
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,067
are extremely precious

580
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,362
to me.

581
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,115
I could tell.

582
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,789
Chan-young is sick.

583
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,296
She's very sick.

584
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,013
She has stage four pancreatic cancer.

585
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,444
Goodness. That's enough.

586
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,863
Why would you sleep here and not at home?

587
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,531
Tomorrow morning will be hectic.

588
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,200
Sleeping here is more convenient.

589
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,994
Come here and lie down. Come on.

590
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,583
I came after a while, and this is…

591
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,669
Gosh, my back hurts.

592
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,129
What? Should I bring some cushions?

593
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,923
You should treat me better

594
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,300
not our terrible daughter
who's still single.

595
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,220
-Dad, let's sleep in another room.
-What?

596
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,846
Let's hit the sack.

597
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,432
She's right. Let's just hit the sack.

598
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,187
Why is your face so dry?

599
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,481
-Goodness. You can't hide your age.
-What?

600
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,566
We should've married her off
in her thirties.

601
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,568
Look at her now. She'll be 40 soon.

602
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,905
Mom, people ask me if I'm in my twenties.

603
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,740
-Don't be absurd.
-Twenties?

604
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,283
Do you really believe that?

605
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,869
-Why would you…
-Why did you slap me?

606
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,580
She's so violent.

607
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,582
Dad, you should get a divorce.

608
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,334
Come on. It's too late for that.

609
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,130
Dad, Seoul is teeming
with beautiful single ladies.

610
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,256
Should I hook you up?

611
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,093
Come on.
This restaurant is under her name,

612
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,803
and so are our house and the land.

613
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,888
It'll be my loss.

614
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,933
-You should demand alimony.
-What?

615
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,602
Are you guys going to sleep in the car?

616
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,691
Right. Goodness.

617
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,401
-Gosh.
-Let's go to bed.

618
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,154
People get married in their forties too.

619
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,407
Why are you working

620
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,909
if you're not going
to spend money on your appearance?

621
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,328
Whatever. I don't care.

622
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,289
I'm going to live with you forever.

623
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,999
-What?
-We'll grow old together.

624
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,626
-Hey! Do you want to get slapped again?
-Darn it.

625
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,296
-Go to bed already.
-Go to bed.

626
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,089
Good night, everyone.

627
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,216
Honey.

628
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,259
-What?
-Dad.

629
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,510
-The lights.
-The lights.

630
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,519
I need to go outside
to turn the lights off.

631
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,948
I was the first to find out.

632
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,079
I had to tell her about it.

633
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,002
Normally, I'm pretty good with words.

634
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,759
But I had no idea what to say to her.

635
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,057
This is bad.

636
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,143
I don't have the guts
to look her in the eye.

637
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,855
And I'm venting at all the wrong people.

638
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,568
Chan-young and Jin-seok…

639
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,863
must have a special relationship.

640
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,284
Why do you say that?
What did he say to you?

641
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,203
That she's his mistress? Is that it?

642
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,710
I put two and two together.

643
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,671
Chan-young and Jin-seok.

644
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,590
Jin-seok's wife
and Chan-young's best friend.

645
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,555
Their relationship isn't
what you think it is.

646
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,515
Those two

647
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,226
have had a long…

648
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,147
What's the point?

649
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,318
He already has a family of his own.

650
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,655
Knowing this makes me even more worried

651
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,366
about both you and Chan-young.

652
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,412
Does Jin-seok know about Chan-young?

653
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,540
No.

654
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,168
I'm avoiding him in case he asks.

655
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,963
She should be the first to know.

656
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,508
Right.

657
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,802
How will you tell her?

658
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,765
I don't know.

659
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,851
Goodness.

660
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,564
This must be so hard for you.

661
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,317
This is really bad.

662
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,946
I wish this could all end

663
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,033
with just me being in pain.

664
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,535
I mean that.

665
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,965
Let's go.

666
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,593
All the running has tired me out.

667
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,990
Oh, right. The peonies are beautiful.

668
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,327
I know this sounds childish,

669
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,664
but you shouldn't forget
why I got them for you.

670
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,000
Your confession?

671
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,753
I can do it again.

672
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,674
What sad timing.

673
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,594
Don't do that.
I don't think it's the right time.

674
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,668
My head hurts.

675
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,589
Goodness.

676
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,843
You're unbelievable.

677
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,223
I'm just really tired, Mom.

678
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,070
Other homes stock up on cold medicine,

679
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,197
but we stock up on hangover drinks.

680
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,200
I'm never drinking like that again.
I need to come to my senses.

681
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,827
As if you will.

682
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,037
Why do you drink so much?

683
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,874
I'm impressed that you always come home.

684
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,710
Where did you drink so much?

685
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,837
Last night?

686
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,256
I was at…

687
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,806
-Oh, no.
-Gosh.

688
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,517
Hurry up and eat.
We're going to be late for my checkup.

689
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,935
I said I'd go alone.

690
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,272
I'm done eating.

691
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,316
Darn it.

692
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,778
I must be crazy.

693
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,419
How late did I drink?

694
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,047
I didn't even pay.

695
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,675
Wait. I remember giving him my card.

696
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,806
I think I asked him
to throw away the receipt.

697
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,644
FOOD WASTE DISPOSAL CARD

698
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,314
Was it you?

699
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,737
Goodness.

700
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,203
Hurry up.

701
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,628
-I need to go now.
-Don't skip your meals.

702
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,547
Make sure you eat on time.

703
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,966
Of course. Look at all
the food Mom packed for me.

704
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,343
Don't just shove them in the fridge

705
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,388
-and forget to eat them.
-Okay. Fine.

706
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,223
-Go now.
-They're getting on. Go.

707
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,724
-I should go.
-Go.

708
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,269
-Go home.
-Get on first.

709
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,812
Hurry.

710
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,230
Okay. Bye.

711
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,576
Dad. Go.

712
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,952
Okay.

713
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,999
What is that?

714
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,126
Goodness.

715
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,404
Call me when you arrive in Seoul.

716
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,205
Hey, what's up?

717
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,583
What are you doing this evening?

718
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,170
You must really have no one
to eat dinner with.

719
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,924
Oh, right. Did she settle it with you?

720
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,926
I'll tell you when we meet.

721
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,680
I won't bring you food
if you go to prison.

722
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,768
I see. Everything's good.

723
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,812
They're within the normal range.

724
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,608
Continue taking your medication

725
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,360
and eating on time.

726
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,694
What about light exercise?

727
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:03,490
Yoga. I do yoga.
I also hike every now and then.

728
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,158
You're doing well.

729
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:08,078
We'll meet again in three months.

730
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,913
-Okay.
-Okay.

731
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,998
Thank you, ma'am.

732
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,668
Don't worry.

733
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,353
I can do it.

734
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,150
I can quit.

735
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,864
JIN-SEOK

736
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,115
Chan-young.

737
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,785
Chan-young.

738
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,673
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

739
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,896
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

740
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,157
Here you go.

741
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,242
Enjoy.

742
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,184
Right. You told me
to throw away the receipt.

743
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,269
Right?

744
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,732
Right. I'm sorry…

745
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,527
-about yesterday.
-Are you?

746
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,071
Exactly what are you sorry about?

747
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,156
Well…

748
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,743
I'm sorry for making you stay late
and paying today.

749
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,580
Thanks to you,
I closed the restaurant at 2 a.m.

750
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,373
Do you see these dark circles?

751
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,417
I'm still so exhausted.

752
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,852
I understand that the provider
of your comfort food is no longer here.

753
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,229
But it was no way to treat
the new owner and chef.

754
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,315
We're all working hard to make ends meet.

755
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,525
Right. I agree.

756
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,448
I'm only letting it go
since you live near here.

757
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,451
It seems you're older than me.

758
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,831
Well, since you remind me
of my eldest sister…

759
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,710
How old is she?

760
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,631
She's 42.

761
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,591
I'm not that old.

762
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,388
I see.

763
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,434
In that case, I apologize.

764
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,063
How about some jjajangmyeon?

765
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,609
It's lunchtime.

766
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,027
How about a bowl?

767
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,988
The customer service here
isn't that great.

768
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,657
I like jjamppong.

769
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,075
I see.

770
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,829
Jjamppong is nice too. Jjamppong…

771
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,918
Let's see if your business thrives.

772
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,169
Your eldest sister?

773
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,338
Did he have to say that?

774
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,757
He treats his customers terribly.

775
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,009
Jjamppong.

776
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,390
She's that nuisance from yesterday, right?

777
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,520
Why does it feel like I lost?

778
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,566
I don't think you should have said
"eldest sister."

779
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,734
How old did she look?

780
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,862
At most, 37 years old?

781
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,364
Thirty-seven?

782
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,203
I made a mistake.

783
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,500
Why did I say 42?

784
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,899
Did you have to avoid me?

785
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,986
Did you think you could hide
after what you did?

786
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,113
I'm busy too.

787
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,616
You can't barge in here like this.

788
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,367
It's lunchtime.

789
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,869
Let's talk over some food.

790
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,704
Next time.

791
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,705
Mi-jo.

792
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,542
Hey.

793
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,045
Hey.

794
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,841
You brought sandwiches.
Is there one for me?

795
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,051
No, there are only two.

796
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,803
I'm hurt. You knew I'd be here.

797
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,014
You can have mine. I'm not hungry.

798
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,101
You can have both of them.

799
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,853
Wait. Jin-seok.

800
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,189
I don't know what it's about,

801
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,400
but I've been close enough to watch her.

802
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:58,363
I don't think it's the right time.
Let's give her some time.

803
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,531
Okay. Did she say anything?

804
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,910
Not really.

805
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,717
You startled me.

806
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,348
I'm not that ugly, am I?

807
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,894
Jin-seok left.

808
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:37,235
Do you see that snack bar?
They have good food.

809
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,403
Let's have lunch.

810
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,364
I'm not hungry.

811
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,451
Look at you.

812
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,953
When my mother was ill,

813
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,164
my sister and I did our best
to take care of her.

814
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,127
You need to eat well
if you want to nurse someone.

815
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,878
It's a long battle, you know?

816
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,089
If I eat…

817
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,842
I think I'll have indigestion.

818
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,974
Are you going to meet Chan-young today?

819
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:11,978
Yes.

820
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,564
Should I drive you?

821
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,024
It's okay.

822
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,944
You're a doctor, not a driver.

823
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,614
You better not end up
at the police station again.

824
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,869
I have no energy to fight.

825
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,079
What are those for?

826
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,373
These?

827
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,543
I buy flowers often lately, right?

828
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,628
It's awkward for me too.

829
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,884
Should we go inside?

830
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,343
You can go first.

831
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,142
Hurry up, or you'll get freckles out here.

832
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,885
This is colorful.

833
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,346
I'm doing my best.

834
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,432
Those who get bad grades
in school highlight everything.

835
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,186
You should know what's important
and not highlight everything.

836
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,022
This reminds me of my English textbooks.

837
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,565
Were you that bad?

838
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,734
Not as bad as you right now.

839
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,156
Hey.

840
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,493
Hey. I came too early, didn't I?

841
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,745
Since your friend is here,
can we call it a day?

842
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,122
No. You're not done yet.

843
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,375
Can you wait a bit?

844
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,335
No, I'll wait at the café across--

845
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,587
No. Sit here for a minute.

846
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,297
If she can't do it in front of you,

847
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,882
she'll never be able to act well.

848
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,717
-Don't you agree?
-Yes.

849
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,015
"You gave me your heart,
and there's only one of it."

850
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,600
"It has your warmth."

851
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,519
"I only have one heart,

852
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,813
so I can give you no warmth."

853
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,233
"You can be cold and halfhearted."

854
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,819
You're the one who's acting halfheartedly.

855
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,155
You should analyze
your character before auditioning.

856
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,491
Let's see.

857
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:37,248
Look. Hyeon-u is talking coldly
throughout the entire scene.

858
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,877
-You did well.
-Okay.

859
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,337
But exaggerate a bit more.

860
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,340
-Exaggerate?
-So let's say…

861
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,800
Okay. Face me.

862
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:14,452
Do you want something to drink?
I have beer in the fridge.

863
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,369
I'll pass.

864
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,496
I won't.

865
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,831
You shouldn't drink either.

866
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,001
Who are you to tell me

867
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,045
not to drink when I bought it?

868
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,797
We should cut down on alcohol.

869
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,550
Do you have herbal tea?

870
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,844
I should've bought some.

871
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,765
Don't your students bring anything?

872
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:38,100
There are many types
of healthy teas these days.

873
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,062
I'll send you some next time.

874
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,148
Better yet, I'll go buy some now.
It's nearby.

875
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,316
What are you doing?

876
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,322
Or do you have any tea bags?

877
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,866
Where's the office pantry?

878
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,828
Where can I boil the water?

879
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,121
Maybe a pot…

880
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,582
Does the water purifier…

881
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,876
have hot water?

882
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,928
I'm saying we should be elegant
and have some tea.

883
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:15,805
"Elegant"?

884
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,893
You've been acting strange
since yesterday.

885
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,022
Actually, it's been two days.

886
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,555
CALLS
CHAN-YOUNG

887
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:10,443
SEON-JU

888
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,576
Let me apologize
for what I did. I'm sorry.

889
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,539
You're putting me first
in this situation as well?

890
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,837
Not everything I said was a confession.

891
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,056
She can change now.

892
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,099
Let's have her in black this time.

893
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,101
Hey.

894
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,146
Hey.

895
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,565
Why aren't you answering me?

896
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,317
Have you gone deaf? Seon-gyeom.

897
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,818
What? When did you come here?

898
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,404
You were so bold back there.
Are you scared now?

899
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,282
You're right.

900
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,493
I really am a lunatic.

901
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,787
Why have you been…

902
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,624
acting strange these past few days?

903
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,417
I wasn't.

904
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,587
I was being myself.

905
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:16,967
Why did you do something
that was unlike you?

906
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,345
You know I'm hot-tempered.

907
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,138
But you were really short-tempered.

908
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:25,267
She could've said those things
since she was upset,

909
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,977
so why did you slap her?

910
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,898
Wasn't that the first time
you ever slapped someone?

911
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,036
They say people change

912
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:46,831
if they're dying.

913
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,502
Are you…

914
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,838
dying?

915
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,089
Chan-young, please.

916
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,340
Or…

917
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:58,634
have I…

918
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,596
messed up?

919
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,193
Chan-young.

920
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,028
I'm listening.

921
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,577
Why…

922
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,205
didn't you tell me

923
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,374
that you got a CT scan?

924
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,311
I guess it's bad.

925
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,066
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

926
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,110
What do I have?

927
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,820
You need a checkup first.

928
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:00,905
Fuck that.

929
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:04,658
Hey. You're a doctor yourself.

930
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:09,205
I'm sure there's a reason why you're
this anxious and caused that mess.

931
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,708
What is it?

932
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:17,338
Am I fucked?

933
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,510
You and your foul mouth.

934
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:26,889
That's not going to happen.

935
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,020
That's not going to happen to us.

936
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,078
Hey.

937
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,665
We're still in our thirties.

938
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,209
We still have so much left to enjoy.

939
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:14,103
We were only…

940
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,275
We were only thirty-nine.

941
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:27,241
When we encountered
this painful life-and-death situation,

942
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,035
we had barely bloomed.

943
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,746
We were only just nearing…

944
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,709
the end of our thirties.

945
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,633
I want to live a normal life
while I'm still alive.

946
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:29,553
Why do you keep implying
you're going to die?

947
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,973
That's what I want, so drop it.

948
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:36,393
Life is hard.

949
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,564
-Hey.
-Let's go.

950
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,107
Where to?

951
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,694
You need to be strong
if you want to take care of someone.

952
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,739
There's something I need to do here.

953
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,491
I'm going to take care of my friend.

954
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,827
Be the happiest terminally ill person…

955
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,581
the world has ever seen.

956
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:03,337
