1
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,195
What is she doing?

2
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,412
All right. Let's go.

3
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,464
Mi-hyeon, get in.

4
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,590
Okay.

5
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,377
It's cold outside. Wear these.

6
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,173
Put them on.

7
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,217
Let's go to my house.

8
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,680
Let's go to my house.

9
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,598
Let's live together.

10
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,393
I'll do origami for you every day.

11
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,570
She's been pestering us
every day to bring you home.

12
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,456
Why not?

13
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,584
Do you not like us?

14
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,881
How many nights?

15
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,760
After how many nights
will I be returning here?

16
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,106
How high can you count?

17
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,610
A thousand. I'm good at counting.

18
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,571
A thousand nights

19
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,489
over…

20
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,576
and over again.

21
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,371
You can stay with us
for countless thousands of nights.

22
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,543
But if you want to stay with us longer,

23
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,173
we can live together forever.

24
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,717
I promise.

25
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,062
Wear these since it's cold outside.

26
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:58,279
A THOUSAND NIGHTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN

27
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,329

00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,980
EPISODE 9

31
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,928
How embarrassing. I'm getting teary-eyed.

32
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,432
You're pretty.

33
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,768
Hello.

34
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,397
I'm sorry we had to meet like this.

35
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,484
How's your health?

36
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,487
I eat and sleep better in here.

37
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,406
How brazen of me.

38
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,033
I'm healthier now.

39
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,412
You have a beautiful name.

40
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,039
Cha Mi-jo.

41
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,666
Thank you.

42
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,543
Are you married?

43
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,843
No.

44
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,555
Why is a pretty woman like you
still single?

45
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:53,311
But then again, competent people
nowadays choose to live alone.

46
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,396
Marriage isn't everything.

47
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,232
Though I didn't have high expectations…

48
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,902
Did you get double-eyelid surgery?

49
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,447
-I expected her
-You didn't have double eyelids as a baby.

50
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,491
-to have warmer words
-Or did you?

51
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,868
to share with me.

52
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,165
What's your occupation?

53
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,044
I'm a doctor.

54
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,507
Really? Oh, my goodness.

55
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,009
I envied people whose kids became doctors.

56
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,262
But it turns out I'm one of them.
How wonderful.

57
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,057
What's your specialty?
Internal medicine? Surgery?

58
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,397
I'm so silly, aren't I?

59
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,110
Every day in here is mundane, you see.

60
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,529
I'm bored out of my mind.

61
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,241
I must be excited
since I haven't seen you in a while.

62
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,493
"In a while…"

63
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,203
What?

64
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,542
It must've been so hard
to become a doctor.

65
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,752
It's amazing you made it.

66
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,337
You must be really smart.

67
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,131
Just like me, I guess.

68
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,676
Where are you going?

69
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,264
My stomach… I have a stomachache.

70
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,393
I'm having a stomachache.

71
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,521
Wait, Mi-jo. Wait…

72
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,233
TRUSTWORTHY LAW
HAPPY YEONGWOL

73
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,652
I hope Mi-jo doesn't collapse

74
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,363
because of a panic attack.

75
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,283
I should've gone with her.

76
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,994
We should've given her relaxing pills.

77
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,081
Hey.

78
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,625
Why is she out already?

79
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,592
She doesn't look too good.

80
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,760
Did she not get to meet her?

81
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,402
Mi-jo.

82
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,362
What's wrong?

83
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,884
Mi-jo, what's wrong? Tell us.

84
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,262
Double eyelids…

85
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,850
She asked me
if I had double-eyelid surgery.

86
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,812
She couldn't remember.

87
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,398
I…

88
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,236
I was so dumbfounded, so I…

89
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,905
What are you saying?

90
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,824
Why would you talk
about double-eyelid surgery?

91
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,370
And "in a while"?

92
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,207
How could she say that?

93
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,629
Damn it. How could she put it that way?

94
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,800
Damn it.

95
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:21,978
You see…

96
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,396
-Yes, Mi-jo?
-Yes, Mi-jo?

97
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,860
I thought of various possibilities

98
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,447
before meeting her.

99
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,241
Right. You studied natural science.

100
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,952
What does that have to do with this?
Focus, will you?

101
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,871
Calculating probabilities, that's math.

102
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,832
Let's listen to her.

103
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,751
Various possibilities, and then?

104
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,130
I never imagined this.

105
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,174
The first thing she asked…

106
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,845
was why I was still single.

107
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,974
Then she said many competent people
choose to live alone nowadays.

108
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,809
People get married if they're in love.

109
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,186
Seon-u, don't make this about you.

110
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,775
She asked if I had double-eyelid surgery.

111
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,821
Do you know what's more absurd?

112
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,822
No.

113
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,375
She said she didn't remember me
having double eyelids as a baby.

114
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,920
She couldn't remember.

115
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,928
I was so flustered

116
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,140
that I couldn't say anything.

117
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,435
I didn't know what to say.

118
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,104
I was at a loss for words.

119
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,234
This was my first time meeting her.

120
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,197
I didn't remember her face.

121
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:01,077
Since I had no memories of her,
it was my first time, right?

122
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,286
Right.

123
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,871
But…

124
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,541
Take your time.

125
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,251
But? What did she say?

126
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,592
She said she was just excited.

127
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,139
Since she saw me
for the first time in a while.

128
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,354
What is this?

129
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,108
I can't even defend her.

130
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,820
"In a while"? How could she say that?

131
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,116
But from her point of view,
she already knew Mi-jo's face.

132
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,283
The baby Mi-jo.

133
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,537
So to her, it might feel like a while and…

134
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,580
Gosh. I'm talking nonsense.

135
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,666
You have been
ever since "natural science."

136
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,793
Did you have to talk about math?

137
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,254
You might as well drag calculus into this.

138
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,132
Hey, I was much better
at calculus than you were.

139
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,926
You know I couldn't take the CSAT
because my mom was ill.

140
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,886
We're talking about her biological mom.

141
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,140
Why are you bringing that up right now?

142
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,724
Focus on the subject, will you?

143
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,019
I only said that
because I wanted to comfort her.

144
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,148
-Can you buy some coffee?
-And it was you who talked about calculus.

145
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,899
How is that comforting?

146
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,401
Can you, Joo-hee?

147
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,321
She gave her up when she was two.
"Competent people choose to be single"?

148
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,491
I mean, it's not like she did anything
to make Mi-jo competent.

149
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,412
You should think
before trying to comfort--

150
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,413
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

151
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,498
Let's go to Samseong-dong.

152
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,543
-Okay. That's a good choice.
-Sure.

153
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,255
It'll take us two hours.
Take a nap. You must be tired.

154
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,425
I need to use the bathroom.

155
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,677
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

156
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,429
Go in and turn left.

157
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,098
Okay. I'm only peeing. It won't take long.

158
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,272
Why did she have to tell us
she was peeing?

159
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,026
I couldn't ask
if she had her own practice.

160
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,906
Will it be hard to find her
if she works at a university hospital?

161
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,202
I think she'll visit me again, but…

162
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,579
Just try to find her.

163
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,624
Maybe she runs her own clinic.

164
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,752
Her adoptive parents are well-off.

165
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,546
Maybe they helped her get her own clinic.

166
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,006
Yes.

167
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,051
All right. Okay.

168
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,903
You must be tired.

169
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,073
No, I'm okay.
Will you tell them about today?

170
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,702
I think it's only right that I do.

171
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,040
If I don't, I'll feel like
I'm lying to them. It's not right.

172
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,209
Take your time when telling them.

173
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,419
I'll get going.

174
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,963
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

175
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,657
What happened to your arm?

176
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,951
I just sprained it a bit.

177
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,370
-Gosh.
-Don't make such a fuss.

178
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,414
How did this happen?

179
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,041
I tripped and fell on my arm.

180
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,377
I slightly tore my ligament.

181
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,255
I'll take this off in a week.
It's not a big deal.

182
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,258
You should've called me.
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,886
I wasn't going to be
in a cast for long anyway.

184
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,803
-Gosh.
-Hey.

185
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,597
Dad.

186
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,433
I'm glad you're here. Veranda or bathroom?

187
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,059
-What?
-Where do you want to clean?

188
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,145
I'm dying here.

189
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,232
I only did the dishes and laundry,
but my legs are already giving out.

190
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,859
You don't have to do this.

191
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,069
We can do it together once I remove this.

192
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,947
There's mold in the corner of the veranda.

193
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,866
You need to pour bleach on it.

194
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,242
I'll take the bathroom.

195
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,039
Do you want to start with our bathroom?

196
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,000
You better make it squeaky clean.

197
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,170
You need to be extremely thorough
with the one in the living room.

198
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,130
Don't we need to pour bleach there too?

199
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,132
Do I need to clean both bathrooms?

200
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,009
-Then I'll take the veranda.
-Too late.

201
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,348
Mom, you should rest.

202
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,607
Where did you go today?
Did you meet with the girls?

203
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,500
-Mom.
-Yes?

204
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,460
Today…

205
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,091
we visited Mi-jo's biological mom.

206
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,098
How is Mi-jo?

207
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,893
She cried a lot.

208
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,358
It must've been tough

209
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,278
to have kept it to yourself.

210
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,155
It was, wasn't it?

211
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,324
Since…

212
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,538
you guys are so close,

213
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,793
I've been putting off
telling you about it.

214
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,838
I'm so sorry.

215
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,466
Don't be.

216
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,970
None of us blames you for it.

217
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,891
We just feel bad that you had
to carry the burden all alone.

218
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,438
You're so sweet.

219
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,606
All of you are.

220
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,153
It's okay.

221
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,655
It's all right, Mom.

222
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,242
It's okay.

223
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,335
Mom. Dad.

224
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,088
I brought braised chicken.

225
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,590
You're here too, Mi-jo.

226
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,634
Did you know Mom was hurt?

227
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,719
Yes.

228
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,345
Then why didn't you tell me?

229
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,514
I was going to.

230
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,643
How could you come home this late?
Dad and I just finished cleaning.

231
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,188
Well done. You're the best daughter.

232
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,647
Don't use the bathroom.

233
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,193
-I just finished cleaning it.
-Can't I wash my hands?

234
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,405
Hey, I'm so famished
that I'm getting dizzy.

235
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,991
-Did you get extra glass noodles?
-Gosh.

236
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,327
Don't have any. Stay in the bathroom.

237
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,165
Wonderful.

238
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,085
It looks delicious.
I haven't eaten all day.

239
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,296
What did you do
on your date with Seon-u then?

240
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,465
-You didn't eat with him?
-You went on a date?

241
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,009
Why are you here?
You should spend more time with him.

242
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,844
It wasn't a date.

243
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,472
Chan-young and Joo-hee were there too.

244
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,102
What did the four of you do together?

245
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,771
I'm genuinely curious.

246
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,857
Let's be honest.
They should've left you two alone.

247
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,942
Don't you agree?

248
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,069
Yes. You're right.

249
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,987
Where did you guys go?

250
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,572
I'm dying to know.

251
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,699
We went for a drive.

252
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,454
How meaningless.

253
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,997
You just wasted gas.

254
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,001
Mi-jo, do you have something
to discuss with us?

255
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,711
Is that why you came here so early?

256
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,257
Well, I…

257
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,598
Mi-hyeon stresses me out too much.
I came here to tell you that.

258
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,516
You crazy…

259
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:08,188
Hey, how much more love
do you expect from me? Are you insane?

260
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,441
There she goes again.
She's always like that.

261
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,112
She yells and gets all worked up
over the smallest things.

262
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,656
Look. Look at that terrifying glare.

263
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,992
How could anyone
look at their sibling like that?

264
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,244
My heart pounds whenever she does that.

265
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,455
Be nicer to your sister.
This is all because of--

266
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,083
I'm not throwing
an old maid's fit. Stop it.

267
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,459
Let's take yoga classes.

268
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,128
There's a nice place nearby.

269
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,634
Come here, Mi-jo. What did I do wrong?

270
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,637
Hey, come out to the yard.

271
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,765
Mom, it's more delicious
if you have it with cheese.

272
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,766
What?

273
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:48,979
It is.

274
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,564
I bought this, you know?

275
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,069
Mom, let me feed you.

276
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,237
Okay.

277
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,324
She acts like she bought it.

278
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,577
Where's the other drumstick?

279
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,661
Here's the cheese.

280
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,372
-Where is it?
-It's here.

281
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,626
-What?
-I told them to hide it

282
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,419
in case she'd eat it. Take it.

283
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,547
-How could you do that?
-Hurry up.

284
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,216
Hurry. I'm telling you the truth.

285
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,551
Forget it. It's mine.

286
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,223
-Have it.
-Hey.

287
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,029
Mom? Dad, you're here too?

288
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,113
-Yes.
-Yes.

289
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,158
I thought it had stopped raining,
but then it poured again.

290
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,285
I told you,
we should've brought an umbrella.

291
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,329
Your mom never listens to me.

292
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,915
Gosh, I thought it'd stop raining.

293
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,834
You should've called beforehand.

294
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,919
What?

295
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,588
What a lovely surprise!

296
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,676
We were looking for a house.

297
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,094
-What for?
-What?

298
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,264
We should live near you.

299
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,767
You can just stay with me.

300
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,938
But you have…

301
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,692
Is it because of Jin-seok?

302
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,988
See? I told you
we should just move in with her.

303
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,948
She may not want that.

304
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,366
Goodness.

305
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,202
Were you respecting
your grown daughter's privacy?

306
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,871
You're so adorable.

307
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,708
He won't come here anymore.

308
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,252
I told him not to.

309
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,714
I told him
I didn't care what he did anymore.

310
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,925
We're just going to be good friends

311
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,553
until…

312
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,353
-I bought a new car.
-What? Already?

313
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,688
Are we getting it tomorrow?

314
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,233
It's a mid-size sedan.
It's extremely comfortable to drive in.

315
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,320
Then we should visit
that department store again.

316
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,405
Let's go.

317
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,491
I guess we have to.
She won't stop pestering us.

318
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,160
Then let's just have coffee there.

319
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,453
Okay, let's.

320
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,912
Just for coffee?

321
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,456
Why not?

322
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,626
Or we can take
the escalators and look around.

323
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,881
Not you too.
We should splurge while we're there.

324
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,341
I could get a t-shirt.

325
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,389
Seon-u.

326
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,016
Yes?

327
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,436
Did he go back to the States?

328
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,104
Father?

329
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,190
Yes.

330
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,692
I'm not sure.

331
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,320
I don't know either.

332
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,700
You don't have to do this for me.

333
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,537
You'll only worsen the situation.

334
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,332
It's already as bad as it can get.

335
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,959
Still.

336
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,975
What do you do with Mi-jo?

337
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,480
Well, we golf…

338
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,733
and play games together.

339
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,985
Oh, we went camping.

340
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,238
You do many things.

341
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,994
What? No matching rings?

342
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,123
Well, it's our feelings
for each other that matters.

343
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,709
Maybe I'm still young.
I look forward to getting one.

344
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,963
I didn't want to pressure her.

345
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,215
I understand.

346
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,719
I hope you guys will eventually
get married and have wedding rings.

347
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,763
-That's nice.
-Right?

348
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,941
CREDIT UNION

349
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,237
Why did you have to drag me to the bank?

350
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,865
I'm quite busy, you know?

351
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,741
But you're jobless.

352
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,953
What? Don't hurt my feelings like that.

353
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,581
Here. I've transferred the money.

354
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,541
Please check the receipt.

355
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,297
Your savings account expired,
so I waited for you. Congratulations.

356
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,090
Thank you.

357
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,468
Here. Check it.

358
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,720
The receipt?

359
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,264
50,032,320 WON

360
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,182
What?

361
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:39,352
It was going to be your wedding gift,
but it's not happening anytime soon, so…

362
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,062
Mom, this is…

363
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,940
Why are you giving me so much money?

364
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,610
Get up. They're waiting for their turns.

365
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,947
-Thank you.
-My pleasure. See you again.

366
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,616
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

367
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,828
-Mom, sit down.
-Why?

368
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,416
What are you doing, Mom?

369
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,877
Why are you giving this money to me?

370
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,338
Spend the money however you like.

371
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,467
Your tuition would've been around
that much had you gone to college.

372
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,386
It's yours. Spend it however you want.

373
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,514
I have money saved up.
Let's transfer this money back to you.

374
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,059
Why would you give such a hefty sum to me?

375
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,061
Just keep it.

376
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,939
Spend that money
on whatever you want to do.

377
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,399
You worked for such a long time.

378
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,860
Don't think about getting another job.

379
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,781
Put it to good use.
That's what I want you to do.

380
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,329
Don't do this.

381
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,375
Why are you giving me
your hard-earned money?

382
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,755
Just keep it
and go on trips with your friends.

383
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,924
It's okay. Get up.

384
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,718
I have somewhere to go. Let's go.

385
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,887
Hurry up.

386
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,181
Gosh.

387
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,435
GOCHEOK-DONG REAL ESTATE AGENCY

388
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,898
Why are the premiums so high?

389
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:07,899
What are you doing?

390
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,611
Hey. Isn't it your day off today?

391
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,698
I'm looking for a new place.
I haven't moved yet.

392
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,659
I see. So you're moving
into this neighborhood?

393
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,744
The morning traffic is terrible,

394
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,163
and I'm too sleepy
at night to drive back home.

395
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,332
I understand.

396
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,336
What are you looking for, Ms. Jang?

397
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,672
"Ms. Jang"?

398
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,217
Don't address me like that.

399
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,885
It sounds weird.

400
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,762
Okay. Not "Ms. Jang."

401
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,848
Then…

402
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,892
-how about "Joo-hee"?
-Yes.

403
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,811
That's better.

404
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,899
I was just checking out
the current apartment prices.

405
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,236
Can you help me look for a place?

406
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,280
It won't take long.
Let's have lunch after.

407
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,197
Sure.

408
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,240
This way.

409
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,913
You cook Chinese food every day

410
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,915
and even eat Chinese on your day off.

411
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,584
You must love Chinese food.

412
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,836
This place is known for their jjajangmyeon

413
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,129
on social media.

414
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,050
I should visit all
the popular Chinese restaurants.

415
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,843
You're so hardworking.

416
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,221
What should I have?

417
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,349
Jjajangmyeon and ulmyeon.

418
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,268
Do I not get to choose?

419
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,772
They're known for those two dishes.

420
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,816
I see. So that's why you invited me.

421
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,401
It'll look sad if I eat two on my own.

422
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,988
But let's go for a drive
once we're done eating.

423
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,823
Being at work all day is suffocating.

424
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,658
Okay? Please?

425
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,619
Goodness.

426
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,420
The weather is fantastic.

427
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,339
Let's go somewhere nice and have coffee.

428
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,715
Anywhere you'd like to go?

429
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,342
Yes.

430
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,118
You should come inside
and have a cup of coffee.

431
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,494
I haven't found a place yet.

432
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,287
Let's go together after some coffee.

433
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,914
Spend some time with your friends.

434
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,333
You'll see me often once I move.

435
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,085
Spend a lot of time with Chan-young.

436
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,171
Drive safely.

437
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,215
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

438
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,148
That man has many charms.

439
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,235
You're an idiot.

440
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,487
You asked him to drive you here?

441
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,489
You guys wanted to meet up.

442
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,492
The weather was nice,
so we decided to have some coffee.

443
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,870
You should've said
you were with Hyeon-jun.

444
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,081
We just ran into each other
at the real estate agency.

445
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,876
So we had lunch together

446
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,627
and checked out some places.

447
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,422
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

448
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,299
Why did you go there? Are you moving?

449
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,302
You see…

450
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,387
My mom gave me some money.

451
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,015
She had saved 50 million won.

452
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,893
She told me to spend it however I wanted.

453
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,270
What an amazing mom.

454
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,148
She gave you money since you were sacked.

455
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,152
So what are you going to do?
Why did you go to a real estate agency?

456
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:45,158
Maybe I'll open a small shop.

457
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,618
I'm not sure yet.

458
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,130
What lovely weather.

459
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,591
What a killer view.

460
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,845
Right.

461
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,682
My mom's birthday
is just around the corner.

462
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,685
You see…

463
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,355
Objectively speaking,

464
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,900
it's her last birthday
that I'll get to see.

465
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:31,246
Exactly when will you come to your senses?

466
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,122
Do you have to remind us all the time?

467
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,708
I agree with Mi-jo. Grow up, will you?

468
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,419
If I do, things will become quite serious.

469
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,881
Are you sure
you'll be able to handle that?

470
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,844
-What should we do?
-Buffet reservation?

471
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,263
No. She doesn't like buffets.

472
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,431
Let's take her somewhere nice.

473
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,519
-We could book a nice hotel room and--
-Do that with Seon-u.

474
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,979
I'm spitballing here.

475
00:30:56,062 --> 00:31:00,066
Right. But I'll kindly refuse
such boring ideas.

476
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,234
Sure. Suit yourself.

477
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,570
How about this?

478
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:07,115
You can choose
the taste, design, and writing.

479
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,700
Aren't they pretty?

480
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,327
-Joo-hee.
-They're so pretty.

481
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,955
Send me this link.
Mi-hyeon's birthday is coming soon.

482
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,708
Hey, we were talking
about my mom's birthday.

483
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,625
Focus.

484
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,544
Right. Let me pick one out for you.

485
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,301
Who is this?

486
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,304
Hello?

487
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,388
Hello?

488
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,851
Were you surprised?

489
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,769
I got your number from Jin-seok.

490
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,522
I see.

491
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,992
I'm not as warm-hearted as your parents.

492
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,203
I'm sure you heard about So-won.

493
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,415
You must know since Seon-u is quite upset

494
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,875
because of that incident.

495
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,587
I don't know the details.

496
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,964
It bothers me.

497
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,637
I understand that
you have wonderful adoptive parents now.

498
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,056
But to have you as my daughter-in-law…

499
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,101
Do you understand what I'm getting at?

500
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,525
There are those…

501
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,740
who understand people like you.
Then there are those who can't.

502
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,283
Right?

503
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,079
-Right.
-Seon-u is my one and only child.

504
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,665
His mom passed away early.

505
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,792
All I have is him now.

506
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,004
-I see.
-You must be pretty offended.

507
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,714
I'm sorry.

508
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,343
This is a difficult topic to talk about.

509
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,012
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you…

510
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,641
to tell me this either.

511
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,062
I understand what you mean.

512
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,651
Then is it safe to say
I can return to Boston with no worries?

513
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,698
I understand

514
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,242
how you feel.

515
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,497
But I hope you could also understand

516
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,333
how Seon-u and I feel.

517
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,632
My heart…

518
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,220
belongs to me.

519
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,183
And Seon-u's belongs to him.

520
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,439
You can't blame us for falling in love.

521
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,984
Likewise…

522
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,696
I don't blame you

523
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:56,743
for being bothered
by the fact that I was adopted.

524
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,536
So you'll continue seeing him?

525
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,579
This won't be

526
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,541
the reason why we break up, at least.

527
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,012
I came here to tell you something.

528
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,140
I'm listening.

529
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,686
I first met Jin-seok

530
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,981
at a club in New York.

531
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,778
He was very intoxicated.

532
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,072
It was love at first sight.

533
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,408
He was sobbing in the hallway.

534
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,994
He was on the phone.

535
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,830
"I have no reason to live."

536
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,625
"I'm so far away,
yet all I think about is you."

537
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,377
"I'll do better. I'm sorry."

538
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,296
"Please give me another chance."

539
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,050
The moment I first met you,

540
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,843
I knew that the woman

541
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,430
on the other end of the phone call

542
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,390
was you.

543
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,227
It was clear as daylight.

544
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,732
Those words still haunt me.

545
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,443
I never heard them again.

546
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,571
But they're still on my mind.

547
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,537
I wished he said those words to me.

548
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,668
He must've not gotten
a positive reply from you

549
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,296
because he drank even more afterward.

550
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,675
Then I took him

551
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,261
to a hotel.

552
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,556
I understand what you're getting at.

553
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,269
You can stop.

554
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,104
I lied and told him I was

555
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,439
pregnant with his baby.

556
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,862
I still don't understand
why I did such a thing.

557
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:00,408
I knew he was going to find out
if he requested a blood test.

558
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,870
But I was brazen.

559
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,415
I wanted to live as his woman…

560
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,586
even if it was only for a few days.

561
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,593
But it lasted much longer than that.

562
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,681
You shouldn't have done that.

563
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,266
I know.

564
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,354
Had I not done so, you two would've…

565
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,940
No, not for my sake.

566
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,281
You shouldn't have done that to Ju-won.

567
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,835
I have a favor to ask.

568
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,421
I'm listening.

569
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,548
Please persuade Jin-seok.

570
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,884
To do what?

571
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,177
To let me take Ju-won

572
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,888
after our divorce.

573
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,185
I want a second chance.

574
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,605
I want…

575
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,277
to do my best as Ju-won's mom.

576
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,407
Tell him he can watch me.

577
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,410
And if I'm still a bad mom,

578
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,704
he can take

579
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,082
Ju-won from me.

580
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,711
I know you're going through a lot.

581
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,755
I'm sorry I'm asking this.

582
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,300
Goodbye, then.

583
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,355
Don't be too upset.

584
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,691
Because…

585
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,778
not once was I his woman.

586
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,326
You win.

587
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,685
Mi-jo.

588
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,107
-Mi-jo.
-What?

589
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,025
You're here.

590
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,069
-Did you have fun with your friends?
-Yes.

591
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,239
I see. How's Chan-young?
Is she doing okay?

592
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,533
She won't tell me.

593
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,244
But seeing her put up a brave front

594
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,204
breaks my heart.

595
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,750
Maybe I shouldn't
have asked you out on a movie date.

596
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,626
We had already made plans yesterday.

597
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,171
What should we watch?

598
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,964
-Let's find out.
-Okay.

599
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,884
Let's go. Let's see.

600
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,178
Here.

601
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,313
It bothers me.

602
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:22,318
I understand that
you have wonderful adoptive parents now.

603
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,653
But to have you as my daughter-in-law…

604
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,491
Do you understand what I'm getting at?

605
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:29,950
How's this one?

606
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,329
Sure. Let's watch this.

607
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,288
Okay.

608
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,672
You're not avoiding me, are you?

609
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,803
You better not, or else…

610
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,097
I was really busy.

611
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,601
I even met Seon-ju.

612
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,188
Imagine how busy I must have been.

613
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,986
She gave me the divorce papers.
She made up her mind.

614
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,115
Did she mention that?

615
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,158
No.

616
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,037
She told me how much she loved you.

617
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,212
You're not good-looking, though.

618
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,134
But you must have some killer charms.

619
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,802
That's enough.

620
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:33,389
We've both fallen head over heels for you.

621
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,394
What in the world are your charms?

622
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,275
It's my entire body. It's full of charms.

623
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,444
Can't you see they're overflowing?

624
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,946
Pick them up.

625
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,332
We talked about Ju-won.

626
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,086
She wants me

627
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,965
to persuade you to let her take him.

628
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,011
She knew you'd say no to her.

629
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,888
I've already made up my mind.

630
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,639
She wants another chance as his mom.

631
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,187
She said you could take him back

632
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,064
if she failed.

633
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,239
I agree with her.

634
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,992
I know you'll feel sorry for him.

635
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,913
I wish you would give her another chance.

636
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,333
Okay?

637
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,337
I really hope you do. For Ju-won's sake.

638
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,425
Okay. I'll talk with her again.

639
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,845
I'm taken aback.

640
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,098
I never thought
she'd make such a decision.

641
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,108
She's his mom after all.

642
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,991
Get the divorce after I'm gone.

643
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,376
Who knows what'll happen
after some time goes by?

644
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,259
It's freezing.

645
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,927
Isn't it?

646
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,430
Should we have some green tea?

647
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,100
She said I won.

648
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,854
She said she was never your woman.

649
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,983
I'm not trying to be kind here.

650
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,819
But…

651
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,366
I don't want to leave you all alone.

652
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,754
Hey.

653
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,799
Don't cry.

654
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,509
Come on.

655
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,262
Chan-young.

656
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,432
I don't resent anyone.

657
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,978
Not even Seon-ju.
Because it's all my fault. I was a coward.

658
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,566
I couldn't tell you
that Ju-won wasn't my real son

659
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,611
just because of my reputation
as the son of Jinsa Food's chairman.

660
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,529
"I'll tell her next time. Next year."

661
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,033
I watched you fade away
and still couldn't say anything.

662
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,743
I was such a coward.

663
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,871
I understand. I didn't mean to upset you.

664
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,081
So what if I'll be alone?

665
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,628
You were alone for over a decade,
so why would you worry about me?

666
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,712
Hey, Jin-seok--

667
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,048
So can you please stop saying that?

668
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,549
Please. Okay?

669
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,718
Every single day is so precious.

670
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,430
Going on walks and getting calls
from you are all so precious,

671
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,099
so please stop saying such things.

672
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,085
I'm sorry.

673
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,092
I was wrong.
I won't say such things anymore.

674
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,180
I won't say what I don't mean anymore.

675
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,474
Divorce her.

676
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,438
And come to me.

677
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,494
Let's stay together.

678
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,426
DERMATOLOGIST
KIM SEON-U

679
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:25,180
FATHER

680
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,153
FATHER

681
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:48,871
Yes, Father.

682
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,916
Both of you are old enough to understand,
so why are you being stubborn?

683
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,587
No one can change the fact
that you and I are a family.

684
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,131
So let's not argue over some woman.

685
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,551
Don't meet Mi-jo ever again.

686
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,138
Don't even call her.

687
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,890
Then don't give me a reason to.

688
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,891
Father.

689
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,477
When you chose the life you lived,

690
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:15,522
when you made the wrong choices,
and when people ridiculed you,

691
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,107
I was always by your side.

692
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,317
Mom too.

693
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,319
That was because

694
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,821
we were a family.

695
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,033
Like you said, we were a family

696
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,160
no matter what.

697
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:37,419
But I will no longer condone your choices.

698
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,713
Mi-jo taught me

699
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,632
that being silent was wrong.

700
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,842
That I should protect those I love.

701
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,847
She must be hurt, and I don't know
what decision she'll make.

702
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,849
But I will persuade her.

703
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,062
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life with her.

704
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:55,979
I'm sorry, Father.

705
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,858
Kim Seon-u!

706
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,986
You're also precious to me.

707
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,948
Please remember that.

708
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,457
Hello.

709
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,167
I'd like to order a birthday cake.

710
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,877
I see. One minute, please.

711
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,674
Look at these
and pick a design you'd like.

712
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,725
What would you like me to write?

713
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,978
Let's see.

714
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,315
I'll text you by the end of the day.

715
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,236
We bake the cake
the morning of to keep it fresh.

716
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,863
It'll be done by noon,
so come before then.

717
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:47,906
Okay.

718
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,703
Right. Please come by 5 p.m.
at the latest. I have plans that day.

719
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,329
Okay. I'll come before then.

720
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,581
Okay.

721
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,792
Please make it pretty.

722
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,336
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

723
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,838
Come in.

724
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,047
Let's go.

725
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,799
Is it already lunchtime?

726
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,509
It's time to go home.

727
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,052
What?

728
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,850
GENERAL MANAGER
CHA MI-HYEON

729
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,189
What's going on?

730
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,526
Why won't you believe me?

731
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,406
This is ridiculous.

732
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,660
I, the director, was the only one
who didn't know that we were closed today.

733
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,998
I asked Ms. Cha and the nurses
to clear your afternoon schedule.

734
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,250
No wonder.

735
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,420
-My afternoon schedule was empty.
-I know.

736
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,213
Why didn't they tell me?

737
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,882
What's with you guys?

738
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,637
This is ridiculous.

739
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,892
So where are we going?

740
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,018
To Gangneung.

741
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,271
What? Gangneung?

742
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,225
See? Aren't you glad we came here?

743
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,728
Doesn't the sea wash away your worries?

744
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,898
This does feel nice.

745
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,108
Did I do well?

746
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,946
But we could've come here on the weekend.

747
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,989
We didn't need to close the clinic.

748
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,491
The traffic would've been awful.

749
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,994
Let's enjoy ourselves. Come on.

750
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,136
It's so pretty here.

751
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,430
-Right?
-Yes.

752
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,855
This is Rachmaninoff.

753
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,442
Everything's perfect today.

754
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,153
I prepared all this for you.

755
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,822
Right. Sure.

756
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,201
You probably came here beforehand,
rented the entire cafe,

757
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,328
and picked out this music too.

758
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,372
Thanks.

759
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,666
I'm serious.

760
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,346
THE CAFE HAS BEEN RENTED
AND WILL OPEN AT 6 P.M.

761
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,979
Isn't it about time you believed me?
I've been planning this for a week.

762
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,273
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

763
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,650
But why?

764
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,180
What is this?

765
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,808
So this is why

766
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,310
we came all the way here.

767
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,398
I visited the jewelry store
countless times.

768
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,777
I thought you'd refuse,
saying it was childish.

769
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,280
So I didn't have the guts to buy them.

770
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,867
I know this isn't important.

771
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,452
But right now,

772
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,914
it matters a lot to me.

773
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,252
It bothers me.

774
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:57,340
I understand that
you have wonderful adoptive parents now.

775
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,801
But to have you as my daughter-in-law…

776
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,763
Do you understand what I'm getting at?

777
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,397
I'll let you know every day

778
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,776
how much I love you.

779
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:29,956
Would you…

780
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,127
still like me even if
my mother had seven priors?

781
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,380
Why would you ask me that?

782
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,342
I'm serious. I want to know.

783
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:41,801
I…

784
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,181
like you.

785
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,186
I like you for who you are.

786
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,025
I'm totally mad about you.

787
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:02,614
I get butterflies on my way to work,

788
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,450
and I feel sad when I go home.

789
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,172
There's something…

790
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,842
I need to tell you.

791
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,974
I'm sorry you had to hear those words.

792
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,771
I'm truly

793
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,232
sorry.

794
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,820
Don't be sorry.

795
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:50,495
What your father said broke my heart.

796
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,835
But that was out of your control.

797
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,629
So…

798
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,049
I'm okay.

799
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,856
Did you get the right size?

800
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,984
If you didn't,
I'm going to reconsider this.

801
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,426
It's a perfect fit.

802
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,908
It's a perfect fit.

803
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,661
It's pretty.

804
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,413
Do you like it?

805
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,956
Yes.

806
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,847
Thank you for driving today.

807
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:33,932
My pleasure.

808
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,190
Good night.

809
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,236
Don't doze off.

810
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,821
Call me when you get home.

811
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:49,989
Okay.

812
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,371
Bye.

813
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,083
Did you leave something?

814
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,836
Would you like
a cup of tea before leaving?

815
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,050
I have mugwort tea.

816
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,918
It's the first time
my heart's paced like that

817
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,170
when driving in reverse.

818
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:31,090
Look at you, a smooth-talker.
You're getting better at it.

819
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,299
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO

820
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,301
-Hello?
-It's me, your mom.

821
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,387
Sorry?

822
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,264
It's me. Your mom.

823
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,725
Are you surprised?

824
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,396
I searched your name
and found your clinic.

825
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,397
I see.

826
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,149
You should've just told me
your mobile number.

827
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,776
You left in such a hurry.

828
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,698
What's wrong?

829
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,325
Is this making you uncomfortable?

830
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,788
I'll come visit
if I ever need to talk with you.

831
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,165
What if I want to speak with you?

832
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,254
Then call the clinic.

833
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:55,633
This is so heartbreaking.
I don't even know my daughter's number.

834
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:00,680
I need to discuss this
with my parents first.

835
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,600
Why do you need
their permission when I'm your biological…

836
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,188
You're turning 40 soon.
You don't need their permission.

837
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,776
I'm with a patient right now.

838
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,529
If this isn't urgent, I'll hang up.

839
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:37,175
Which low heels are the most popular here?

840
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,177
Let's see.

841
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,430
These are low and comfortable to wear.

842
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,474
Many middle-aged women like them.

843
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,558
May I see?

844
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,643
Sure.

845
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,525
I'll take a pair in size 235mm.

846
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,320
Size 235mm. I'll get a pair.

847
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,529
Please wait here.

848
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,959
The cake. Oh, no.

849
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:13,855
Damn it.

850
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,066
It's that one.

851
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,110
Come on.

852
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,716
It's that one.

853
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,817
-Chan-young!
-Chan-young!

854
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,695
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

855
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,197
Where did you collapse?

856
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,115
Hey, what should I do?

857
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,331
It's that one.

858
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,715
It's green tea, my mom's favorite.

859
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,264
I even wrote something.

860
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,267
Damn it. This is driving me insane.

861
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,231
What should we do?

862
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,116
It's Mom.

863
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,789
Mom.

864
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,084
Sorry.

865
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,670
Something came up at work.

866
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,214
You must be hungry.

867
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,552
Well, have some seaweed soup first.

868
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,931
I'm going to be a bit late.

869
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,184
I'm sorry, Mom.

870
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,450
MOM, MOM, MOM
I LOVE YOU!

871
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,540
It's 10 p.m.

872
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,877
Her birthday will be over soon.

873
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,089
Should we buy
some snack cakes and pile them up?

874
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,133
I have no candles.

875
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,802
Right. Candles.

876
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,513
Chan-young.

877
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,223
Yes?

878
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,518
Do you desperately want that?

879
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,688
If you were me, you'd be desperate too.

880
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,276
Why did I have to faint then of all times?

881
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,321
I'm already sad about dying,

882
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,824
so why is this happening
on my mom's birthday?

883
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,372
Let's get that cake.

884
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,177
You could get a rap sheet.

885
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,304
Let's focus on one thing.
Your mom's birthday.

886
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,847
I never went to college
so I'll never be able

887
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,307
to get married if I become a convict too.

888
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,767
You should put that down.

889
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,435
But I'm the strongest one here.

890
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,521
Here we go.

891
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:50,321
One, two, three!

892
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:23,771
You should hurry.

893
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,690
What about this?

894
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,733
It's late. Just go.

895
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,403
Then I'll drop this off and come back.

896
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,697
-Okay?
-Don't. We'll take care of this. Go.

897
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,031
-Okay.
-Bye.

898
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,324
-Bye.
-Bye.

899
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:45,835
Well…

900
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,922
we need

901
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:54,093
-to take care of this.
-Right.

902
01:06:56,303 --> 01:07:00,641
But it's kind of scary, isn't it?

903
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:12,945
Mi-jo.

904
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,031
Yes?

905
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,575
Remember what you said?

906
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:22,997
You said the stars
were so pretty that it made you sad.

907
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:24,832
Yes.

908
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,084
I think I understand.

909
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,007
I wanted you to know that.

910
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:46,771
We can't see any stars in Seoul.

911
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:53,069
By the way, what should we do now?

912
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,783
We should turn ourselves in.

913
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:15,758
Hello, sir.

914
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:20,012
I called to report something.

915
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,473
Yes. Well…

916
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,851
I damaged someone's property.

917
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,144
It's not theft, right?

918
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,396
Of course not! We--

919
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,023
No, sir.

920
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,401
No, this isn't a prank call.

921
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,489
We were trying to pick up
an item we had reserved,

922
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:41,158
and we slightly damaged the glass.

923
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:44,203
The address is…

924
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,287
Here.

925
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:48,624
It's…

926
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,501
MOM, MOM, MOM
I LOVE YOU!

927
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,713
Happy birthday, Mom.

928
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,675
Were you late

929
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,636
because you were busy
getting this wonderful cake?

930
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,346
Is this really edible?

931
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:04,431
It's too pretty to eat.

932
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,852
Okay. This is your favorite,
green tea cake.

933
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,355
Look. It's green inside, right?

934
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,692
-Hold on. I'll give you a slice.
-Let's try it.

935
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,280
I'll take one. That's it.

936
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,704
It's scrumptious.

937
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,914
They're so talented.

938
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,708
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

939
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,543
Where's her gift?

940
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,545
Right.

941
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:39,550
You see, I haven't picked it up yet.

942
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:43,304
I ordered a pretty pair of heels.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

943
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,014
I see.

944
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,307
Where's your gift?

945
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:51,395
What? I was going to see
what she got you first.

946
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,772
She's getting you heels,
so how about some clothes?

947
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,399
That's a good idea.

948
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:59,069
You should stop wearing pants
and get a dress for once.

949
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,321
That's perfect, Dad.

950
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,948
No, I don't want a dress.
Just give me cash.

951
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,575
There you go again.

952
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,118
How much do you want?

953
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,915
This is so delicious.

954
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,208
Right?

955
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,918
I do smell the green tea.

956
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:17,046
If that's the case,
of course, I should settle.

957
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,883
No wonder. My heart ached

958
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,469
when I was making that cake.

959
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,722
Goodness, I had no idea.

960
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,189
-I told you not to come.
-Did you have the party?

961
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:37,107
Yes. It went well.

962
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,526
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

963
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,278
I had my reasons.

964
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,323
I'll pay for all the damages,

965
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,743
so could you please settle?

966
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,081
Of course, I will.

967
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,917
Your friend already
took care of everything.

968
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,379
-It's fine.
-She settled.

969
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,966
It was my first blind date in three years,

970
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:04,718
so I had put my phone on airplane mode.

971
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,764
You needed to focus. We're truly sorry.

972
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,724
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

973
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,563
Stay strong.

974
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,692
Sorry? Right. Thank you.

975
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,754
MENU

976
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,673
One egg soup.

977
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,260
And one clam soup. It sounds tasty.

978
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:49,513
Sure. Ma'am, one egg soup
and one clap soup, please.

979
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:50,472
And no red peppers.

980
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:51,890
Okay.

981
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,229
One spicy chicken cartilage too.

982
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,189
-Okay.
-I'm not craving anything spicy.

983
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,400
I won't have any, so help yourselves.

984
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,527
You need something spicy today.

985
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,530
Look at her drooling.

986
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,240
A bottle of soju too.

987
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,700
-No.
-No.

988
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:11,410
I won't drink any.

989
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,329
It's for Joo-hee's hard work.

990
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,340
Hey. What's this?

991
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:26,133
What?

992
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:28,052
This is…

993
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,763
Can I expect the same one
around Seon-u's finger too?

994
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:33,515
It's not a big deal.

995
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,227
-I can't believe it.
-Well done.

996
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,812
I'm so proud of you.

997
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,190
You finally got
matching rings at the age of 39.

998
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,068
Any pregnancy news?

999
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,612
I'm too exhausted
to even give a snark reply.

1000
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,281
Me too.
We should put some pain-relief patches on.

1001
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,075
We may have overused our muscles.

1002
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:52,785
Gosh, I'm sore.

1003
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,704
-Thank you.
-The food's here.

1004
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,498
Let's just have one glass.

1005
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:03,337
Chan-young will have water,
the strongest liquor.

1006
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,047
Here you go.

1007
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,593
Jeez.

1008
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:14,056
I threw a brick with the hand
that had the ring on it.

1009
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,974
Keep this from Seon-u.

1010
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,020
You're right. You should've been caressing
his face with those hands.

1011
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,481
I'm responsible for it.

1012
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,816
Let's drink!

1013
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,536
But don't you think we were so cool today?

1014
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,330
Hey, how could you call that cool?

1015
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,708
We're pretty much police station VIPs.

1016
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,127
Right.

1017
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:46,046
When her clinic was raided.

1018
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:50,050
-They ripped our hair out.
-Those ladies…

1019
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,927
Do you think they found the mistress?

1020
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,763
You didn't hear anything?
She must be from your neighborhood.

1021
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,516
I hope the couple reconciles
and lives happily together.

1022
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,892
You're concerned about them?

1023
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,853
It's just nice to bless others.

1024
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,939
I agree. I hope the cake shop owner
goes on a second date.

1025
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,442
You're right. I hope so.

1026
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,444
She was out late.
I'm pretty sure she will.

1027
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:13,031
Oh, my. Is that what
our matching-ring expert thinks?

1028
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:17,995
Yes. Based on my expertise,
I see an 80-percent chance.

1029
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,621
Eighty percent?

1030
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,248
You're truly a dating expert.

1031
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,042
"Perhaps,

1032
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,463
I'll be able to live after all."

1033
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:31,091
Days like this make me think that way.

1034
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,301
Stop it.

1035
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:33,677
Let me try it on.

1036
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,471
-Come on.
-No. You can't.

1037
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:36,722
Stay still, or you'll break it.

1038
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:41,518
I never imagined us as a group of two.

1039
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:46,106
-Give that back!
-Will Mi-jo and I

1040
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,525
-I can't take it out.
-be okay without you?

1041
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,319
-It belongs to you!
-It's not budging.

1042
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:51,653
It's yours now.

1043
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:52,821
You see,

1044
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:55,115
we even have a blast

1045
01:14:56,283 --> 01:15:00,746
over a bottle of soju
and some chicken cartilage.

1046
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:03,040
A thousand nights

1047
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,542
over…

1048
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:08,545
and over again.

1049
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,424
A thousand nights over and over.

1050
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:16,678
Please let us be together for that long.

1051
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:56,343
MOM, MOM, MOM
I LOVE YOU!

1052
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,515
Over a million views?

1053
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:04,101
This is where
the terminal patient came, right?

1054
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,686
Chan-young!

1055
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,354
-This is so embarrassing.
-There's our actress!

1056
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,983
Do you think
you became a good piano player

1057
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,985
because of your adoptive father's money?

1058
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,029
It came from your late parents.

1059
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:16,989
Who are you?

1060
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,991
You know Lee Gyeong-suk, right?

1061
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,409
Who is he?

1062
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:22,703
I've never seen her so frightened before.

1063
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:26,248
Why won't you tell me?
I always tell you everything.

1064
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:30,210
I'm also scared that things
might not be the same between us

1065
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,546
once Chan-young's gone.

1066
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,968
