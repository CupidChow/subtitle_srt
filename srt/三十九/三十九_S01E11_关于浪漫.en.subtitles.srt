00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,308
I was crazy
I was really crazy

2
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,020
I hated you so much that I let you go

3
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,690
Our love ended so easily

4
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:10,070
I knew you wouldn't come back

5
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,823
I was crazy
I was really crazy

6
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,744
I didn't even cling onto you

7
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:22,248
You left me

8
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,836
You only left behind
This short-lived memory

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,630
Hey!

10
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,341
Come on!

11
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,926
You're really driving me crazy.

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,345
How could you be so bad
at both singing and dancing?

13
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,223
Come on, Joo-hee. Be the bigger person.

14
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,100
Look how much she's aged
because of med school.

15
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,228
I'm still pretty enough
to be a Miss Universe.

00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,734
Come on. Again?

18
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,694
Why would she ruin the vibe?

19
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,948
Wasn't my song better
for celebrating her graduation?

20
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,828
-On--
-On a rainy day

21
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,371
Hey!

22
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,209
-Sit in an old coffee shop
-What's your problem? Darn it.

23
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,838
-Have a glass of bellflower root whiskey
-Darn it.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,468
-And listen to the deep saxophone
-And listen to the deep saxophone

25
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,265
-I might--
-I might be old enough

26
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,894
To have gotten used to heartbreaks

27
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,524
But a part of me feels empty

28
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:33,820
-This is

29
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:39,242

EPISODE 11

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,592
Can we talk

33
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,511
about the day I was adopted?

34
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,055
Of course. I'm curious too.

35
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,767
I was adopted and disowned twice.

36
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,812
Goodness. Did they not like you?

37
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,564
I was anxious and scared

38
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,691
of everything.

39
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,319
It was around that time

40
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,615
when my sister and my parents
visited the child care center

41
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,700
to do volunteer work.

42
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,286
I'm not sure why,

43
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,414
but they looked so happy.

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,833
Did they?

45
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,543
I was excited to see them

46
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,171
on the morning of their visits.

47
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,883
And I cried

48
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,093
every time they left

49
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,806
because I wanted to go with them.

50
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,311
Then on one cold day,

51
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,523
my sister gave me a pair of warm gloves
and asked me to come home with them.

52
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,108
Let's go to my house.

53
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,027
Let's live together.

54
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,529
That day

55
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,200
was the happiest day…

56
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,829
of my life.

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,626
Ms. Lee Gyeong-suk.

58
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,297
-What did you just call me?
-Ms. Lee Gyeong-suk.

59
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,595
Why did you send your creditor
to my clinic, Ms. Lee?

60
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,057
What?

61
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,601
Do you think it's unfair?

62
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,356
You were never in my life.

63
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,234
You're old enough

64
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,945
to know that life isn't all peachy.

65
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,447
Everyone has a story.

66
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,741
As I grew older, I realized

67
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,869
no matter how tough life may be

68
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,830
and no matter your story,

69
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,707
you should never…

70
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,295
abandon your child.

71
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,885
So?

72
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,471
Don't you dare

73
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,766
contact me or those around me ever again.

74
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,352
My motherly love--

75
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,479
Don't send your creditors to me either.

76
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,525
I was able to study and open the clinic
thanks to my parents.

77
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,616
I didn't know you had that side in you.

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,037
Were you always this coldhearted?

79
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,666
It doesn't feel harsh after I've lived

80
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,337
the life you've given me.

81
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,881
"Motherly love"?

82
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,094
You can keep that to yourself.

83
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,638
If you have any, that is.

84
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,560
My adoptive parents

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,690
are the only parents I have.

86
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,444
People say

87
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,655
a child should always be grateful

88
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,034
to their biological parents
no matter who they may be.

89
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,207
You can't do this to me.

90
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,253
I'm only grateful to the people

91
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,800
who adopted me and raised me as their own.

92
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,637
I won't see you ever again,

93
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,557
so I hope you'll keep these words in mind.

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,441
Take care of yourself.

95
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,644
This will pass.

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,982
Just like the wind.

97
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,882
-Yes?
-Did you meet her?

98
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,721
Yes.

99
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,572
I should've come with you.

100
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,408
It's bothered me all day.

101
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,243
Are you okay?

102
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,915
I guess. I'm all right.

103
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,251
Was it a busy day?

104
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,086
A bit.

105
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,841
I've rarely been going to work these days.

106
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,760
I'm so sorry.

107
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,972
If you hadn't changed your mind,

108
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,226
you would be in the States right now.

109
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,103
But I can still meet you often.

110
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm just grateful.

111
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,112
It's quiet.

112
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,950
It is.

113
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,203
It's nice walking in a park
on a rainy day.

114
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,872
How about some music?

115
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,460
What kind of music do you like?

116
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,004
I don't know much.

117
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,382
What about you?

118
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,551
Besides Rachmaninoff.

119
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,389
Right. I also like "About Romance."

120
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,600
That old song?

121
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,728
Yes. It's my dad's favorite song.

122
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,399
Listening to it with him,
I've grown to like it.

123
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,650
Should we listen to that?

124
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,111
It's okay. Let's listen to your playlist.

125
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,698
Let me see my recent playlist.

126
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,533
How about this one?

127
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,209
It's nice.

128
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,302
It's even better since it's raining.

COLUMBARIUM CONTRACT
JEONG CHAN-YOUNG

132
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,191
Do you want anything? You must be hungry.

133
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,820
It's okay. I just want some water.

134
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,302
Did you see the contract?

135
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,225
I thought it'd be good to
get things ready while I still had time.

136
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,032
How is that good?

137
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,287
That's not what I meant.

138
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,916
You and Dad would be too distraught--

139
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,626
That's why you spent

140
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,628
your precious time doing that?

141
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,130
I didn't want

142
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,842
to burden you guys with that.

143
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,183
Instead of looking
for a way to live longer,

144
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,685
you picked out a columbarium?

145
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,187
Did you have to do that right now?

146
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,981
I'm sorry.

147
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,566
-Just get treatment.
-Mom.

148
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,735
-Get treated.
-Mom!

149
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,080
If I do get treatment,

150
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,500
I won't even have
the energy to argue with you.

151
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,837
I'll be bedridden in the hospital.

152
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,642
Whom did you go with?

153
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,644
There?

154
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,064
With the girls.

155
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,777
I'm home.

156
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,571
-Hey.
-Where are you coming from?

157
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,448
I met up with a friend.

158
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,035
Jeong-pal's son is getting married.

159
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,786
-I see.
-Gosh, that's just great.

160
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,204
They were worried about him.

161
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,831
The girl is pregnant.

162
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,749
Goodness.

163
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,333
Did you have lunch?

164
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,835
Yes, we ate together.

165
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
Is it a shotgun wedding?

166
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,049
-She's five months pregnant.
-Oh, my.

167
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,679
COLUMBARIUM CONTRACT

168
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,264
Read it carefully.

169
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,558
My mom might ask about it.

170
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,811
She must've cried a lot.

171
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,775
I think she cried outside.

172
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,736
Her eyes were bloodshot.

173
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,155
Why did you have to get caught?

174
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,866
Did you want to do this right now?

175
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,993
You're saying the same thing she said.

176
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,620
Of course, I didn't want to.

177
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,624
But I thought I should do it myself.

178
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,668
But why? Why did you think so?

179
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,296
You should only do positive things.

180
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,550
Stop nagging me. It's exhausting to hear.

181
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,231
So did you end it well?

182
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,027
What does she mean?

183
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,032
I visited her.

184
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,080
I told her to never call
me or those around me ever again.

185
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,499
And then? What did she say?

186
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,918
I don't remember.

187
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,921
I just bombarded her
with harsh words and left.

188
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,423
Well done. You did well.

189
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,094
I could get punished.

190
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,096
That's bullshit.

191
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,058
If people got punished for doing that,
everyone would go to hell.

192
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,685
You only stood your ground.

193
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,020
You're objective
about other people's affairs

194
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,982
but too subjective about your own.

195
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,527
Did you really want
to break your mom's heart like this?

196
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,615
I can't imagine how she feels
when we're this upset.

197
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,202
Look. There she goes again.

198
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,164
That's enough.

199
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:41,305
CHA MI-HYEON

200
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,222
Come in.

201
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,184
Shouldn't you have lunch?

202
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,769
I'm on a diet.

203
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,771
That's random.

204
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,441
There's an upcoming competition.

205
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,945
Do you know how hilarious it is
that you'll be attending a dance contest?

206
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,657
Hey. You better come to see the contest.

207
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,036
I'll destroy that bizarre prejudice
you have of me.

208
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,704
Sure.

209
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,297
Mi-hyeon.

210
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,716
I heard you found out.

211
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,223
Of course, I do.
I know everything about you.

212
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,350
You're right.

213
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,810
You always catch me red-handed.

214
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,189
You were always at the internet cafe

215
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,691
whenever I skipped
a tutoring lesson and went there.

216
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,693
It was so strange.

217
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,037
Are things better now?

218
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,666
-Yes.
-How?

219
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,377
I had a fight.

220
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,628
With whom?

221
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,798
That woman.

222
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,094
Who won?

223
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,725
We both lost.

224
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,985
Are you going to see her
from time to time?

225
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,363
No.

226
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,782
Good. Don't see her.

227
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,576
Why not?

228
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,203
Because you're mine.

229
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,671
I just have low energy
since I'm on an empty stomach.

230
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,090
This won't do. I'll eat something.

231
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,174
Don't.

232
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,678
Fight the urge. You have a long way to go.

233
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,887
I lost a kilo.

234
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,268
Just go to the bathroom,
and you'll easily lose that much.

235
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,605
Right.

236
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,816
Mom wants you to bring Seon-u over.
Set a date.

237
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,817
All of a sudden?

238
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,278
Hey, this is better done impromptu.

239
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,198
Hold on. You're not the one
I should be discussing this with.

240
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,575
Where are you going?

241
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,827
-Hey--
-Dr. Kim!

242
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,175
HYOCHANG PHOTO STUDIO

243
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,106
How about you take your coat off?
You look a bit stuffy.

244
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,276
It's okay. I'll keep it on.

245
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,778
Okay.

246
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,862
Let's begin.

247
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,908
You shouldn't smile
since it's an ID photo.

248
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,747
I'll take it now.
That's good. One, two, three.

249
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,504
You must've been surprised
that I suddenly wanted to see you.

250
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,756
Of course, I was.

251
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,177
I invited you over for dinner
but you wanted a cup of coffee with me.

252
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,097
"Is this a classy way of turning it down?"

253
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,766
You made me think all night.

254
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,683
I'm sorry.

255
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,019
I was just joking.

256
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,818
Sir, you can drop the honorifics.

257
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,195
This feels more comfortable.

258
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,739
All right.

259
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:32,536
So what's bothering you so much
that you look this timid?

260
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,497
You see,

261
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:41,294
I've eagerly waited for the day
Mi-jo's parents would invite me over.

262
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,424
But I have a confession
to make before that.

263
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,094
A confession?

264
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,389
This is unexpected.

265
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,314
To tell you the truth,

266
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,819
my father met Mi-jo before.

267
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,929
Do you think
you became a good piano player

268
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,433
because of your adoptive father's money?

269
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,361
You were born with the gift,

270
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,866
and it came from your late parents.

271
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,555
Now I understand
why you called it a confession.

272
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,100
Anyway, you told me that

273
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,062
because you didn't know
if you should accept our invitation.

274
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,897
Am I right?

275
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,233
I'm just ashamed.

276
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,653
What did Mi-jo say?

277
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,738
She said…

278
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,493
What your father said broke my heart.

279
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,498
But that was out of your control.

280
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,668
So I'm okay.

281
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,635
Mi-jo is wise just like me.

282
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,137
She's a wonderful girl.

283
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,764
Don't you agree?

284
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,224
Yes, I do.

285
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,019
She's very wise and wonderful.

286
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,271
She grew up well.

287
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,857
She's praiseworthy.

288
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,865
Look.

289
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,078
I hope that incident
doesn't affect your relationship.

290
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,708
I'm going to tell her this as well.

291
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,877
I hope you two

292
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,964
won't be affected by your father's words.

293
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,509
Of course, I'm offended too.

294
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,596
Mi-jo is my precious daughter
whom I've doted on.

295
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,890
It infuriates me
that she had to hear that.

296
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,018
But what can I do?

297
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,979
That's how your father feels.

298
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,067
And that's something
he'll have to deal with.

299
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,195
I hope you and Mi-jo

300
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,947
will continue on like this.

301
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,743
We will.

302
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,916
Thank you for telling me this.

303
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,294
It must have been
a hard confession to make.

304
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,463
It was hard, right?

305
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,718
You're right.
It was a pretty hard confession.

306
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,560
What do you like? Do you like ribs?

307
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,646
Anything is fine.

308
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,650
No. You need to pick one dish.
How about beef ribs?

309
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,319
I love beef ribs.

310
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,447
That's great. I'll be able
to have some thanks to you.

311
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,660
Mi-jo's mom rarely makes it
because it requires a lot of work.

312
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,995
She always tells me
to eat at a restaurant.

313
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,041
I see. I'm really craving some beef ribs.

314
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,759
It's wonderful to be in a sedan, Dad.

315
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,637
-Doesn't it feel comfortable?
-It does.

316
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,348
It better be comfortable.
The running costs are expensive.

317
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,225
Let's go to a department store.

318
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,561
What for? We don't need anything.

319
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,189
Mom, you need to spend money
for the economy's sake.

320
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,275
There are countless others
who can do that.

321
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,987
What? I think we're almost there.

322
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,117
What do you think? Nice, right?

323
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
Yes, it is.

324
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,163
This is on me.

325
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,790
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

326
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,542
It's nice.

327
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,378
-This looks good.
-Gosh.

328
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,506
-You too, Dad.
-I can get it myself.

329
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,967
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

330
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,219
-Eat up.
-Okay. Eat up.

331
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,522
Your restaurant
also needs a transformation.

332
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,151
The ambiance of a restaurant
matters too nowadays.

333
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,570
People say our restaurant
feels nice and cozy.

334
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,323
You should renovate it, Dad.

335
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,116
It's too run-down.

336
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,202
What for? It's completely fine.

337
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,787
It's not fine at all.

338
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,080
It's cold in winter and hot in summer.

339
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,125
Both the heater and the ACs work fine.

340
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,294
Then just the kitchen.

341
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,173
It's even too small
for you and your worker.

342
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,051
Eat up. The food here
is tastier than mine.

343
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,260
Eat up.

344
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,470
Mom.

345
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,391
We can take our time and do it later.
What's the rush?

346
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,601
Because I…

347
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,570
Here. Have some of this.

348
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,366
This is their signature dish.

349
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,243
-Really?
-Should I try some?

350
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,245
-Try some.
-It looks pretty.

351
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,205
You should eat too.

352
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,708
-Okay.
-The chef here cooks well. This is good.

353
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,172
-It's tasty.
-Is it?

354
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,257
Yes.

355
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,260
Come on in.

356
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,470
Here.

357
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,680
What is this?

358
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,724
Kimchi. The director doesn't
want you to have store-bought kimchi.

359
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,143
-Did you guys make this?
-Yes. We made tons.

360
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,896
Why didn't you call me over?

361
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,108
We should have this with boiled pork.

362
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,818
I'm drooling.

363
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,736
Come by next time. I'll make some.

364
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,531
But cooking isn't your forte.

365
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,657
What did you say?

366
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,328
You should've called me
instead of carrying this all the way here.

367
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,539
I had something to do in Seoul anyway.

368
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,791
Like what?

369
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,253
I had a job interview.

370
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,756
Where?

371
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,509
An orchestra.

372
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,347
The Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra.

373
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,726
If I don't get in,
I'll apply to other orchestras.

374
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,186
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

375
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,231
I hope I'll get in somewhere.

376
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,110
Hey. Of course, you'll get in.
I know how good you are at piano.

377
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,194
I'm sure you will.

378
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:52,911
Mi-jo said I became a good pianist
because I was born with the gift.

379
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,078
What?

380
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,581
She said that it wasn't
thanks to our father's money.

381
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,377
She said she'd never be as good as me

382
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,755
even if she received the same education.

383
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,093
What I love the most

384
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,346
is playing the piano.

385
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,351
Thank you, So-won.

386
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,267
Seon-u, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

387
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,606
Thank you. Thank you, Mi-jo.

388
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,566
Thank you so much.

389
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,569
What is it? What's going on?

390
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,074
So-won had a job interview

391
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,243
at the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra.

392
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,494
-Really?
-Yes.

393
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,622
I'm so happy for her.

394
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,751
I'm so glad she did. I really am.

395
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,461
It's all thanks to you.

396
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,172
You saved her. Thank you so much.

397
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,346
This is just great. I'm so happy for her.

398
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,391
This is wonderful.

399
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,993
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO
DERMATOLOGIST

400
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,415
Did you have lunch?

401
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,168
Yes. I did.

402
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,171
You must've been asleep.

403
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,465
Yes. I dozed off.

404
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,133
Let's go to a botanical garden.

405
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,760
I'm done with work for the day.

406
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,304
Did you know there was one in Seoul?

407
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,555
It looks amazing.

408
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,681
Next time.

409
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,809
I have plans with my parents later today.

410
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,729
Really?

411
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,732
Then let's meet in the evening.
I can come over.

412
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,151
We'll see.

413
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,196
Let's talk again later.

414
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,114
Okay. Rest up.

415
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,836
Chan-young, it's a clear day.
Do you want to go for a walk?

416
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,671
It's cold.

417
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,757
Maybe later.

418
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,094
I'll turn up the heater.
Are you very cold?

419
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,512
No.

420
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,348
It's cold outside.

421
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,141
I see.

422
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,070
CHAN-YOUNG'S MOM

423
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,909
Hello?

424
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,455
No, I'm still at the clinic.

425
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,959
Yes, I'm done for the day.

426
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,925
I see.

427
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,894
Mom, don't worry too much.

428
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,566
Okay.

429
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,279
Okay.

430
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,800
-Yes?
-What are you up to?

431
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,260
Nothing.

432
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,928
Let's go for a drive.

433
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,722
With you on such a cold night?

434
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,099
I'm tired.

435
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,144
I'm already on my way. I'm hanging up.

436
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,828
Why is she waiting out in the cold?

437
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,383
Gosh, it's freezing.

438
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,346
Look at your nose.
It must be frozen. It's red.

439
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,097
When did you come out?

440
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,933
I came out as soon as you hung up.

441
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,353
It's strange. I was excited to see you.

442
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,107
What if you catch a cold?

443
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,487
I can't believe
I'm going for a drive with you.

444
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,959
Turn down the heater.

445
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,378
I'm getting cooked alive in here.

446
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,129
You shouldn't catch a cold.

447
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,424
I might because it's too hot.

448
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,809
Aren't you tired?

449
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,979
Maybe it's the coffee
I had in the afternoon.

450
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,188
I'm not sleepy at all.

451
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,446
You know what?
I shot a photo for my funeral.

452
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,034
But I couldn't tell him
that it was for my funeral.

453
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,954
I just said it was for an ID photo.

454
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,039
But I don't like it.

455
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,043
I wanted to smile,

456
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,628
but he told me not to.

457
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,547
Are you bored?

458
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,136
You're doing
all sorts of things by yourself.

459
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,390
I even shut down my social media.

460
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,142
Why?

461
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,853
I looked into it.

462
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:39,567
Your family will have to go through
a long procedure to do it after you die.

463
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,484
Hey.

464
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,903
Take me home if you're going to nag.

465
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,254
It's hard to be the happiest…

466
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,549
terminally ill person.

467
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:17,563
OPEN 24 HOURS

468
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,192
There are a lot of people
even at this hour.

469
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,695
A lot of people have trouble sleeping.

470
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,659
When you have trouble sleeping,
you should go outside

471
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,661
instead of taking sleeping pills.

472
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,996
And doze off at work?

473
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,798
Once a person dies…

474
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,719
Should I not say this?

475
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,014
Go on.

476
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,309
Say whatever you want.
Today's your cheat day.

477
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,860
Once a person dies…

478
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,988
Once I die,

479
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,159
will I be able to see you guys?

480
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,413
I'm not sure.

481
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,707
Will I become a spirit

482
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,712
and be able to watch my parents, you guys,

483
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,840
and Jin-seok cry?

484
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,552
I wonder if that's possible.

485
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,266
Everyone dies.

486
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,229
But I don't know
what will happen to me once I die,

487
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,897
and I think that's what scares me.

488
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,820
Since no one knows
anything about it, right?

489
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,406
I wonder…

490
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,702
if it'll be very painful
when I take my last breath.

491
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,083
I think about that nowadays.

492
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,174
Why do you have
such dark thoughts these days?

493
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,384
I'm not sure.

494
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,512
My emotions go up and down lately.

495
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,224
I only came out today since it was you.

496
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,311
I bet Jin-seok feels lost right now

497
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,813
because I keep refusing to see him.

498
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,526
I don't know why,
but I don't want to go out these days.

499
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,822
Are things…

500
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,868
getting tougher for you these days?

501
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,912
I think so.

502
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,582
And it gets worse

503
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,792
every time I feel pain.

504
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,795
It must be

505
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,256
very painful.

506
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,011
I can't live without painkillers.

507
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,059
What if they don't work anymore later?

508
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,605
I'm scared.

509
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,608
Chan-young.

510
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,988
I wish I could share it with you.

511
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,493
-Share what?
-Your pain.

512
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:22,164
I wish I could take away your pain
and be sick instead of you

513
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,417
half of the time.

514
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,920
Don't be absurd.

515
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,674
I mean it.

516
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,885
It hurts…

517
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,014
to watch you go through it all

518
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,684
by yourself.

519
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,446
I…

520
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,533
really lived a great life.

521
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,910
Other than my parents…

522
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,875
who would want to share my pain?

523
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,503
I bet Jin-seok would.

524
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,048
Right.

525
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,305
You and Jin-seok…

526
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,893
I'm grateful.

527
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,120
It feels stuffy in here. Let's go.

528
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,714
Are you not cold?

529
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,798
No.

530
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,804
Who do you think of the most these days?

531
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,306
Besides me.

532
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,142
You're not even on the list.

533
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,395
Come on. I know I'm pretty high up there.

534
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,066
My parents.

535
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,445
I wonder if they'll be
able to live without me.

536
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,615
I worry every day.

537
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,994
They should've had another child.

538
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,956
Joo-hee and I will visit them often.

539
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,919
Please do.

540
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,338
I mean that.

541
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,676
Don't worry.

542
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,847
Their restaurant has a cold floor.

543
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,226
It worries me
that they eat and sleep there.

544
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,145
I don't get why they won't go home.

545
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:55,484
It must be more convenient
since they need to open early.

546
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,736
I understand that, but…

547
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,572
The kitchen is run-down.

548
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,866
It's hot in summer and cold in winter.

549
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,288
Why did it take me so long to notice that?

550
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,712
We've matured quite a bit lately.

551
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,798
Don't you agree?

552
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,720
The deposit I got from the studio
and the rest of my money

553
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,639
turned out to be a hefty sum.

554
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,351
You're rich now.

555
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,646
I want to do something
for my parents with that money,

556
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,066
but it's not like they don't have money.

557
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,735
Should I buy some stocks for them?

558
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,114
Come on. You need to learn
how to do stocks.

559
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,659
If you can't think of anything,
just give it to me.

560
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,872
I should give you some for your wedding.

561
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,790
You're going to marry Seon-u anyway.

562
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,461
Come on. What are you talking about?

563
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,881
What? You're not going
to say you had a lot of fun

564
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,924
and break up with him, are you?

565
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,844
You'll become notorious in Cheongdam-dong.

566
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,139
What I mean is,
why are you suddenly talking about me?

567
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,225
And marriage is no joke.

568
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,311
What would I become notorious for?

569
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,898
You're stressing me out again. Jeez.

570
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,735
You're stressing me out
after taking me for a drive.

571
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,986
It's freezing.

572
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,197
We're going to freeze to death.
Let's go back.

573
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,741
Gosh. You're unbelievable, Mi-jo.

574
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,079
-Bye.
-Bye.

575
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,171
Make sure your bed is warm.

576
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,510
Door opening.

577
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,195
I'm sorry I came this late at night.

578
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,571
Is something wrong?

579
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,741
No, I just stopped by to see Joo-hee.

580
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,910
I see. Would you like something?

581
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,537
No, I'm good.

582
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,580
Why do you want to see me?

583
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,960
Mom, go to bed first.
I'll go home after chatting with her.

584
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,713
Okay. Make yourself at home.

585
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,324
What's wrong?

586
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,120
Chan-young took

587
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,290
a portrait for her funeral by herself.

588
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,129
I can't believe her…

589
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,091
She hardly leaves her house these days.

590
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,969
I noticed.

591
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,473
I wanted to go over
to her house several times,

592
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,435
but she kept making up excuses.

593
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,062
She wanted to smile in her photo,

594
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,773
but the photographer said

595
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,402
she shouldn't smile for an ID photo.

596
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,197
She couldn't even smile
when she took the photo.

597
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,744
I can't believe she went by herself.

598
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,122
What should we do?

599
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,553
Are you insane?

600
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:53,930
Do what?

601
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,309
You want to do what with me?
Register our marriage?

602
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,518
Why do you keep asking?

603
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,146
Because it's just ridiculous!

604
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,023
Hey.

605
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,653
-Calm down and--
-As if I can.

606
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,321
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,573
I have a clearer head now.

608
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,410
I became clear-headed
once I made up my mind.

609
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,874
You're driving me crazy. Hey, Jin-seok.

610
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,086
Hey. Do you really think
I'm that bad of a partner?

611
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,634
That's not why.

612
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,345
Just think…

613
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,142
Just think about it.

614
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,355
You're a divorced man.
Do you want to become a widower too?

615
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,816
Of course, that's not what I want to be.

616
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,486
I want to be Jeong Chan-young's husband.
Your husband.

617
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,034
I want to be your husband

618
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,162
even after you leave me.

619
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,252
Don't ever talk about this again.

620
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,921
If you do,

621
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,590
I won't see you ever again.

622
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,886
Do you understand?

623
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,722
I can't answer that.

624
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,100
It's cold. Let's go home.

625
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,643
You can go to your house.

626
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,774
JOO-HEE

627
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,112
Don't follow me.

628
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,200
JOO-HEE

629
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,911
Why is she calling me?

630
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,084
If you don't give us the key,
we'll break into your restaurant.

631
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,254
Why do you guys want to
suddenly fix the restaurant?

632
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,631
It's not like there's a special occasion.

633
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,260
Exactly. It'll be nice
to renovate it while you take a break.

634
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,931
Chan-young wants to buy stocks
with the deposit money from the studio.

635
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,516
This would be better than that.

636
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,684
But…

637
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,480
Why would you waste money
on a perfectly fine restaurant?

638
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,525
Mom.

639
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,280
Chan-young is worried sick.

640
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,993
She wants to do something for you guys.

641
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,079
So let's do that.

642
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,123
Let's make her happy.

643
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,543
Goodness.

644
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:33,632
Imagine how excited
she'd be during the renovation.

645
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:38,970
She's having a tough time
cooped up in her room all day.

646
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,726
Excuse me.

647
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,355
Hey, Joo-hee.

648
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,774
What am I doing?

649
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,027
Right now?

650
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:58,323
Let's hang out with Chan-young.
Meet in front of her house by 2 p.m.

651
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,950
Hey, Joo-hee.

652
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,916
This has autofocus,
so it won't be difficult to use.

653
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,876
I hope I don't break it.

654
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,003
I tend to break everything that I touch.

655
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,922
It's okay.

656
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,633
Don't worry, and just take
many photos of Chan-young.

657
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,677
I'm so sorry for doing this again.

658
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,263
Why don't you just hire a new part-timer?

659
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,681
That's okay.

660
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,016
He helps me out whenever you're busy.

661
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,520
Thank you.

662
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,938
Don't mention it.

663
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,439
It's okay. He's jobless.

664
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,026
I'm a screenwriter.
I'm not jobless, you asshole.

665
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,737
I'm not jobless. I'm quite busy.

666
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,656
I should get going then.

667
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,324
-Thank you, Hyeon-jun.
-Bye.

668
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,868
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

669
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,581
How could you call your friend jobless?

670
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,041
The minimum wage won't cut it.

671
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,126
-Seven thousand won.
-Ten.

672
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,168
-Eight.
-Ten.

673
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,128
Nine thousand won.

674
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,256
Ten thousand won.

675
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,260
-Fine.
-Yes! Deal!

676
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,845
-Awesome.
-Do your money’s worth.

677
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:02,804
Okay, I will.

678
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:07,434
This place is so lovely.

679
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,936
Chan-young, isn't this place wonderful?

680
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,398
Check that out.
Is this Jurassic Park or something?

681
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:16,860
Come over here. Hey, I like this angle.

682
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,696
This is a perfect spot!

683
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,823
Stand by the flowers.

684
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,159
-Here?
-Yes. Stand there.

685
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,161
-Here?
-Yes. Stand by the flowers.

686
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,332
But you should've told me
we were taking photos.

687
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,708
I look like a mess.

688
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,586
Today's theme is being natural.
You look perfect.

689
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,756
Are you sure that camera works?
It's not a toy, is it?

690
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,259
This is Hyeon-jun's precious camera.

691
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,761
It's really heavy.

692
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,348
Who judges a camera by its weight?
You should've checked if it works well.

693
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,683
Whatever. Just stand there

694
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,894
and start talking to each other.

695
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,688
Then I'll take some candid photos, got it?

696
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,607
Go on. Be natural.

697
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:57,943
I feel uneasy.

698
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,738
You told her
that I took a portrait, didn't you?

699
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,908
We just had a heart-to-heart talk.

700
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,578
You know she always gives
her all to everything.

701
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,872
Chan-young. Look here and smile.

702
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,959
Look here. Peekaboo.

703
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,294
Are we babies?

704
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,464
How pretty. Done.

705
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,549
-Done?
-That place looks nice. Let's go.

706
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,218
-Let's move.
-You're done?

707
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,929
Where are you going? Hey!

708
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,058
-Hurry. There's a pond.
-I'm coming.

709
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,560
-Here.
-I'm coming. Where?

710
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,770
-Here. Stand here.
-Here?

711
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,772
-Where? Here?
-Here.

712
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,065
-Watch out.
-It's behind you.

713
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,275
-You look so pretty.
-Watch out. You might fall.

714
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,152
One, two, three.

715
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,154
How pretty.

716
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,990
-Mi-jo, get out of the picture.
-Okay.

717
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,158
-I'll take a solo shot.
-Just me?

718
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,994
One, two, three.

719
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,414
That's so pretty. You looked so natural.

720
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,040
That's good.

721
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,167
One, two, three.

722
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,671
That's it. You look so pretty.
Your legs look really long.

723
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,089
One, two, three.

724
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,134
That's it. You look so gorgeous.

725
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,761
-Stop it. Come here. Take one with me.
-Me?

726
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,304
Okay. Go, Mi-jo.

727
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,224
Pretty poses. One, two, three.

728
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,686
-Join us.
-Come.

729
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,771
-Let's take one together.
-Should we?

730
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,607
-Okay.
-Let's take a selfie.

731
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,526
One, two, three.

732
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:27,115
Hey, you look gorgeous here too.

733
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,867
Last one. One, two, three.

734
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,870
-How pretty.
-When will this end?

735
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,246
-Goodness.
-Gosh!

736
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,914
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

737
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,291
-Jeez.
-Oh, my goodness.

738
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,501
-I'm so sorry.
-Are you okay?

739
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,586
Joo-hee…

740
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,713
Chan-young.

741
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,864
Gosh, I'm exhausted. We've aged.

742
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,825
Our legs are sore.

743
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,994
I hope the photos look good.

744
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,164
He said it had autofocus,
so I'm sure they will.

745
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,208
If they don't look good, I'll…

746
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,252
Regardless, we got some fresh air
and had a blast.

747
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,630
You're right. It was a blast. Right?

748
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,299
Remember how Joo-hee
took photos on her back?

749
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,634
"Hey, smile!"

750
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,761
-Hey, stop that!
-"Hey!"

751
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,888
She looked like
a professional photographer.

752
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,681
Stop making fun of me.

753
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,936
Guys.

754
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,687
-I'm not doing it.
-Don't even ask.

755
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,272
Damn it, it's not like that.

756
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,068
I'm going to learn nail art.

757
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,695
-Nail art?
-Yes.

758
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,614
I'm thinking about opening a nail salon.

759
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,493
That suits you.
You're the meticulous type.

760
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,330
Right. You used to work in makeup
before moving to skincare.

761
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,623
You're good with colors.

762
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,459
Exactly. You know I was better
than anyone at makeup there.

763
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,128
-No.
-I don't.

764
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,921
Okay. Anyway…

765
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:08,424
Once I learn how to do it,
your nails will be mine.

766
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,094
That sounds frightening.
Is this a horror movie?

767
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,887
"Your nails are mine."

768
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,806
I should practice.

769
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,765
Not on me.

770
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,809
I shouldn't get cuts.

771
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,186
They'll lead to infections
and complications. Okay?

772
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:21,980
You're right.

773
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,734
-Not on me either.
-Why not?

774
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,695
I'm scared.

775
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,822
What? That's a valid reason.

776
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:36,286
Damn it! You're so self-centered.

777
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,913
-What? Why is that being self-centered?
-Hey!

778
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,542
Don't you remember
how I sacrificed my veins for you

779
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,920
when you were inexperienced in med school?

780
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,215
-Right.
-Darn it.

781
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,302
How could you be
such a self-centered brat?

782
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,433
What? Isn't that…

783
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,226
What is that?

784
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,853
Don't get on my bad side

785
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,272
because Jeong's Kitchen is in my hands.

786
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,065
Why do you have that?

787
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,693
I persuaded her parents
to hand it over to me.

788
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,487
They agreed to renovate the kitchen.

789
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,367
How could they listen to you
and not their daughter?

790
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,203
How do I put it? The gift of gab?

791
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,247
The skill of persuasion?
Something like that.

792
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,709
Good thinking. We should help out then.

793
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,795
Right. We'll have to move everything,
and we'll also…

794
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,174
-We need more help.
-How about Seon-u?

795
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,093
Don't call Jin-seok.

796
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,096
You guys fought again?

797
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,598
He keeps talking nonsense.

798
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,311
He wants to get married.

799
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,313
Unbelievable.

800
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,401
I'm all for it.

801
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,820
Shut up.

802
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,364
He's finally matured.

803
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,158
Can you guys please shut up?

804
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,582
Seeing you here feels different.

805
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,752
Goodness, why are you guys standing up?

806
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,711
Welcome.

807
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,964
-Welcome.
-Hello. My name is Kim Seon-u.

808
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:11,923
Here you go, sir.

809
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,466
You didn't have to.

810
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,676
This is for you, ma'am.

811
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,095
I've been waiting for this day.

812
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,931
Thank you for inviting me over.

813
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,893
I smell braised short ribs, Mom.

814
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:27,230
Seon-u told me
that it was his favorite dish.

815
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,023
We have similar taste in food.

816
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,608
Yes. You're right.

817
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,461
By the way, are you an only child?

818
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,130
He has a beautiful younger sister.

819
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,756
She majored in piano at Juilliard.

820
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,634
Then is she in the States?

821
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,887
No, ma'am. She's in Korea.

822
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,639
She's trying to join an orchestra.

823
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,518
Please invite us
to one of her performances.

824
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,894
Yes. That'd be great.

825
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,439
That'd be wonderful. I'll tell her.

826
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,276
Come to think of it,
she'll be your sister-in-law.

827
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:17,196
Well, that's not good.
You'll end up badmouthing each other.

828
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,575
It's a relief you're the only one
getting ahead of herself.

829
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,076
What's wrong with you, lady?

830
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,495
See? This is how she treats me, Mom.

831
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,664
"Lady"? How could you call me that?

832
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,666
She's right. She's your older sister.

833
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,585
Why talk about sisters-in-law?

834
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,129
So that's not in the picture here?

835
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,797
You should know better.

836
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,425
I agree with you.

837
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,178
So-won is already practicing
for our wedding song.

838
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,346
Unbelievable.

839
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,058
We're seeing eye to eye.

840
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,310
Honey, let's drink some wine.

841
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,936
It's still broad daylight.

842
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,357
Mom, happy occasions like this one
always call for afternoon drinks.

843
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:56,778
I think I'll be a good sister-in-law,
but not you. You're too much for her.

844
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,322
Dad, let's grab a drink later.

845
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,491
Seon-u?

846
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,534
Let's listen to your mom

847
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,244
and just have water.

848
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,038
Water goes best with ribs.

849
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,002
I want to go on a blind date.

850
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,462
I like this vibe.

851
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,093
I feel ecstatic today.

852
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,720
My two daughters
have finally come to their senses.

853
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,682
Honey, this is wonderful. Can I sing?

854
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,016
-No.
-No.

855
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,643
Seon-u will be shocked.

856
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,479
Not at all. Sir, let's hear it.

857
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:35,024
-Really?
-He must be really happy today.

858
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,734
It's that song again, isn't it?

859
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,487
Yes. Do you know "About Romance"?

860
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:42,699
Yes, I do.

861
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,868
Just say you don't.
He'll keep bothering you.

862
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,995
When can I begin?

863
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,248
Right now!

864
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,168
Perfect. All right. Here I go.

865
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,128
Okay.

866
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:56,963
I can, right?

867
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,970
On a rainy day

868
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:09,517
Sit in an old coffee shop

869
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,020
Have a glass of bellflower root whiskey

870
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:17,734
And listen to the deep saxophone

871
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,529
Bright, red lipstick

872
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,700
Okay. All right.

873
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:49,182
You look great. I knew it.
You are a terrific subject.

874
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,769
No, you're a terrific photographer.

875
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:02,904
There's…

876
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,158
nothing I can do for you, Mi-jo.

877
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,183
This job is no joke.

878
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,643
How did that lady--

879
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,436
It's "Ms. Jang," not "lady."

880
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,397
Hey, how could a writer
misuse appellations?

881
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,609
Why are you so irritated today?

882
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,405
By the way, where did she go?

883
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,115
She's at a construction site.

884
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,242
A construction site?

885
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,160
She works there?

886
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:14,016
If you keep being mad at me,
I might not let you out of the car.

887
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,853
I might leave everything
up to Mi-jo and Joo-hee

888
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:20,147
and just go for a drive instead.

889
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,358
Whatever.

890
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:33,953
Sir, could we enlarge
the kitchen by a meter?

891
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,581
-Yes, it's possible.
-Really?

892
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,082
It'll become quite spacious.

893
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,334
That's good.

894
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,671
Also, could you turn that storage room

895
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,215
into a resting area for two people?

896
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,800
Sure. That won't be a problem.

897
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:52,513
I see. Could you also install a heater
underneath to make it as warm as possible?

898
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:02,106
Guys, I think they bought this
when I just got into elementary school.

899
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,150
You're right. It's an artifact.

900
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,903
We should donate it to a museum…

901
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,869
Hey, these are too old.

902
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,746
Let's get rid of them.

903
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,915
My mom would never. We need to do it.

904
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,459
My mom can't get rid of things either.
No mom can.

905
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,002
-I'll put them outside.
-Okay.

906
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:26,464
Right. Microplastics are harmful. Right?

907
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,801
-Oh, my gosh!
-What is it?

908
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,095
What's wrong? Check on her.

909
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,348
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

910
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,266
-Hyeon-jun.
-What?

911
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,813
I'm not seeing things, am I?

912
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,150
No, you're not. It's me, Park Hyeon-jun.

913
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,401
How did you get here?

914
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,444
I drove.

915
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,365
I came because I was too hurt
to make jjajangmyeon.

916
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,452
I'm glad you're here.
I'm so happy that I could cry.

917
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:59,246
How did you know this place?
Did I give you the address?

918
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,041
This is the only
Jeong's Kitchen in Yangpyeong.

919
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,710
But why are you so upset?

920
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,338
Is there no loyalty among us?

921
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,095
You're right.

922
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,807
Every time something came up,
I let you meet at my restaurant.

923
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,643
Shouldn't you consider me a crew member?

924
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,687
But why didn't you call me over?

925
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,064
I agree. Why didn't you?

926
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,941
You should have, Joo-hee.

927
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:31,988
Well, I didn't because I felt bad
that you'd have to close the restaurant.

928
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,866
Come on,
closing for just a day won't hurt.

929
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,160
Why leave a chef
out of a kitchen renovation?

930
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,204
This is your bad.

931
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:43,916
Joo-hee, don't do this.
You're really hurting my feelings.

932
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,380
Chan-young.

933
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,507
I made some porridge.

934
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,175
Aren't I good? Aren't I sweet?

935
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,385
Her mother made some--

936
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,095
Give that to me.

937
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,848
If it wasn't for you,
I would've starved all day.

938
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:01,100
Hey, let's order in something too.
I'm famished.

939
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,144
-What should we have?
-I want jjajangmyeon.

940
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,979
-What?
-I want jjamppong.

941
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:09,358
Come on.
You know I make those all the time.

942
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,901
Their tangsuyuk is amazing.

943
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,029
-Get a set.
-What do you want?

944
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,155
-Two sets.
-I want…

945
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,746
JEONG'S KITCHEN

946
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,017
Let me do it.

947
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,852
-Thank you.
-Just sit down.

948
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,771
Aren't you glad I came?

949
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,399
What? Are you not happy?

950
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,943
Should I just go home?

951
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,404
Just help out since you're here anyway.

952
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,117
It's snowing.

953
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,704
It's snowing!

954
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:05,915
It's so pretty.

955
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,171
It's so pretty.

956
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,591
-Is this the first snow?
-So pretty.

957
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,717
-It's so white.
-Right.

958
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,053
It's nice.

959
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,098
-It was good, right? I told you so.
-Yes.

960
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,851
Does that karaoke machine even work?

961
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:27,895
Probably.

962
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,898
Joo-hee, sing a song for us.
A seductive one.

963
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,025
Come on. What's wrong with you?

964
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,445
Hey, why would you make
the worst singer sing and ruin the vibe?

965
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,364
Go on. I'm curious.

966
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,699
No. I'm not going to sing.

967
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,451
No, thanks. I won't do it.

968
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,665
Three, three.

969
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,669
It works.

970
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:52,878
Applause!

971
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,342
It's been ages.

972
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:16,152
You're getting the feeling
You're getting butterflies

973
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:21,699
Until when will you steal glances at me?

974
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:27,621
Tell me how you feel
Don't play dumb

975
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:31,417
Just follow your heart

976
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,587
And hold my hand

977
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,810
-Okay. Mi-jo, next.
-Next.

978
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,270
-You go.
-What?

979
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,688
You can sing the full song.

980
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,773
You should sing. You have a favorite song.

981
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,775
"About Romance", right?

982
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,069
You might as well just live together now.

983
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,280
You know practically everything about her.

984
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,448
No, thanks.

985
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,950
My voice cracks when I sing it sober.

986
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,161
It's okay. I sang just fine.

987
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,121
Unbelievable.

988
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:13,334
Go on.

989
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,169
-Hurry. Sing for us.
-Come on.

990
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:16,337
-Jeez.
-Hurry up.

991
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,049
"ABOUT ROMANCE"
CHOI BAEK-HO

992
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,184
On a rainy day

993
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:36,232
Sit in an old coffee shop

994
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:41,070
Have a glass of bellflower root whiskey

995
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:45,574
And listen to the deep saxophone

996
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:51,538
-I might be old enough
-She's good.

997
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:56,168
To have gotten used to heartbreaks

998
01:10:56,252 --> 01:11:00,756
But a part of me feels empty

999
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:06,053
This is

1000
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:10,307
About my long-lost romance

1001
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,562
You've improved.

1002
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,701
Go to a port late at night

1003
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:35,124
Go to a ferry wharf

1004
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:39,795
Though there won't be anyone returning

1005
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:44,258
Listen to the sad foghorn sound

1006
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:54,935
Where could she be growing old like I am?

1007
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:03,152
Listen to the sad foghorn sound

1008
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:09,700
People think I won't yearn

1009
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:14,413
TO BE YOUNG AGAIN

1010
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,168
But a part of me feels empty

1011
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,878
This is…

1012
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,702
This is about the things we have lost.

1013
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,791
This is about you

1014
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,251
who we'll be losing.

1015
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:18,287
This is about the things
that won't come back.

1016
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,794
This is about our moments.

1017
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:17,471
What would my funeral be like?

1018
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,557
Chan-young's weird today.
What should I do?

1019
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:22,267
She's not leaving us yet.

1020
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,729
People I want at my funeral.

1021
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,481
What is this?

1022
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:30,943
Can you visit my parents
on their birthdays every year?

1023
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,152
What should I get them?

1024
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,196
Have my parents get medical checkups.

1025
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,697
VISIT CHAN-YOUNG'S PARENTS
FOR THEIR BIRTHDAYS

1026
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:37,658
No, not later.

1027
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,326
Let's do it now.

1028
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:40,827
I just want to say…

1029
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,329
Thanks to you guys,

1030
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,249
my life couldn't have been better.

1031
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:52,381
