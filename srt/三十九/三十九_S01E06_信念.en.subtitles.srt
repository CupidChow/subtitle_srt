1
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,884
Mi-jo.

2
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,428
This isn't necessary.

3
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,557
We both know you didn't cheat.

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,641
I did cheat.

5
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,856
The cheat sheet belonged to Ji-hyeon.

6
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,317
The cheat sheet dropped right next to me,

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,818
and I saw it.

8
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,364
Of course, you saw it.
It fell right before your eyes.

9
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,949
How could you not?

10
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,911
You even have good eyesight,
so it's natural that you saw it.

11
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,704
I was having trouble with that question.

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,415
Korean History, question number 23.

13
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,627
I was upset
because I didn't know the answer.

14
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,045
Then I saw it.

15
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,672
So I wrote it down as my answer,

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,801
but I can't let it go.
I want the points deducted.

17
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,016
That question is worth six points.
You know that, right?

18
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,267
Yes.

19
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,687
Okay. You may go.

20
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,783
You would've become a historical figure
if you were born a long time ago.

21
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,243
Hey.

22
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,453
Did anyone catch you looking at it?

23
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,371
No.

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,081
Then why?

25
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,999
Why did you come clean?

26
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,043
You're obsessed with grades. So why?

27
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,045
-We should always be honest.
-What a joke.

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,588
You're unbelievable, Mi-jo.

29
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,258
She just had two bowls of noodles
out of frustration.

30
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,512
Should I eat one more?

31
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,931
-That's enough, you brat.
-You'll get an upset stomach.

32
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,057
-Let me have some.
-No.

33
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,102
CHA MI-JO

34
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:30,024
CONVICTION

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,530
-Hey. I'm sorry I took so long.
-She's here.

36
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,115
You must be hungry.

37
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,075
It's okay. I didn't wait that long.

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,368
What should we have?

39
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,788
I used up all my energy, so I'm famished.

40
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,290
Where did you go?

41
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,168
You see, I have an eccentric friend.

42
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,921
I feel drained
whenever I hang out with her.

43
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,507
Compared to her, I'm pretty much normal.

44
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,344
You're still bitter about that?

45
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,263
Yes.

46
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,184
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

47
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,526
Why is she here with you, Seon-u?

48
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,529
What brings you here?

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,323
Why are you here?

50
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,093
Long time no see, So-won.

51
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,139
Hello.

52
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,266
You look well.

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,269
We have plans.
I'll call you later, Father.

54
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,355
And you are?

55
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,274
Hello, sir.

56
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,194
I work here with Dr. Kim.

57
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,862
Are you the director?

58
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,405
Yes.

59
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,825
Are you here for something urgent?

60
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,371
I came because I wanted
to have dinner with my son.

61
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,789
I have plans.

62
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,041
With her?

63
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,213
I was hoping to eat dinner with my son.

64
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,383
If it's okay with you, may I join?

65
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,555
Well, I don't mind…

66
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,393
Then I'll come back next time.

67
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,394
You should join us.

68
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,691
It's nice to see you, So-won.
It's been a long time.

69
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,956
Can I ask what your father does?

70
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,878
He used to teach at a university.

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,132
He's retired now,
and he's become a nuisance to my mom.

72
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,636
He eats all three meals at home
and it drives her nuts.

73
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,056
Which university? I might know him.

74
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,892
Let's just eat, Father.

75
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,896
I apologize.
I was just excited to meet you.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,065
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,942
-Here.
-Thank you.

78
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,155
So-won, do you want anything else?

79
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,906
No. I'm okay.

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,783
Try some of this too. Here.

81
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,870
So-won, you haven't changed.

82
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,873
How so?

83
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,418
What do you mean exactly?

84
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,754
Like right now.

85
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,756
You make everyone uncomfortable

86
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,341
because you can't read the room.

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,929
Maybe it's because I used to be an orphan.

88
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,974
What did you just say?

89
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,143
Whenever I walked on eggshells,

90
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,812
you always told me

91
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,356
to stop acting like an orphan.

92
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,985
You were concerned.

93
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,405
This is very uncomfortable.

94
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,326
I apologize, Dr. Cha.

95
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,329
I'm sorry. I should go.

96
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,331
Orphans…

97
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,667
can't help but act that way, sir.

98
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,587
No matter how comfortable they are…

99
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,131
No matter how much
their adoptive parents love them…

100
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,675
They could go to a nice high school,

101
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,011
go to med school,
and open their own clinic,

102
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,682
but the fact that they're an orphan
will always make them feel depressed

103
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,726
and small.

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,104
Yes, it seems that way.

105
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,273
I guess it can't be helped.

106
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,360
I think that's why they tried
to embrace me even more.

107
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,112
I mean, my adoptive parents.

108
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,407
I grew up at an orphanage,

109
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,910
so I know how it feels.

110
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,207
So I wanted to explain to you
that it's not just So-won.

111
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,293
I apologize if it made you uncomfortable.

112
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,301
I have a lot of respect
for your adoptive parents.

113
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,428
They raised you very well.

114
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,559
I guess we failed to provide
a good environment for So-won.

115
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,228
I'm sorry, So-won.

116
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,899
I was able to come this far thanks to you.

117
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,777
I'm very grateful

118
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,905
to both Seon-u and Mom.

119
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,242
I wish you good health.

120
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,621
I'll go.

121
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,416
I'm sorry. I'll see you next time.

122
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,674
Call me when you leave for Boston.
I'll go to the airport.

123
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,052
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

124
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,889
I should see a shaman while I'm in Korea.

125
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,184
Why is it that you're surrounded by--

126
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,268
Dad.

127
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,855
I'll see you again.

128
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,868
You won't find any cabs
if you go that way.

129
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,549
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,013
I really can't help myself.

131
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,766
I easily lose it
when someone starts talking about orphans.

132
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,311
I ruined the mood, didn't I? Sorry.

133
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,063
You didn't.

134
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,399
I shouldn't have come.

135
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,485
I ruined the mood.

136
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:51,239
Don't be ridiculous.
Seon-u's father was the one who joined.

137
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,782
Don't blame yourself.

138
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,247
We came to eat dinner,
but I'm not full at all.

139
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,706
Let's go eat.

140
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,917
I don't think I can.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,378
Have some soju and you'll be just fine.

142
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,296
Trust me. I'm a doctor.

143
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,883
Can I drink beer instead?

144
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,886
Of course. They're a family.

145
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,140
Just a second.

146
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,061
Oh, it's Seon-u.

147
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,064
We're going for round two.

148
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,860
Can you handle alcohol better now?

149
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,320
A bit.

150
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,158
Goodness, he's such a gentleman.

151
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,494
What kind of gentleman peels fruit?
I bet he's never even…

152
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
I can make soup for you again.

153
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,959
-He's a boring lightweight drinker.
-I enjoy drinking.

154
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,419
I'll be your drinking buddy.

155
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,923
This must be expensive.

156
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,218
It seems like we met just yesterday.

157
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,679
Soup made while giving
relationship advice? No thanks.

158
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,639
My gosh.

159
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,018
Ask your mom about the ladies
who worked at Siloam Snack Bar.

160
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,811
One of them could be Mi-jo's mom.

161
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,646
I was so shocked when I saw you.

162
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,982
I guess Chan-young is serious.

163
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,692
Is Chan-young coming?

164
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,694
No.

165
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,618
I told her she should visit.

166
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,995
Why hasn't she come by yet?

167
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,538
She's busy.

168
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,206
Is she getting treatment?

169
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,083
No.

170
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,086
She's just busy.

171
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,255
Did she tell her parents?

172
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,590
Not yet.

173
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,261
I bet it's hard for her to tell them.

174
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,728
Mom, back when
you used to run a snack bar,

175
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,522
did any of the ladies who worked there

176
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,858
mention anything about an orphanage?

177
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,612
I'm not sure. Why?

178
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:59,742
Chan-young really wants
to find Mi-jo's biological mom for her.

179
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,703
I thought she was joking,
but she's actually pretty serious.

180
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,498
She should focus
on taking care of herself.

181
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,833
Why does she suddenly want
to find Mi-jo's mother?

182
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,752
Mi-jo's doing fine.

183
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,753
Right?

184
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,841
But I guess Chan-young feels differently.

185
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,930
Mi-jo became friends with us
while trying to find her birth mother.

186
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,517
But why do you think she wrote

187
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,436
"Siloam Snack Bar, Gocheok-dong"
on Mi-jo's adoption papers?

188
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,857
These dried anchovies
remind me of gochujang.

189
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,235
Mom, do you also want a beer?

190
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,404
No, I'm good.

191
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,996
I have to say,

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,667
this is more than just a coincidence.

193
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,461
It's easy to find graduates
from the same school,

194
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,922
but it's really rare to meet someone

195
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,134
who's from the same orphanage.

196
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,469
Cheers to that.

197
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,012
-Cheers.
-Bottoms up.

198
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,014
Me too.

199
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:05,933
No, not you.

200
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,102
I was kidding. Don't drink too much.

201
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,485
The orphanage hasn't changed at all.

202
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,737
The director's a bit older now,

203
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,990
but everything else is the same.

204
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,034
Did you keep visiting
even after you got adopted?

205
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,329
Not when I was young.

206
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,126
My friends were still there.

207
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,713
I just felt bad.

208
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,425
My parents and sister
visited from time to time.

209
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,721
I think it was when I was in high school.

210
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,141
That's when I started visiting with them.

211
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,767
And I've been going ever since.

212
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,019
The kids are adorable.

213
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,856
The three of us

214
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,233
should go there one day. What do you say?

215
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,736
Sure.

216
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,950
Not everyone wants to go.
It depends on the person. Right?

217
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,834
By any chance…

218
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,962
If you ever feel like going,

219
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,590
you can call me. I'll go with you.

220
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,553
Cheers.

221
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,261
YEONGWOL PRISON, GANGWON PROVINCE
INMATE NUMBER 2382, LEE GYEONG-SUK

222
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
If you raised her,

223
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,274
she wouldn't have grown up so well.

224
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,031
Take So-won home.

225
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,700
I have somewhere to go.

226
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,201
Now?

227
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,787
There's someone I miss.

228
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,914
Seon-u, you should be on your toes.

229
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,208
She misses someone after drinking.

230
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,668
It must be someone special.

231
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,504
I admit that this person is
extremely charming,

232
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,381
but there's nothing dangerous about it.

233
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,801
There's a cab coming.

234
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,511
I'll see you guys.

235
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,971
Let's meet often, So-won.

236
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,306
-Bye.
-Bye.

237
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,725
Let me.

238
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,477
-Bye.
-See you.

239
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,853
Hey.

240
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,481
What are you doing here?

241
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,442
I was waiting for you.

242
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,445
You reek of alcohol.

243
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,697
Damn it.

244
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,283
I drank an adequate amount.

245
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,202
How much is that? Ten bottles of soju?

246
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,870
You dummy.

247
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,916
I can't drink ten bottles of soju.

248
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,586
Did you drink with Seon-u?

249
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,339
Yes.

250
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,258
I drank with Seon-u

251
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,803
and his sister.

252
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,392
Why do you ask?

253
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,311
Are you jealous?

254
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,315
I'm in no situation to be jealous.

255
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,112
It's nice that you're making friends.

256
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,990
You're going to be bored without me.

257
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,679
You're hopeless.

258
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,101
Why?

259
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,688
I guess you're going to cry
about every little thing.

260
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,211
You're such a crybaby.

261
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,675
I should quit drinking.

262
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,888
Why would you give up such a good thing?

263
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,557
All that alcohol…

264
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,938
just turned into tears. It's annoying.

265
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,817
CHAN-YOUNG

266
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,027
SEON-JU

267
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,844
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

268
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,033
Ju-won.

269
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,035
Yes?

270
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,328
Does your dad pick up

271
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,205
if you call?

272
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,874
I haven't tried calling him.

273
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,710
Should I?

274
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,254
No.

275
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,759
Should I make you something?

276
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,970
No.

277
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,111
Do your legs hurt?

278
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,779
Yes, they do.

279
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,032
My back hurts too.

280
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,367
I'm old now.

281
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,619
Should I massage them?

282
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,078
No, it's okay.

283
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,457
It tickles when someone else
massages my calves for me.

284
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,084
-But I'm not just anybody.
-You know what I mean.

285
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,424
What did you want to talk about?
Is it about Chan-young?

286
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,137
I don't feel comfortable
about leaving Chan-young all alone.

287
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,765
She needs to eat properly.

288
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,309
It's hard to take care of yourself
if you live alone.

289
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,354
Is she really not
going to tell her parents?

290
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,149
We went to see them.

291
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,984
Really? Did you guys tell them?

292
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,863
But she didn't mention it.

293
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,866
And it wasn't my place to say anything.

294
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,161
I think she needs some time.

295
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,539
I hope she's not skipping meals.

296
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,714
We decided she would be the happiest
terminally ill person in the world.

297
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,510
But I'm not sure what to do.

298
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,221
I can't sleep these days.

299
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,933
I tell myself to hold it in,

300
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,977
but I cry every day.

301
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,355
Me too.

302
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,069
Let's take turns and visit her.

303
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,613
Chan-young will throw a fit.

304
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,240
Then we'll throw one too.

305
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,600
The budaejjigae place nearby
gives you a ton of ham.

306
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,102
-It's good.
-I'll be right back.

307
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,520
-Okay. See you.
-Bye.

308
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,439
Bye. Did you eat?

309
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,441
-I ate way too much.
-I see.

310
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,567
I might doze off later.

311
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,653
Didn't you eat with Dr. Cha?

312
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,572
She had a lunch appointment.

313
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,906
I see.

314
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,116
Aren't you going to eat?

315
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,244
I missed my timing.
I'm going to get something simple.

316
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,538
Take your time. But be quick.

317
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,831
Oh… Okay.

318
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,751
Have you guys had lunch?

319
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,210
-Yes.
-Yes. Have you?

320
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,946
So-won, is that you?

321
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,006
Seon-u told me you were doing well,

322
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,508
but I was still curious.

323
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,344
I'm glad you came.

324
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,931
Everything's pretty much the same.

325
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,184
Well, you know this place.
It never changes.

326
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,520
We renovated the place though.

327
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,522
You haven't changed at all.

328
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,732
Nonsense. I've aged.

329
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,654
What brings you here all of a sudden?
I was so surprised to see you.

330
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,908
I just thought I'd visit.

331
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,119
I'm glad you did.

332
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,373
You look exactly the same.

333
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,960
You used to laugh so much
when you were little.

334
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,212
I loved hearing you laugh.

335
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,590
You'd follow me around
and giggle like this.

336
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,259
I did?

337
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,396
How does it feel to be here?

338
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,358
It's nice.

339
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,778
It's really nice.

DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO
DERMATOLOGIST

343
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,302
-Hey, Seon-u.
-Where are you?

344
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,054
I'm still at the clinic.

345
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,225
Hello? Seon-u?

346
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,145
Is this your dinner?

347
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,022
I wasn't that hungry.

348
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,399
My sister got it for me.

349
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,694
Gosh, you should eat a proper meal.

350
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,113
I took a bite out of that one.

351
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,990
This one's new. Eat this one.

352
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,701
No, it's okay. It's delicious.

353
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,622
It's good.

354
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,712
Were you nearby and on an empty stomach?

355
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,757
I went to a nearby bookstore.
The lights were on at the clinic,

356
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,092
so I called.

357
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,013
I actually…

358
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,810
bought a few things
so I could try them with you.

359
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,606
Apparently, time flies when you do this.

360
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,150
You can even fold peonies. Look.

361
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,361
THE WORLD'S MOST FUN ORIGAMI

362
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,623
Or…

363
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,753
You know famous quotes, right?

364
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,714
Quotes that give you strength.

365
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,092
You can write these quotes

366
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,052
to clear your head.

367
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,096
Sounds nice, right?

368
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,897
Gosh, Korean alphabets are beautiful.

369
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,358
Yes, they are.

370
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,653
But it looks hard.

371
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,198
Or…

372
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,327
There's more?

373
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,537
This will do the trick. Here.

374
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,089
What do you think?
Don't you want to try it?

375
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,716
Looks fun, right?

376
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,347
So I just need to choose?

377
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,267
Do you have more, by any chance?

378
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,478
Really?

379
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,856
Seriously?

380
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,319
It's like a treasure chest.

381
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,489
What is that?

382
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,118
I bought it
just in case you might like it.

383
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,456
Do you solve those when you're bored?

384
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,749
Well, I…

385
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,626
No.

386
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,851
Coloring books.

387
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,270
It's been so long.

388
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,107
I don't even remember how long it's been.

389
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,778
The colored pencils are really pretty too.

390
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,823
Gosh, we didn't have this
back in our days.

391
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,794
Thank you.

392
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,758
Seon-u.

393
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,094
You're like a rest stop.

394
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,431
A rest stop on the highway.

395
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,062
Pretty, right?

396
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,815
You're prettier.

397
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,031
Hey.

398
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,034
Goodness.

399
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,830
The restaurant is nice and petite.

400
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,540
Don't you have work at the hotel?

401
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,875
You didn't hear? It's getting renovated.

402
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,127
That's time off for you.

403
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,926
Think about it.

404
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,720
The head manager wants you to come.

405
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,016
Thanks for the offer.

406
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,394
But the place is finally doing okay.

407
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,021
Just ask someone to run the place for you.

408
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,606
I bet people will line up.

409
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,316
Should I find someone?

410
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,029
Is it because of Chef Jeong?

411
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,369
I want to try this too.

412
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,121
Me too.

413
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,957
-Me too.
-Goodness. Okay.

414
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,167
They've been using testers for 30 minutes.

415
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,003
-Unbelievable.
-Be quiet.

416
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,422
Excuse me.

417
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,968
Yes, how can I help you?

418
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,927
I'd like a new one.

419
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,307
Ma'am, this is a tester.
You can try it out with this.

420
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,518
Let us open up a new one.
My daughter wants to try it.

421
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:40,815
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't help you with that.

422
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,359
Let's go somewhere else, Mom.
The service is horrible.

423
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,404
Then can you just pay
for a new one so we can try it out?

424
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,531
Do what's good for business.

425
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,616
Me?

426
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,621
It's not even your business.
I expected too much.

427
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,164
Let's go. Have a good one.

428
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,749
You too. Bye.

429
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,278
I prefer lean meat.

430
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,368
-Is this a protein-based dish?
-Yes.

431
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,622
I see. Then next time,
is it going to be suyuk?

432
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,706
Yes.

433
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,501
Are you kidding me?

434
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,836
You know I don't like boiled meat.

435
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,213
Me neither.

436
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,715
Then next time,
just grill it instead of boiling it.

437
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,342
No. It's bad for your pancreas.

438
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,635
You say everything is bad!

439
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,095
-Hey!
-What?

440
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,682
I don't like chicken soup either.

441
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,850
I never once bought suyuk
with my own money.

442
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,019
What's your point?

443
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,107
But I'm eating it because I'm your friend.

444
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,404
I thought you wanted me
to enjoy my remaining life.

445
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,948
Did you really have to shout like that?

446
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,950
I'm a patient, you know.

447
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,663
I was a little loud, wasn't I?
Let's eat elegantly.

448
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,254
What's that?

449
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,423
What?

450
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,175
My clothes.

451
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,721
Don't tell me you're moving in.

452
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,805
No.

453
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,181
I'm not.

454
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,641
Then what's with the clothes?

455
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,519
Joo-hee and I are
going to take turns to visit you.

456
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,146
I can't bring clothes every time.

457
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,315
Do you guys not care at all
about what I want?

458
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,692
Of course we care.

459
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,652
That's why we're not moving in.

460
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,530
Taking turns to visit every day
is practically living here.

461
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,615
I never said we'd come every day.

462
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,451
We're busy too, you know.

463
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,205
Here.

464
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,000
What is it?

465
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,504
Whenever I can't make it,
look at that. It's a drawing of me.

466
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,630
Don't tell me

467
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,885
Seon-u, the artist,
drew this portrait of you.

468
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,180
He did. It's a perfect drawing of me.
It looks like me, right?

469
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,185
-Yes, totally.
-Right?

470
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,605
-He really did a great job of drawing me.
-I see it.

471
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,148
I see the resemblance.

472
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,283
Chef Jeong got fired.

473
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,744
So we took the chance to renovate.

474
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,454
Come back, Hyeon-jun.

475
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,248
You'll be the head chef.

476
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,385
Since you're still here…

477
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,599
I was walking by,
and I noticed that the lights were on.

478
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,395
I was actually craving a drink.

479
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,106
I'm glad you came.

480
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,316
That's a relief.

481
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,819
Oh, should I cook something?

482
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,198
No, it's okay. You worked all day.
I bought beef jerky and some other stuff.

483
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,450
Sounds good.

484
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,332
You bought a lot of stuff.

485
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,755
I love this beef jerky.

486
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,223
Some customers can be
really obnoxious like that.

487
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,684
I met a lot of them as a hotel chef.

488
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,228
I don't even want to think about it.

489
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,689
I'm starting to get sick of it.

490
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:55,236
Up until my mid-30s,
I just easily brushed it off.

491
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,404
But now,

492
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,948
it just hurts.

493
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,951
Gosh.

494
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,662
That has nothing to do with age.

495
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,914
It hurts even if you're young.

496
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,794
That really comforts me.

497
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,217
When I quit working at the hotel,

498
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,179
everyone told me I was crazy.

499
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,514
"You're almost there."

500
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,642
"Pretty soon, you'll be the head chef."

501
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,561
"Can't you hang in there?"

502
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,439
Well, I really couldn't. I wasn't happy.

503
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,111
You're awesome.

504
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,002
What?

505
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,381
Why are you laughing? It was a compliment.

506
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,968
No one's ever said that to me before.

507
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,805
No one has ever complimented me
for quitting my job at the hotel.

508
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,227
Is your girlfriend still upset about it?

509
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,938
I guess.

510
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,858
She probably just thinks of this place

511
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,903
as a tiny neighborhood restaurant.

512
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,364
You must feel upset.

513
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,367
I can understand her.

514
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,203
I'm sure she'd rather tell people

515
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,372
that I'm a chef at a five-star hotel

516
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,291
than tell them
that I run a Chinese restaurant.

517
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,590
I'm so old now.

518
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,636
But I'm getting sick of working
as a manager at a department store.

519
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,138
What am I going to do with my life?

520
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,724
I'm so worried.

521
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,313
Listen.

522
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:59,026
Apparently, your real age
is 0.8 times your actual age.

523
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,070
How old are you? Let's see.

524
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,240
You're in your early 30s.

525
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,950
You're still young.

526
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,332
I'll bring more beer.

527
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,169
Okay.

528
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,759
That means you're in your 20s.

529
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,469
Sorry?

530
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,432
Nothing. Let's call it a night
after one more bottle.

531
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,613
I thought you guys were taking turns.

532
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,201
We haven't decided on the order yet.

533
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,080
I guess there's been a miscommunication.

534
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,085
She reeks of alcohol.

535
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,215
Chan-young, can I get a pair of sweatpants

536
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,260
and a cotton T-shirt that's nice and soft?

537
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,305
Nothing fits you.

538
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,351
Then can I wear Jin-seok's?

539
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,191
He's never slept here before!

540
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,662
I'm wearing a skirt.
Can I borrow your pajamas?

541
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,044
Don't you have anything else?

542
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,592
You guys are so tiny.

543
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,345
What made you guys stop growing?

544
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,721
I was busy becoming pretty.

545
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,722
Me too.

546
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,018
Are you implying that I'm tall and ugly?

547
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,978
That's how you took it?

548
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,438
That's correct.

549
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,026
My mom says that I'm pretty enough.

550
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,072
What's sad is that the person
who told you that was your own mother.

551
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,032
My gosh.

552
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,120
-Gosh, you're so annoying.
-Hey.

553
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,705
Hey! Move your head!

554
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,915
It's so heavy.

555
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,292
That's because my brain is
loaded with knowledge.

556
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,877
Or because you have a big head.

557
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,298
No. That's not true. I don't.

558
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,425
You're wrong.

559
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,634
Gosh, so loud.

560
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,677
You little…

561
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,012
Stop it.

562
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,119
I need to sleep.

563
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,749
Those women?

564
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,004
One minute.

565
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,466
I'm off to make money.

566
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,511
Okay. Make a lot of money, Joo-hee.

567
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:39,139
She's right. Earn a lot of money
so you can buy snacks for Hyeon-jun.

568
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,475
See you.

569
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,601
Bye.

570
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,201
You should go too.

571
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,705
Why would I?
I have nothing to do on the weekend.

572
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,460
Spend time with Seon-u.

573
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:13,549
I told you.
We had fun with that coloring book.

574
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,928
You're really mean.

575
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,142
Why? Why am I mean?

576
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,059
Hey.

577
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,978
Seon-u got you all those things.

578
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,148
He did all that
so you wouldn't feel depressed.

579
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,108
But you've done nothing for him.

580
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,985
Yes, I have.

581
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,612
What? What have you done?

582
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,866
I ate with him and his little sister.

583
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,618
Okay. What else?

584
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,333
I ate with them and…

585
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,296
My gosh, you're really unbelievable.

586
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,757
You make him work hard on weekdays

587
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,550
but don't meet him on weekends?

588
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,845
You totally hold all the power.

589
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,765
I should call him and ask

590
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,309
if he wants to have dinner.

591
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,895
Yes, you should. You mean brat.

592
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,938
Who's calling?

593
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,901
-What?
-Speak of the devil.

594
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,110
-Is it Seon-u?
-Yes.

595
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,738
My gosh. I can't believe this.

596
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,241
Hello?

597
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,495
Hey. What are you up to today?

598
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,956
I have nothing special planned.

599
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,708
Should we have dinner together?

600
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,920
Sure. We can do that.
Or how about we go camping?

601
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,630
-Camping?
-Yes.

602
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,800
A friend made reservations,
but his daughter is sick.

603
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,385
So I figured we could go instead.

604
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,513
You want to go today?

605
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,515
We can go and have a barbecue.

606
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,600
There's not much to prepare.

607
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,018
Just go already.

608
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,816
Okay. Let's go get some fresh air.

609
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,946
Okay.

610
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:01,990
Good job.

611
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,992
Good job.

612
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:04,993
Do you want to join us?

613
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,133
This is her address.

614
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,897
Throw away the photos.

615
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,066
Bye.

616
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,160
JEONG'S KITCHEN

617
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,621
-Honey.
-Yes?

618
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,124
I'm thinking about visiting Seoul.

619
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,002
-To see Chan-young?
-Yes.

620
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,420
Why all of a sudden?

621
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,381
I just miss her.

622
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,091
Plus, I haven't visited in a while.

623
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,469
Goodness.
Is that why you made side dishes?

624
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,553
Yes.

625
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,932
I'll meet her
and come back before midnight.

626
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,727
Okay. Go ahead.

627
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,853
Okay.

628
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,981
Did we buy Napa cabbage?

629
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,442
No, never mind.

630
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,944
I bought it last Tuesday.

631
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:25,407
We need the receipt
to help you with the refund.

632
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,494
Listen. It's not like
a ton of people bought this product.

633
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,872
Just check the list of sold products
from last Tuesday.

634
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,000
If you're a member,
we can check with your phone number.

635
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,543
Can you tell me your number?

636
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,920
I'm not a member.

637
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,507
And why do I need to give you
my personal information?

638
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,092
I'm sorry.

639
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,387
We have a lot of customers
who ask for this product.

640
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,473
Can you look for the receipt again?

641
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,351
I can help you get a refund
as soon as you find it.

642
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,438
You really treat your customers horribly.

643
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,736
Go ahead and look for it yourself.

644
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,323
This is so annoying.

645
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:10,285
You're so nice when I buy things.
Why is it so hard to get a refund?

646
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,126
I'm busy, so hurry up!

647
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,254
I'm sorry. Just a second.

648
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,594
Here it is.

649
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,513
You bought this on sale.

650
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,974
If you give me your card,
I'll help you get a refund.

651
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,601
-But the sale is over now.
-Pardon?

652
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,396
This product will be sold
at its normal price.

653
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,565
Then I want a refund at that price.

654
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:41,858
Ma'am.

655
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,405
The refund only covers
the money that you spent.

656
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,827
What's wrong with your customer service?

657
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,331
What is this? A market stall?
Why are you making this so hard for me?

658
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,375
Give me your card,

659
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,669
and I'll help you get back
the money you spent.

660
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,887
-Let me get it for you.
-Don't pick it up.

661
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,639
-Ms. Jang, I'll--
-Don't pick it up.

662
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,183
You must've lost your mind.

663
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,560
Pick up your card…

664
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,062
and give it to me.

665
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,232
I want to talk to the CEO
of this department store!

666
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,277
-What do you think you're doing?
-What do you think you're doing?

667
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,238
You threw your receipts on the floor.

668
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,657
Then you threw your card at me.

669
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,992
You can't do that.

670
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,285
Do you want to get fired?

671
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,620
Watch how you speak to me.

672
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,250
I just quit,

673
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,462
which means I no longer work here.

674
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,549
This is between us now.

675
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,843
Apologize…

676
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:54,306
pick up your card, and politely
ask the employee for a refund.

677
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,974
Only for the money you spent.

678
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,477
You're a complete psycho.

679
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,437
Are all your staff like this?

680
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,398
It's people like you that drive us crazy.

681
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:07,527
Why can't you have some common sense?

682
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,445
You…

683
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,616
You obnoxious brat!

684
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,909
Hey!

685
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,827
What did you call me? Obnoxious?

686
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,372
-Hey! Repeat what you just said!
-Ma'am.

687
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,915
-How old are you?
-Please stop.

688
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,958
-How old are you?
-What's with you?

689
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,210
-My gosh!
-Please.

690
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,796
Where are you going?

691
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,172
Where are you going?

692
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,507
MANAGER JANG JOO-HEE

693
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,440
Goodness.

694
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,818
Where am I going to go?

695
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,330
Isn't it nice to be out?

696
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,583
Yes, it's nice.

697
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,752
See?

698
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,672
You should try new things
and visit new places.

699
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,966
Be honest.

700
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,010
Isn't it nice to have a boyfriend?

701
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,889
Your question is too straightforward.

702
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,892
Gosh, you always
try so hard not to admit it.

703
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,565
-Joo-hee?
-What?

704
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,444
Hey, Joo-hee. What's up?

705
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,780
I'm going somewhere.

706
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,703
Are you serious? Did something happen?

707
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,205
Why? What happened?

708
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,875
Where are you right now?

709
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,169
Really?

710
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,673
No, I'm going somewhere right now.

711
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,677
Go home. Don't go wandering off.

712
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,512
I'll call you later.

713
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,598
Okay.

714
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,682
Bye.

715
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,102
What's wrong?

716
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,437
Joo-hee…

717
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,231
What's with her all of a sudden?

718
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,692
She just quit her job.

719
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,402
Really?

720
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:18,366
She's not the type to do this.
She's usually very careful about stuff.

721
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,244
She worked there for over ten years.

722
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,246
I wonder what happened.

723
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,675
Should we go back to Seoul?

724
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,558
No. We already bought all the equipment.

725
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,685
We can go next time.

726
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,813
We even bought meat.

727
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,439
It'll go bad.

728
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,526
Let's just go. I'll meet her tomorrow.

729
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,581
Hey.

730
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,043
Why didn't you pick up?

731
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,461
It's at home.

732
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,590
What's that?

733
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,134
Sweatpants for Joo-hee.

734
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,636
Why does she need sweatpants?

735
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,058
What's that?

736
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,439
I can't stay a day longer at the hotel.

737
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,775
The temperature isn't right,

738
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,320
and the humidity is so low.
My throat hurts.

739
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,365
Then go home.

740
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,952
Why are you unpacking here?

741
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,329
Do you have instant noodles?

742
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,914
I'm sick of eating hotel food.

743
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,708
I ate outside too many times.

744
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,128
Will you please stop?

745
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,842
You're making things harder for me.

746
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,637
I can't go.

747
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,807
Even if you leave,

748
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,935
I can't go with you.

749
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,567
Why would you come with me?

750
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,864
You should live your life.

751
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,369
Do me a favor.

752
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,747
Please.

753
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,332
Just…

754
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,127
Just let me stay with you.
Pretend I'm not here.

755
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,338
I'll just do the things you ask,

756
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,673
and I'll help you out
only when you need it.

757
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,217
Then I'll go back
to pretending I'm invisible.

758
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:47,974
Just let me stay by your side.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

759
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,745
We…

760
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,123
never should've met.

761
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,434
The weather is nice.

762
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,188
It's the perfect weather
to go camping, right?

763
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,112
This is driving me nuts.

764
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,536
Let's go back to Seoul.

765
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,580
I can meet her tomorrow.

766
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,126
My gosh, why don't you look in the mirror?
You're worried sick.

767
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,504
No, I'm not. I'm really excited right now.

768
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,466
You sound like a robot.
Completely emotionless.

769
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,344
What about all the food we bought?

770
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,722
I'll eat it.

771
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,226
Then I'll quickly check up on Joo-hee.

772
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,602
Let's eat together at home.

773
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,146
We can pitch a tent at home.

774
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,313
That sounds nice.

775
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,898
Come over as soon as you're done.

776
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,609
I'll set up the tent
and have everything ready. Okay?

777
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,445
-Even camping lights?
-Great idea.

778
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,617
Thank you.

779
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,499
My heart just skipped a beat.

780
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,500
What?

781
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,336
It's the first time you've done that.

782
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,215
Don't keep count.

783
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,717
Let's go.

784
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:48,762
Is that it?

785
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,680
Let's go already.

786
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,106
Hey, Joo-hee. Let's meet at Chan-young's.

787
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,400
Yes, meet me there. Okay.

788
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:03,943
Bye.

789
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:20,835
I'll do it.

790
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,920
Don't talk to me.

791
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,009
Who is that?

792
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,637
I'm not expecting anyone.

793
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:35,892
Oh, gosh.

794
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,144
-What am I going to do?
-Who is it?

795
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,270
My mom.

796
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,067
-Chan-young.
-Mom.

797
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,527
You're home.

798
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,320
I was going to drop off some side--

799
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,450
Who…

800
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,454
Hello, ma'am. I'm…

801
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:57,997
Gosh.

802
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,793
-That looks heavy. Let me.
-What? Well…

803
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:02,919
Chan-young.

804
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,047
Right. He's…

805
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,550
It's nice to meet you.

806
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,344
I'm Kim Jin-seok.

807
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:12,929
I see.

808
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:15,849
Hello.

809
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,892
Hello.

810
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,571
Are you Chan-young's…

811
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,324
boyfriend?

812
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,328
I'm trying to get her to like me back.

813
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,295
Did you drive?

814
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,838
-Yes.
-I see.

815
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,631
Mom, sit down.

816
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,009
-Yes. Please have a seat.
-Okay.

817
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,137
What's this?

818
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,640
Are you eating dinner already?
Or is it a late lunch?

819
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,352
I ate lunch but he hasn't eaten yet.

820
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,105
Gosh, you're giving him instant noodles?

821
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,192
Sit down. Let me fix you a meal.

822
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,944
-No, it's okay. I like this.
-Gosh.

823
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,405
Thank goodness I brought some side dishes.

824
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,907
Sit down. It won't take long.

825
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,825
-Oh, okay.
-Sit. You too, Chan-young.

826
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,203
My goodness. I hope you like this.

827
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,498
Goodness gracious.
I'm glad I ran into you.

828
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,877
I feel so bad.

829
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,630
Go and comfort Joo-hee.

830
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,048
Have everything ready.

831
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,591
Call me before you come.

832
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,718
See you later.

833
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,595
Bye.

834
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,392
Mi-jo.

835
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,895
Joo-hee!

836
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,234
Stop it.

837
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,487
I'm so proud of you.
Good job. I can't believe you quit.

838
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,572
Stop touching my butt.

839
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,324
What did Chan-young say?

840
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:59,202
Didn't you call her? I just came.

841
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,995
What? What if she's not home?

842
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,581
Oh, no.

843
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,832
We should've called.

844
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,758
Don't tell her about Jin-seok
or that I'm sick.

845
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,968
I'll kill you.

846
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,346
-It's nice to see you all.
-Yes, it is.

847
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,105
Check your phone.

848
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,357
I think you got a text.

849
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:37,574
I'm so glad I came today.

850
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,701
I'm actually starving.

851
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,370
I'll go buy pork belly.

852
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,539
-No, it's okay.
-We have enough food.

853
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,456
It's enough.

854
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,541
Do you think so?

855
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,504
Mi-jo, I think you got a text.

856
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,927
What? Where's my phone?

857
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,805
Probably in Seon-u's car.

858
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,059
Gosh, I must've dropped it in his car.

859
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,937
Hey, Seon-u.

860
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,439
It's me.

861
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:13,693
I'm sorry, but can you check
if Mi-jo's phone is in your car?

862
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,819
Let me talk to him.

863
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:15,903
Hello?

864
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,656
Where did you drop Mi-jo off?

865
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,283
You should come back.

866
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,161
-Come and eat. My mom's food is amazing.
-Hey!

867
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,704
You're nearby, right? Come over.

868
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,372
Before Mi-jo devours everything.

869
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,583
Is someone coming?

870
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,084
Yes, Mi-jo's boyfriend.

871
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,669
What about Joo-hee?

872
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,589
I'm not going to invite him.
It's a small place.

873
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:37,050
So you guys are all seeing someone.

874
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,552
My gosh, I was worried for nothing.

875
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,560
Should we eat?

876
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,770
-Yes, let's.
-Okay.

877
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,730
Goodness, sit down.

878
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,523
It won't take long. Stay seated.

879
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,650
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

880
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,859
-Of course.
-Okay.

881
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,946
I wonder what Seon-u likes about you.

882
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,324
You should be in front of a tent
having a barbecue.

883
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,492
Why are you here?

884
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,951
You were going camping?

885
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,746
Just worry about yourself.

886
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,581
I should've prepared some bulgogi.

887
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,583
What do you like?

888
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,089
-Jin-seok.
-Yes?

889
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,340
Is it uncomfortable?

890
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:22,470
-Make yourself at home.
-I'm extremely comfortable right now.

891
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,682
She asked you what you like, Jin-seok.

892
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,183
I like Chan-young.

893
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,440
My gosh, he's unbelievable.

894
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,713
Here. Careful.

895
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,175
-It looks delicious.
-Do you enjoy your food bland?

896
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,886
I'm fine with anything.

897
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,847
You don't need to use honorifics, ma'am.

898
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,764
Goodness, no.

899
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,267
You're so mean.
You didn't even ask us what we liked.

900
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,227
My gosh, know your place.

901
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,687
She's right.

902
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:17,275
I thought Mi-jo was the smartest one,
but I'm starting to think otherwise.

903
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,821
That must be him.

904
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,199
My gosh, she's head over heels for him.

905
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,828
Ma'am, you're an amazing cook.

906
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,457
But unlike you, Chan-young can't even
season instant noodles properly.

907
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,792
-What?
-Are you pretending to be a bad cook?

908
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,294
No, it's not that.

909
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:38,963
Move.

910
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,507
What do you think you're doing?

911
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,677
What are you doing?

912
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,554
Get out of my way!

913
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:48,723
Don't do this.

914
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,313
I had to protect them.

915
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:56,397
Please.

916
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,775
Take your hands off me, Ms. Cha!

917
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,527
Please.

918
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,030
Please leave.

919
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,199
I'm begging you.

920
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,868
It may be nothing but
a midsummer night's dream.

921
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:09,786
Please go.

922
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,162
But I had to protect

923
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,498
-Just this once. Please.
-the special moment

924
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,999
that Chan-young was spending…

925
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,125
Please leave.

926
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,585
…with Jin-seok and her mom.

927
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,172
You people are monsters.

928
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,257
He's my husband, and you're…

929
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,636
What do you think you're doing?

930
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,513
No, please…

931
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,891
You can slap me if you want.

932
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,477
You can pull my hair out too.

933
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:36,938
But just this once…

934
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,483
Please turn a blind eye just this once.

935
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,155
It'll all come tumbling down.

936
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,741
But just this once,

937
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,246
I wanted to give
Chan-young's mother a chance to cook

938
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:55,456
for her daughter's boyfriend.

939
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,961
I wanted to give Chan-young a chance

940
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,381
-to introduce her boyfriend to her mom.
-I'm begging you.

941
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,550
Please leave.

942
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,344
I'll do anything you ask.

943
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,180
But just this once…

944
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,142
Please turn a blind eye just this once.

945
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,856
Please. Just this one time.

946
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,193
What's so great about Jeong Chan-young?

947
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,071
Both you and Jin-seok…

948
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,866
Why do you care so much about her?

949
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,172
You're unbelievable.

950
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,876
Conviction.

951
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,755
Even if it meant putting aside
my conviction to always be honest,

952
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,883
I had to protect them.

953
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,593
I used to find laundromats really boring.

954
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,638
I can't believe
I find it entertaining now.

955
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,724
I have a favor to ask of you.

956
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,726
I wish you would
be considerate of yourself too.

957
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,021
Please have some fun with Mi-jo.

958
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,274
SEON-U LOVES MI-JO
IS SEON-U THAT IRRESISTIBLE?

959
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,525
I work here part-time.

960
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,029
How did you think to do
such a praiseworthy act?

961
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,238
What are you talking about?

962
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,239
Why don't you have any?

963
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,490
Why don't you have anything
you want to do?

964
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,243
I'm going to audition for this role too.

965
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,998
Life is so capricious.

966
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:29,336
