1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,134
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,357
Hey.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,780
I forgot this.

4
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,449
Nice. I needed money
to go to a karaoke room.

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,994
I need you to come with me.

6
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,120
Again?

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,747
I'm sorry, but I need her.

8
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,832
-But I have plans.
-Follow me.

9
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,292
Hey.

10
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,171
Sorry, guys.

11
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,183
This is on the house.

12
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,477
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,646
You guys look even prettier in uniforms.

14
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,482
I guess you go to different schools.

15
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,566
-Yes.
-I see.

16
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,735
What brought you here today?

17
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,654
We just came to eat tteokbokki.

18
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,989
No snack bar in your neighborhood?

19
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,367
Anything more?

20
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,244
-I'm full.
-Dumplings, please.

21
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,954
Dumplings?

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,455
Mom.

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,250
Hey, sweetheart.

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,752
I told you, we're the same age.

25
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,304
We're going to a karaoke room.

26
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,556
So?

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,932
Why don't you join us?

28
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,768
No, I'm a horrible singer.

29
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,103
So am I.

30
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,814
What does that matter?
It's about having fun.

31
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,316
But I have to go to an academy.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,901
I skipped a private lesson too.

33
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,070
It was a brave move for someone like her.

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,739
Why should I go with you guys?

35
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,661
I mean, it's just weird.

36
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,288
Don't you like us?

37
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,709
Hey, don't be too straightforward.
You'll scare her off.

38
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,960
I like you.

39
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,755
My gosh, this is so cringey.

40
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,466
Just come with us already.

41
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,802
We won't get a discount if we're late.

42
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,387
Come on.

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,347
Are you going to go to your academy?

44
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,224
Well…

45
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,823
I know a place.

46
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,994
Let's go there.

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,382
Where do you guys live?

48
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,550
Samseong-dong.

49
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,635
Hyochang-dong.

50
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,803
You came all the way
to Gocheok-dong to sing?

51
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,263
We came for tteokbokki.

52
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,975
Hey, does that place give you
a lot of additional time?

53
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,769
Yes, I'm close with the owner.

54
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,896
You must go there really often.

55
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,359
SAMSEONG-DONG, HYOCHANG-DONG,
AND GOCHEOK-DONG

56
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,528
EMERGENCY

57
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,950
Chan-young!

58
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,785
Chan-young.

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,541
Time was not on our side.

60
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,545
It passed quickly

61
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,465
and took us

62
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,676
to the middle of winter.

63
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,097
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

64
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,518
A cold winter that reminded us every day

65
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,731
that we couldn't
keep Chan-young by our side.

66
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,075
Mom, you should sit down.

67
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,130
We finally reached a moment
where we could no longer act

68
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,674
like everything was okay.

69
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,641
EPISODE 12

70
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,574
Hey.

71
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,513
You should start getting ready.

72
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
Is it that bad?

73
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,775
This is going to happen pretty often now.

74
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,903
She should get hospitalized.

75
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,532
I'll discuss it with her.

76
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,828
Can we go get some air?
It's suffocating in here.

77
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,706
Mi-jo.

78
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,126
I want to go home.

79
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,339
You've only been here for two days.
Just stay for a bit longer.

80
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,300
Is it because it's boring here?
We'll come every day.

81
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,678
No. I want to hang out
where it's comfortable.

82
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,056
I really feel uncomfortable here.

83
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,975
Then let's look for a place
with a nice facility.

84
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,977
You mean hospice care?

85
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,438
Gosh, that's even worse.

86
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,067
Just let me go home.

87
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,319
I want to go home and be with my parents.

88
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,279
But what if…

89
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,697
If it starts hurting again,

90
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,867
I'll come back.

91
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,998
I'll look into it

92
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,418
and see if you could get treated at home.

93
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,342
FUNERAL HALL

94
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,261
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm okay.

95
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,686
Let's go. It's cold.

96
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,728
-Okay.
-Okay.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,070
NAME: JEONG CHAN-YOUNG

98
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,270
Hey. What is it? Do you need something?

99
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,482
No. I'm going to take a walk in the lobby.

100
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,942
Okay. I'll go with you.

101
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,279
No, it's okay. I'll just be out front.

102
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,989
I won't be long.

103
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,744
MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE

104
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,422
SPECIAL ROOM 2

105
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,410
Excuse me. Can I help you?

106
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,245
Oh, I'm…

107
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,915
I must've come to the wrong place.

108
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,090
Jin-seok is being such a pain.

109
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,968
He's still going on about getting married.

110
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,681
He's been calling me day and night

111
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,268
to ask me to talk you into it.

112
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,436
Just don't pick up.

113
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,525
Are you refusing
because you're worried about him?

114
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,361
Or…

115
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,405
does it make you uncomfortable?

116
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,622
It'll taint my love.

117
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,341
You're right.

118
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,719
You stayed with him
even when he was married.

119
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,888
A marriage certificate is nothing.

120
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,144
I wish Jin-seok could get my point
just like you always do.

121
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,787
What is this?

122
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,124
People I want at my funeral.

123
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,759
A few days ago,

124
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,804
I went to the funeral hall.

125
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,807
Why?

126
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,392
I just found myself there.

127
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,314
Time passes by slowly
when you're lying on a hospital bed.

128
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,899
It makes you think of things.

129
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,197
It must be suffocating.

130
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
A bit.

131
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,997
I started to wonder.

132
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,794
"What would my funeral be like?"

133
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,426
I don't want everyone in my phonebook

134
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,846
to hear about my death.

135
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,189
You see, these days,

136
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,735
I think about you a lot.

137
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,073
"I wonder how she feels."

138
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,703
So many thoughts

139
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,415
go through my mind.

140
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,170
But I guess I'm not even close.

141
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,714
What do you mean?

142
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,509
I can't even imagine…

143
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,014
how it must've felt…

144
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,560
to put together this list

145
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,063
all by yourself.

146
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,572
I think about you a lot too.

147
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,700
The most, actually.

148
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,747
Mom, Dad, Jin-seok, and Joo-hee.

149
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,791
I think about them all.

150
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,713
But with you,

151
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,925
I feel both reassured and concerned.

152
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,970
I'm giving you that list
because I know I can rely on you,

153
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,264
but at the same time,

154
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,558
I also worry.

155
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,896
What do you worry about?

156
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,024
I worry if you'll be okay

157
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,318
without me.

158
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,002
Chan-young.

159
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,589
You see,

160
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,299
I…

161
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,468
I didn't…

162
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,350
I didn't know you were this dear to me.

163
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,693
"Dear" as in "Dear Ms. Jeong Chan-young"?

164
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,117
I'm starting to feel a bit distant.

165
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,130
What I'm saying is we're so close,

166
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,843
and you're precious to me.

167
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,602
That's a nice word.

168
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,521
"Dear."

169
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,863
PATIENT: JEONG ***-YOUNG

170
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,492
Why is this so funny?

171
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,797
Hey. Don't even think about sticking
hair up her nose. It'll get noisy.

172
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,635
Joo-hee.

173
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,596
Joo-hee.

174
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,680
Yes?

175
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,516
Hyeon-jun is here.

176
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,644
Have you eaten?

177
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,896
-What's with her?
-What was that?

178
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,483
Why would you ask him if he ate?

179
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,234
Go back to sleep.

180
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,905
When will you grow up? This isn't funny.

181
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,865
If you're mature, it means you're old.

182
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,369
Joo-hee, I won't be your friend anymore
if you ever mature.

183
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,746
-Same here.
-Stop talking nonsense.

184
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,123
Oh, my gosh.

185
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,708
You scared us!

186
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,835
-Don't you know how to knock?
-Exactly.

187
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,170
Seriously!

188
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,214
As if you could hear it.

189
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,800
Jin-seok, have you eaten?

190
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,178
I can't believe she asked him that too.

191
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,471
-Exactly.
-What's so funny?

192
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,597
Move.

193
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,391
Joo-hee, are you hungry?

194
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,558
Where are you going?

195
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,185
You should lie down.

196
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,688
-Why are you suddenly up?
-She asked if you ate.

197
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,690
-Did you?
-Obviously. It's almost nine.

198
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,650
-Jin-seok.
-Of course, I ate. Move over.

199
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,657
I'm finally home.

200
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,665
I turned on the heater earlier.
It's warm, right?

201
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,876
Gosh, it's like a dry sauna in here.

202
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,087
Honey, let's open the window.

203
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,716
-Is it too hot?
-Do you want warm water?

204
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,801
No.

205
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,636
Iced Americano.

206
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,056
Unbelievable.

207
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,767
Do you want to go back to the hospital?

208
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,938
If that's the case, then I won't have it.

209
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,776
I'm suddenly starting to crave one too.

210
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,987
No way. Don't be a traitor.

211
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,739
Fine.

212
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,199
Are you home?

213
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,493
You're finally free. I'll be right there.

214
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,246
Okay, I'll call Joo-hee. Bye.

215
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,499
Is there some good news, Director?

216
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,334
Chan-young got sent home. I'm leaving.

217
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,711
Really? Let me go too.

218
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,713
You should stay and treat patients.

219
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,964
Let me go with you.

220
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,299
See you tomorrow.

221
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,388
Go back inside, ma'am.
It's cold. I'll be off now.

222
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,306
Hey.

223
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,643
Chan-young's dad and I are thinking
of going back to Yangpyeong.

224
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,270
Because of your restaurant?

225
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,355
No, it's not that.

226
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,273
Well…

227
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,110
I was hoping

228
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,655
that you could stay with Chan-young.

229
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,496
Thank you.

230
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,498
I should be thanking you.

231
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,875
We'll visit once every week.

232
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,419
It just seems Chan-young…

233
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,674
might feel more comfortable
with you alone.

234
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,053
I'm so sorry.

235
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,391
Chan-young refuses to get married.

236
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,768
What does that matter?

237
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,480
You don't need to be sorry.

238
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,191
You're both so much in love.

239
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,202
Stay still.

240
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,412
I'm not moving.
You're the one who's shaking.

241
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,497
No.

242
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,126
Hey, just… Will you just relax?

243
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,503
Relax your fingers so I can do my job.

244
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,338
You were only going to do one!

245
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,341
You're getting this for free.
Don't give me an attitude!

246
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,135
Did you really get a license?

247
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,471
You saw it for yourself.
What's your problem?

248
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,433
Guys, be careful.
I'm worried you might cut her skin.

249
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,394
This is driving me crazy.

250
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,147
Miss, you were already
crazy to begin with.

251
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,651
Do you see her hand trembling?

252
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,113
My gosh, it's because
you're not relaxing your hand.

253
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,782
-Gosh, look at them.
-Stop it.

254
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,659
How do you perform surgeries?

255
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,120
-I don't, you dummy.
-Some days were clear and sunny,

256
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,874
while some days were very overcast.

257
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,268
Chan-young is weird.

258
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,982
She's weird today. What should I do?

259
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,025
No.

260
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,237
She's not leaving us yet.

261
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,574
I'm sure of it.

262
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,000
Days like these took turns

263
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,920
coming and going.

264
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,175
Electric heaters are nice and warm too.

265
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,721
It's cozier than it is at home.

266
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,100
Maybe it's because
our daughter made it for us.

267
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,364
It gives me strength.

268
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,133
So what is this list based on?

269
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,429
It's a list of people
I'd gladly say yes to

270
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,768
if they called
and asked me to eat with them.

271
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,539
Here. If you choose the left one,
I'll take the right one.

272
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,249
Or it can be the other way around.

273
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,751
You can pick first.

274
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,504
I need to know
what this list is about first.

275
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,425
Is it the list of people
who owe you money?

276
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,343
Chan-young gave it to me.

277
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,263
It's the people she wants at her funeral.

278
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,599
My gosh.

279
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,520
Why are we doing this already?

280
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,355
Let's just do it later

281
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,441
when the time comes.

282
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,986
No, not later.

283
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,031
Let's do it now.

284
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,574
What?

285
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,413
-You think that's funny?
-Yes.

286
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,000
Jin-seok, I'm a bit chilly.

287
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,376
Okay.

288
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,507
Here.

289
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,352
Jin-seok.

290
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,647
Are you upset
because I refuse to get married?

291
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,774
Yes.

292
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,779
Gosh, that was fast.
You're making me feel bad.

293
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,741
I'll be honest with you. I'm really upset.

294
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,790
But we're living together now,
so I'll let you off the hook.

295
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,460
Thank you.

296
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,678
Should we go see my mom tomorrow?
I want to go to Yangpyeong.

297
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,057
Sure.

298
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,393
Let's go after lunch.

299
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,108
You want to go
to a restaurant after eating?

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,739
I've been craving brunch lately.

301
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,453
Sure. You must be sick of Korean food.

302
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,789
No, that's not what I meant.

303
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,542
Porridge is Korean food too.

304
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,130
Fine. Let's try Western porridge.

305
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,548
They have soup, right?

306
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,925
-"Western porridge"?
-Yes.

307
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,344
That's funny.

308
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,060
Hey, did we pick pastel colors?

309
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,312
Yes, there were two.

310
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,565
The one with lots of roses.

311
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,734
Yes, that's the one.
The one that's pink with roses.

312
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,153
Yes, that's right.

313
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,780
See you tomorrow.
Don't be late. Good night.

314
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,240
Okay, good night.

315
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,449
Okay, bye.

316
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,034
JOO-HEE

317
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,161
Have some rosemary tea.

318
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,829
Okay, thank you.

319
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,591
You must be tired. Come here.

320
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,096
Gosh, your shoulders are stiff.
Doesn't this hurt?

321
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,557
It does. It's nice though.

322
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,226
Put some more strength into it.

323
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,269
-More strength?
-Yes.

324
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,857
Oh, gosh.

325
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,235
That wasn't what I meant.

326
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,571
You practically pinched me.
You did it on purpose.

327
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,073
No, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

328
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,330
Do you need my help?

329
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,081
No, don't touch them.

330
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,918
This is done.

331
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,670
This is done too.

332
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,216
-No, it's not.
-Is it not?

333
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,094
I guess a lot of people
have outdoor weddings here.

334
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,222
-Should we just--
-Again?

335
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,598
"Again"?

336
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,266
-Me?
-Who were you married to?

337
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,435
-No, I meant…
-Who are you?

338
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,029
They have a lot of good menus here.

339
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,906
Order everything you want.

340
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,532
Okay. What are you having?

341
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,245
I'll have clam chowder soup.

342
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,412
Will that do?

343
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,706
Of course. Western porridge will do.

344
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,668
-What will you have?
-Me?

345
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,463
Gosh, this is nice.

346
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,264
-Hey, Gi-yeong!
-Goodness.

347
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,016
Hey.

348
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,729
-Fancy meeting you here.
-I know.

349
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm getting goosebumps.

350
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,733
It's been ages.

351
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,735
I know, right?

352
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,987
I missed you, Chan-young.

353
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,198
But don't you live in Daebang-dong?

354
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,701
What are you doing here?

355
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:20,912
What?

356
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,748
So you guys met up here?

357
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,833
It's nice to meet you.

358
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,213
-I can't believe I ran into you guys here.
-I know.

359
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,257
Do you still do theater?

360
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,217
No, I'm a full-time mom now.

361
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,429
Right. You have a daughter.
Four years old, right?

362
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,306
She's six now.

363
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,725
Sorry. Already?

364
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,152
What…

365
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,286
What is this? What's going on?

366
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,540
It's so good to see you.

367
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,667
What are you all doing here?

368
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,752
Have you been well?

369
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,299
Hey, it's good to see you.

370
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,511
Chan-young.

371
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,451
Hey…

372
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,831
Gosh, I shouldn't cry.

373
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,215
Come here.

374
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,967
It's all right.

375
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,178
You look beautiful.

376
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,933
Goodness.

377
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,147
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,818
I shouldn't cry.

379
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,821
Mom, I can't stop crying.

380
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,534
Gosh.

381
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:10,248
I don't know what to say to you guys.

382
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,585
I really don't know.

383
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,798
It looks like…

384
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,553
you're all aware of my condition.

385
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,263
Right?

386
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:31,770
The thing is, I gave my friend a list

387
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,272
with all your names on it.

388
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,236
I asked her to call you guys
and tell you the news

389
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,948
once I was gone.

390
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,410
But my friends turned that list

391
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,954
into a brunch invitation list.

392
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,419
Well…

393
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:05,011
I would've prepared a nice speech
if they had given me a heads up.

394
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,057
Or maybe not.

395
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,976
No, maybe not.

396
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,773
If I had known,
I still wouldn't have known what to say.

397
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,237
But first and foremost,
I want to tell you guys

398
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,032
to always get medical checkups.
That's right.

399
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,368
Gosh, I really don't know what to say.

400
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,454
Well…

401
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,922
I just want to say…

402
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,596
that it was more than enough.

403
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,808
I'll probably…

404
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,438
only get to live half the amount
most people get to live.

405
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,566
But…

406
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,278
But it's quality over quantity.

407
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,948
It was more than enough for me.

408
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,659
I was loved by my parents.

409
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,289
I was cared for by the man I loved.

410
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,291
And my friends…

411
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,427
I received so much love from my friends.
More than enough.

412
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,637
And I still am.

413
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,267
Thanks to you guys,

414
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,229
my life couldn't have been better.

415
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,814
Thank you.

416
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,192
I thank you so much

417
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,571
from the bottom of my heart.

418
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,161
Thank you.

419
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,673
Chan-young.

420
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,009
It's snowing.

421
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:32,158
None of us cried.

422
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,920
We never promised not to cry…

423
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,595
but we all had smiles on our faces.

424
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,964
The flowers have bloomed.

425
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,851
It's spring.

426
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,853
Yes, it is.

427
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:48,651
Chan-young welcomed
the next spring with us.

428
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,694
A small store.

429
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:54,782
-And we all carried on with our lives.
-For nail art.

430
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,535
J DERMATOLOGY CLINIC

431
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,538
Dr. Cha, the next patient is in Room One.

432
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,169
Okay.

433
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:15,094
Feeling anxious every time
my phone had a notification,

434
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,432
I got through the spring.

435
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,687
And from a certain point,

436
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,816
I couldn't sleep with the lights off.

437
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,819
I was scared

438
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:36,282
I might miss something important
if I was fast asleep.

439
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,793
Are you asleep?

440
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,771
Do you have trouble sleeping?

441
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,941
Can you visit my parents
on their birthdays every year?

442
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,904
What should I get them?

443
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,280
Something expensive.

444
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,327
How much is expensive?

445
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,748
Okay.

446
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,168
I'll get them the most expensive gifts.

447
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,298
You're making good progress.

448
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,261
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO
DERMATOLOGIST

449
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,723
I'll write you a prescription.

450
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,685
Don't forget to apply
the ointment twice a day.

451
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,686
Okay, thank you.

452
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,312
Thank you. Bye.

453
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,446
Have my parents get medical checkups.

454
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,950
The one that I got.
The most expensive one.

455
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,005
YEARLY MEDICAL CHECKUP
FOR CHAN-YOUNG'S PARENTS

456
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,806
VISIT CHAN-YOUNG'S PARENTS
FOR THEIR BIRTHDAYS

457
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,104
I told you to just eat
what you want to eat.

458
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,483
I like porridge.

459
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,153
Liar.

460
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,498
Is it good?

461
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,541
Yes.

462
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,887
Have pork belly and soju
with Jin-seok at least once every week.

463
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,015
Once a week?

464
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,892
Come on.

465
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,519
Once a week is too often.

466
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,022
I don't even see my parents that often.

467
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,316
Once every two weeks.

468
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,109
Let's make it three.

469
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,070
Forget it.

470
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,531
Okay. Two weeks.

471
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,203
Whether it was
early in the morning or late at night,

472
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,166
I felt relieved whenever I got
a text from Chan-young.

473
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,379
And one night,

474
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,675
when I was feeling worried
that it might end at any moment…

475
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,851
JIN-SEOK

476
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,155
JIN-SEOK

477
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,208
Mom.

478
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,046
Mom…

479
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,465
What? What's wrong?

480
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,307
Goodness. Oh, dear.

481
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,812
Joo-hee…

482
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,947
Joo-hee…

483
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,251
That day,

484
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,341
in the dead of one spring night,

485
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,264
Chan-young…

486
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,604
left us.

487
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,862
But we didn't cry
as much as we thought we would.

488
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,658
And we moved on with our lives
more quickly than we expected.

489
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,413
Then winter came again.

490
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,126
CHINATOWN

491
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,252
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

492
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,296
-Let me show you to your table.
-Thank you.

493
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,756
Enjoy.

494
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,007
Thank you.

495
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,300
Excuse me.

496
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,385
Just a moment.

497
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,680
-Do you need anything?
-Yes.

498
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,689
Excuse me.

499
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,616
Mom, you can't cancel.

500
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,995
I purposely made a reservation
on the day you close your restaurant.

501
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,956
You have to come, okay?
I'll go pick you up.

502
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,375
There's no need.
We'll just drive there ourselves.

503
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,920
It's early in the morning,
so I'm worried the road might be icy.

504
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,757
Or we could go to Seoul
the day before after we close up

505
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,968
and sleep at Chan-young's place.

506
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,637
Oh, that's a good idea.

507
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,433
Anyway, I'll visit you next week.
We can talk about it then.

508
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,602
Next week? Why are you coming next week?

509
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,212
What's with you?
I told you to put it in the backseat.

510
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,465
No, you drive too rough.
You might ruin the cake.

511
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,218
Hey, you're the reckless driver.

512
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,347
Did you season the seaweed soup well?

513
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,811
You bought it, didn't you?

514
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,773
I tried really hard to cook it myself,

515
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,691
but it wasn't edible.

516
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,195
Gosh, that's why I said I'd do it.

517
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,781
I'll let you do it for her dad's birthday.

518
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,784
My gosh, you never listen.

519
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,581
Hyeon-jun.

520
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,959
Hey, where are you?

521
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,585
-Damn it.
-Yes.

522
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,462
Gosh, just a second.

523
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,633
My gosh, Mi-jo is losing it right now.

524
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:37,763
What? No, I said she's losing it!

525
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,306
This looks familiar.

526
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,434
Isn't this from that cake shop?

527
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,686
But…

528
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,230
What? You brought a cake too?

529
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,232
Mom, who got you this?

530
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,235
The cake shop owner.

531
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,361
I TOLD YOU I LOVED YOU

532
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,113
Chan-young asked her to do this.

533
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,120
What about those flowers?

534
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,791
Ma'am, I'm done washing the dishes.
Is there anything else…

535
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,210
Hey, guys.

536
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,921
Chan-young really prepared everything.

537
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,258
Mom, here's your gift.

538
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,428
My gosh, why do you keep bringing stuff?

539
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,055
I'm grateful enough
that you made time to come here.

540
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,600
What is it? Is it something delicious?

541
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,311
It's something expensive.

542
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,479
What?

543
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,857
Come on.

544
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,867
When are you leaving?

545
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,411
There's still some time left
until the semester starts,

546
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,663
but I'm going to go
ahead of time to adjust.

547
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,043
Are you staying there until you graduate?

548
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,670
I'll come for your wedding.

549
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,714
Oh, right.

550
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,884
I heard Father's coming early this year.

551
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,178
Yes.

552
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,263
He has plans here.

553
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,602
While he's here,
he's going to meet Mi-jo's parents.

554
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,230
I think that's
the main reason he's coming.

555
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,695
If he has time, it'd be nice
if he could come to the recital.

556
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,577
Can I bring him?

557
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,414
Do you think he'll come?

558
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,126
He'll love it.

559
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,350
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO
DERMATOLOGIST

560
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,278
BE HAPPY WITH SEON-U!

561
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,447
ONNURI CHILD CARE CENTER

562
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,482
I think I'm going to get married soon.

563
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,573
So I'm planning to move to a bigger place.

564
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,199
Okay.

565
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,373
So I came to ask you something.

566
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,250
How should we decorate your room?

567
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,691
Can we have
another bottle of soju, please?

568
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,319
Next time, let's have Chinese.
I'm an expert.

569
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,737
What do you say?

570
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,161
So we can't.

571
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,787
Why do you ask every time?

572
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,623
Just in case.

573
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,544
Can we please have
three more servings of pork belly?

574
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,379
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

575
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,897
Hey, Joo-hee.

576
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,317
You know it released today, right?
Should I buy the tickets?

577
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,905
Well, why don't you
watch it with Hyeon-jun first?

578
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,157
I have dinner plans tonight.

579
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,409
Yes.

580
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,957
I could watch it with Seon-u.

581
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,625
Or I could watch it with you.

582
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,293
I don't mind watching it twice.

583
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,212
Okay.

584
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,631
Bye.

585
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:38,021
WATCH HER MOVIE ON THE RELEASE DATE
AND GIVE IT FIVE STARS

586
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,323
SAFFRAN BLUE
STARRING: YIM SI-WAN, KIM JAE-HAN

587
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,912
Should we buy popcorn?

588
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,541
It gets in between my teeth.

589
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,710
Do you want soda?

590
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,756
You need to cut down on sugary drinks.

591
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,802
Then let's at least have popcorn.

592
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,762
I'll be right back.

593
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,023
YANGPYEONG CENTRAL CINEMA
SAFFRAN BLUE

594
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,784
It's Chan-young.

595
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,787
You really are persistent.

596
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,331
Chan-young's voice.

597
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,832
This will cause us trouble.

598
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,292
Filming is illegal.

599
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,877
Oh, right.

600
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,137
I found it.

601
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,483
I found evidence,
so I'm going to publish an exclusive.

602
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,567
Wait.

603
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,986
Are you really not going to meet Ji-yeon?

604
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,490
What's the point? All we ever do is fight.

605
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,117
Still, you should meet her.

606
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,245
She waited for you.

607
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,707
Is there something going on?

608
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,752
My daughter's so good.

609
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,047
Don't tell me…

610
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,632
The article will be out tomorrow.

611
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,636
I can't believe you did it.

612
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,805
You're insane.

613
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,516
The director will kill you
if he finds out.

614
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,767
You wrote the article?

615
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,063
So don't tell Ji-yeon that I'm here.
I'm leaving for the airport right away.

616
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,862
MERRY CHRISTMAS

617
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,730
I want you to decorate
a Christmas tree every year.

618
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,897
Okay.

619
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,400
Make sure it's pretty.

620
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,904
I'll come to see it every year.

621
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,949
And in spring,

622
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:37,951
plant flowers.

623
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,746
I'll come to see them every year.

624
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,421
I'll come visit you every season.

625
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,622
I miss her so much.

626
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,752
Chan-young.

627
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,299
I miss you.

628
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,438
Why aren't you watching it?

629
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,525
I'm going to.

630
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,985
It became a hit.

631
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,197
It'll be in theaters for quite a while.

632
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,491
That's good.

633
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,745
Chan-young's movie became a hit.

634
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,836
Why can't you watch it?

635
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,221
I feel so sorry.

636
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,937
That's why.

637
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,277
We will casket
Ms. Jeong Chan-young's body.

638
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,112
Family members, please gather.

639
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,158
I just…

640
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,453
feel so sorry

641
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,582
that I couldn't see her off.

642
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,488
Package delivery!

643
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,513
Hey, Mi-jo. You must be surprised.

644
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,184
I hope Joo-hee surprised you with this.

645
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,687
I made sure she would.

646
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,483
Chan-young's handwriting.

647
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,536
HEY, MI-JO. YOU MUST BE SURPRISED.
I HOPE JOO-HEE SURPRISED YOU WITH THIS.

648
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,664
This is for you.

649
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,166
And this is…

650
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,128
for Mi-jo.

651
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,881
What is this?

652
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,425
Give it to Mi-jo…

653
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,261
after I'm gone.

654
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,849
Give it to her when it seems
she's having a hard time.

655
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,361
Are you worried that Mi-jo

656
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,447
will keep hurting?

657
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,326
I am too.

658
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,539
Are you upset…

659
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,585
that I'm more worried about Mi-jo

660
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,755
than I am about you?

661
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,717
If I tell you that I am,

662
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,597
will you stay?

663
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,671
Hi.

664
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,340
It's me.

665
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,071
Is this awkward?

666
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,367
I feel awkward too.

667
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,288
This is pretty cliché, right?

668
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,958
We see it all the time in movies.

669
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,964
But still, I had a feeling it would work.

670
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,136
Do you know that feeling?

671
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,515
You know…

672
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,733
When you're overwhelmingly grateful,

673
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,113
you find it so hard
to express your gratitude.

674
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:20,455
You turned my funeral guest list
into a brunch invitation list.

675
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,921
Thank you so much, Mi-jo.

676
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,758
Thanks to you,

677
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,845
I got to have
the happiest funeral in the world.

678
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,559
Well…

679
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,479
Remember that I told you

680
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,565
I've been thinking
about you a lot these days?

681
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,403
That when I thought of you,
I felt reassured

682
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,489
and concerned at the same time.

683
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,535
Mi-jo.

684
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,372
I hope you're eating well

685
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,291
and no longer taking sleeping pills.

686
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,920
You're doing fine, right?

687
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,256
Yes.

688
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,510
I'm making this video just in case.

689
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,430
Just in case you might be struggling.

690
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,060
I'm not worried about Joo-hee.

691
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,522
But I am worried about you.

692
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,985
I guess I still can't forget

693
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,447
how nervous and sad you looked

694
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,325
the day we first met.

695
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,627
How are things
on the day you're watching this video?

696
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,423
Are things different now that you're 40?

697
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,137
Imagine how nice

698
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,433
it would've been for the three of us

699
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,894
to grow old together.

700
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,943
I really wanted that, you know.

701
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,493
But don't be sad
that I won't be here when you're 40.

702
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,538
Just think of me…

703
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,791
from time to time.

704
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,138
I miss you already.

705
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,601
Do you…

706
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,228
miss me too?

707
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,818
I miss you…

708
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,452
Mi-jo, you see…

709
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,415
To me, you are…

710
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:33,314
You're a very close friend…

711
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,276
and you're…

712
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:41,864
very precious to me.

713
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,667
What I mean is…

714
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,927
You are also…

715
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,850
very dear to me.

716
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,693
I miss you too.

717
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,030
I miss you so much.

718
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,666
I eat well.

719
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,335
And I still have trouble
sleeping sometimes,

720
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,630
but I don't take sleeping pills.

721
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,675
-It was you, wasn't it?
-I'm sorry.

722
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,553
I'm doing a lot better
than I thought I would.

723
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,763
No way.

724
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:47,889
Are you watching?

725
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,682
I had no idea.

726
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,480
How do I feel now that I'm 40?

727
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,482
I'm not sure.

728
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,280
Everything is the same.
The only difference is that you're gone.

729
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,925
And I'm still not used to the fact

730
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,969
that you're gone, Chan-young.

731
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,651
No.

732
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,904
I'm not drunk at all.

733
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,074
I didn't drink that much.

734
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:54,497
Gosh, I'll just take a cab.

735
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,504
I'll see you tomorrow, Seon-u.

736
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:02,797
Bye.

737
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:39,041
CHAN-YOUNG

738
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,223
When I call your number,

739
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,975
someone else picks up.

740
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,186
I know that, but sometimes,

741
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,899
when I miss you like crazy

742
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,611
and get drunk,

743
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,155
I call that number.

744
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,239
Hello?

745
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,366
Because it feels

746
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,120
like you might pick up.

747
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,457
Mi-jo fixed a wedding date.

748
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,376
She's catching the bouquet.

749
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,253
Will I be able to get married
in six months?

750
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:08,965
Just propose to him.

751
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,843
It's not easy
when you're older than the guy.

752
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,179
Help her out, Chan-young.

753
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,973
Or send her another guy.

754
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,432
Are you nuts?

755
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,727
Hyeon-jun and I are
in a serious relationship.

756
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,354
Why are you yelling at me?

757
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,564
Chan-young's watching.

758
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,483
You're the one who keeps teasing me.

759
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,026
When did I tease you?

760
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,111
Chan-young, see?

761
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,446
-She's so annoying these days.
-Are you serious?

762
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,365
-Her wedding preparations…
-Shut it.

763
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:35,449
At what age…

764
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,914
do you think
we'll get used to your absence?

765
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,835
I don't think…

766
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,338
that day will ever come.

767
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,431
We started out as three,
and now the two of us are left here…

768
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,519
missing you.

769
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,108
Chan-young.

770
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,986
We miss you a lot.

771
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:31,398
