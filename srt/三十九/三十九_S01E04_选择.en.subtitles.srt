00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,465
NIGHTCLUB

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,758
-Excited?
-Yes.

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,427
I'm so excited.

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,220
Are you here on a blind date or what?

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,140
Hey, your lips look way too sexy.
Pull up your top a little.

6
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,185
This is how you're supposed to dress
when you go to a nightclub.

7
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,520
-Whatever.
-Gosh, seriously.

8
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,647
-What's taking her so long?
-I know, right?

9
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,399
-My gosh, come on.
-Guys.

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,401
Hey.

11
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,571
I'm sorry. I ran over as fast as I could.

12
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,699
What are you…

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,288
It's all right.
What matters is that she's here.

14
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,956
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,291
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

16
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,209
Come on.

17
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,464
This is so exciting. My heart's racing.

18
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,965
We're going to a nightclub.

19
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,177
-What's wrong?
-Sorry?

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,352
Cut me some slack.

21
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,938
I barely managed to get out.

22
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,607
My professor was glaring at me.

23
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,777
I put my life on the line to come here.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,945
Don't worry about it.

25
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:56,074
At least Mi-jo will make sure
we look pretty in the future.

26
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,327
I just wanted to go
to a nightclub for the first time.

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,870
Was that too much to ask for?

28
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,816
Don't bother.

29
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,736
We're never going to a nightclub again.

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,780
Don't even try to take me.

31
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,615
You were the one who suggested it.

32
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,871
Anyway, let's just drink soju
like we always do.

33
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,039
Don't be angry.

34
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,001
We can try again next time.

35
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,002
Not with you guys.

36
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,378
You can go with me.

37
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,046
No, thanks.

38
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,300
I promise I'll dress up nicely.

39
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,551
Forget it.

40
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,303
Here. Let's drink.

41
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,513
My glass is empty.

42
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,018
The birthday girl shouldn't be
holding an empty glass. Here.

43
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,895
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

44
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:12,984
CHOICE

45
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,780
Your CT scans showed cysts
in your pancreas and liver,

46
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,992
so we carried out an extra test
to check if it was pancreatic cancer.

47
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:25,246
Unfortunately,
the CA19-9 levels were high,

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,497
and your PET scans showed

49
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,501
high metabolic activity of cancer cells
in your pancreas and liver.

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,505
Your final biopsy also tells us
that you do have cancer.

51
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,427
In other words,
you have stage four pancreatic cancer.

52
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,397
If it's stage four,

53
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,692
how likely is it…

54
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,070
that I'll live?

55
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,408
You can tell me.

56
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,747
Patients with stage four pancreatic cancer

57
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,626
have an average survival rate
of 0.8 percent.

58
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,347
How long do I have…

59
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,184
until I'm no longer able

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,231
to eat or go to the bathroom on my own?

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,442
One year if you undergo chemotherapy.

62
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,404
If you don't, you have about six months.

63
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,167
I know…

64
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,172
I know he said 0.8 percent but--

65
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,799
I'm not getting chemo.

66
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,883
Chan-young.

67
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802
Let's go.

68
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,056
Chan-young.

69
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,184
EPISODE 4

70
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,894
Chan-young.

71
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,607
Why won't you get treated?

72
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,153
Didn't you hear him?

73
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,281
The survival rate is 0.8 percent.

74
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,910
It still means there's
a possibility that you might live.

75
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,412
How do you know?

76
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,289
I might not make it.

77
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,625
Still, you should try everything--

78
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,294
No.

79
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,297
Don't you know?

80
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,926
You know what chemotherapy does to people.

81
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,972
I don't want to die
living the rest of my life in a hospital.

82
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,974
Why do you keep implying
you're going to die?

83
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,309
It's not your life.

84
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,103
If you were me, you'd do the same.

85
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,689
You can still discuss it.

86
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,400
Why would I discuss it with anyone?
It's my life.

87
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,777
What about your parents?

88
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,154
What about me and Joo-hee?

89
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,574
Don't bring up my parents.
That's not fair.

90
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,658
Whatever.

91
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,579
I'm going to go to Yangpyeong
and discuss this with your parents.

92
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,289
You have no business going there!

93
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,665
Hey.

94
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,345
JOO-HEE

95
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,773
JOO-HEE

96
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,069
Let's drop it. This is making me dizzy.

97
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,905
I'll decide for myself.

98
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,490
It's not that simple.

99
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,617
Why are you being so stubborn?

100
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,287
I just heard
that I'll be dead in six months.

101
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,249
So I'm pretty serious.

102
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,625
You're not going to die!

103
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,474
I won fourth place in the lottery.

104
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,226
I'm getting 7,500,000 won.

105
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,019
Let's meet up tonight.

106
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,896
Meet me at Chinatown.

107
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,245
Let's go.

108
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,308
Gosh, I needed a break.

109
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,685
-You must be tired.
-My shoulders hurt.

110
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,353
Let me massage them for you.

111
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,521
Here.

112
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,064
-Please be gentle.
-Did it hurt?

113
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,775
Stay there. I'll answer it.

114
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,110
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

115
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,074
You've reached Chinatown.

116
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,076
Oh, hello.

117
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,703
Yes.

118
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,165
Dinner?

119
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,751
I'll order the most expensive dish.
Something delicious.

120
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,628
Oh, is it your birthday?

121
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,922
No, not exactly.

122
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,590
Well…

123
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,261
I actually won the lottery.

124
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,721
That's amazing.

125
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,806
I'll have to cook you
something really nice.

126
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,767
Yes.

127
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,228
Bye.

128
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,191
Is someone having a birthday party here?

129
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,485
No, it's not a birthday party.

130
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,571
You deserve a birthday party though.

131
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,615
I'll make you something nice.
Bring your friends.

132
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,283
I'll close up that day.

133
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,868
Why would you do that?

134
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,287
Birthdays come around every year.

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,083
I'll just go somewhere
and have beer with a few of my friends.

136
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,085
Come on. You should drink here.

137
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,837
Look. It's packed with beer.

138
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,591
No, it's okay.
None of us can drink that much anyway.

139
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,927
Don't worry about it.

140
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,889
BANKBOOK

141
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,725
LOTTERY TICKET

142
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,857
My gosh, this is crazy.

143
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,694
I won 7,500,000 won!

144
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,081
Can I see it?

145
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,125
I've never seen a winning ticket.

146
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,334
It's at home.

147
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,420
Gosh, that's too bad.

148
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,256
What did you dream of
the day before you bought the ticket?

149
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,049
Nothing.

150
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,175
Really?

151
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,847
Apparently, my friend kept
peeing and pooping in his dream.

152
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,932
Gosh, that's gross.

153
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,727
Sorry.

154
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,313
-Gosh.
-Did you really not dream of anything?

155
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,982
My gosh, stop asking.
I really didn't dream of anything.

156
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,651
Don't tell her today.

157
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,778
How am I going to hide it?

158
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,782
Look at her. Look how happy she looks.

159
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,330
You should take a look at yourself too.

160
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,306
I want to say something,
but you'll probably give me shit about it.

161
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,265
What?

162
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,392
That they look good together?

163
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,313
See? We totally click.

164
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,523
So stop fussing over chemo.

165
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,901
If you were a guy,

166
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,236
I would've married you for sure.

167
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,033
I don't want to marry someone
who won't get treatment.

168
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,454
Well, I don't want to marry
a golf fanatic.

169
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,335
If you were my significant other,

170
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,003
I wouldn't have gotten sick.

171
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,925
You have no idea how excited I was.

172
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,177
I mean, you guys know me.

173
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,680
I normally don't get lucky
with this kind of stuff.

174
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,974
I've written so many online reviews,

175
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,477
but I never once won a prize.

176
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,772
I also sent tons of letters
to radio channels,

177
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,692
but not once did my letter get chosen.

178
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,903
So I seriously can't believe

179
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,698
that I got lucky this time.

180
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,452
Maybe it all added up and came at once.

181
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,250
Gosh, look at how excited you are.

182
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,585
Come on.

183
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,670
Oh, right.

184
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,930
What are you going to do
with the 7,500,000 won?

185
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,724
Well, I'm going to pay for tonight.

186
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,184
Then I'll get my mom a gift

187
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,228
and save the rest.

188
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,773
Save it? Just spend it all.

189
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,692
Don't be absurd.

190
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,944
I'm single with no kids.

191
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,612
I should save up.

192
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,240
You already have tons of savings accounts.
Why save more?

193
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,159
Buy yourself a handbag.

194
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,077
What for? I have no one to show it off to.

195
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,038
Carry it around and meet other people.

196
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,665
Gosh, stop nagging.

197
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,834
Let's drink. Cheers.

198
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,760
Chan-young, why aren't you drinking?

199
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,681
A glass won't hurt.

200
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,849
No.

201
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,893
What's the matter?

202
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,313
She doesn't seem well today.

203
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,482
Really? What's wrong? Are you sick?

204
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,359
No, it's nothing.

205
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,995
You guys need to stop.

206
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,208
-What?
-I mean, come on.

207
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,044
I'm always the last
to learn about important things.

208
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,173
When did that ever happen?

209
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,426
I don't exactly keep records,
but that's just how it is.

210
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,516
Joo-hee.

211
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,936
Chan-young is sick.

212
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,771
It's bad.

213
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,065
Hey, stop it.

214
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,488
We're here to congratulate Joo-hee.
Don't ruin it.

215
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,198
Just tell me.

216
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,868
Remember that day when I went
to see you at the department store?

217
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,038
Yes. You were acting weird that day.

218
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,249
I went to discuss things with you,

219
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,377
but you had plans
with your mother the next day.

220
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,093
Why can't you just tell me?

221
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,136
Is it serious?

222
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,312
I have cancer.

223
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,698
My mom had cancer too.

224
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,825
But she's all better now.

225
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,619
In my case…

226
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,706
it's pretty bad.

227
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,500
How bad?

228
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,505
How bad is it?

229
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,467
I have about six months left.

230
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,179
What do you mean?

231
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,308
To live.

232
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,072
You'd better not be joking.
If it is, I'll kill…

233
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,824
I'll get upset.

234
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,329
Joo-hee, will you try
and convince Chan-young?

235
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,747
She's refusing chemo.

236
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,213
You guys are serious.

237
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,155
CHINATOWN

238
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,328
From now on,
let's meet near Chan-young's place.

239
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,623
My mom is all better now.
We don't need to meet in my neighborhood.

240
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,250
Bye.

241
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,802
The driver is almost here.

242
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,136
You can go.

243
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,430
I'm going to take a cab. I'm tired.

244
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,016
Let me drop you off at your place.

245
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,812
Hey, that's enough.
It's not like I'm dying today.

246
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,815
Will you stop saying that?

247
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,942
Okay, fine. I'll stop.

248
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,026
There's a cab.

249
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,449
See you.

250
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,224
Don't worry about the clinic.

251
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,477
WATCH
CALL

252
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,321
I just read your text.

253
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,614
Were there a lot of patients?

254
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,367
I had to treat my patients and yours.

255
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,578
You must be exhausted.

256
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,663
Where are you?

257
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,834
Joo-hee's neighborhood.
I'm about to head home.

258
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,127
Where are you?

259
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,463
I'm at the clinic.

260
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,672
Why are you still there?

261
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,799
I wanted to avoid traffic.

262
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,095
Can you wait for me?

263
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,359
I bet you had a hectic day.

264
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,697
Let's have tea.

265
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,718
How were…

266
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,763
Chan-young's test results?

267
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,140
Pancreatic cancer.

268
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,185
It's stage four.

269
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,772
That's bad.

270
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,399
Chan-young is refusing

271
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,902
to undergo chemotherapy.

272
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,864
I understand why,

273
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,867
but she can't just sit back
and do nothing.

274
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,204
It must be hard.

275
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,670
I'm not sure how I can help.

276
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,715
This isn't related to you.

277
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,136
I'm upset.

278
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,475
I was worried about you all day.

279
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,728
I wondered if you two had arrived
at the hospital on time,

280
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,355
if the test results came out okay,

281
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,900
and how hard it must be for you
to watch your friend suffer.

282
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,238
I was really worried.

283
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,785
So it's upsetting to hear you say
that it isn't related to me.

284
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,872
You were…

285
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,916
worried about me?

286
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,669
Of course.

287
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,172
Why?

288
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,425
Like I told you already,

289
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,553
I like you.

290
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,347
Life…

291
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,517
is hard.

292
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,270
To be honest,

293
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,899
my heart skips a beat

294
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,526
whenever you…

295
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,112
say things like that.

296
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,324
My heart flutters.

297
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,453
But at the same time,

298
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,248
my friend is really sick.

299
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,090
It makes me so sad.

300
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,515
It's so hard.

301
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:53,543
I feel comfortable
for the first time today.

302
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,601
Where did I put my wallet?

303
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,896
Gosh, I hope I didn't lose it.

304
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,986
What? Is someone still working?

305
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,694
Mom, I'm heading home.

306
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,157
Can you pay for my cab fare
later at home? I lost my wallet.

307
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,076
You sound awfully happy
for someone who lost her wallet.

308
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,829
I know, right? I feel really happy.

309
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,707
I don't know why though. I have no idea.

310
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,710
Dad, I'm home.

311
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,794
Hey.

312
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
Did you report
that your card went missing?

313
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,467
What took you so long to find out
that you had lost your wallet?

314
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,469
I had dinner with a friend
near the clinic,

315
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,180
and we went to have coffee,
but I didn't have my wallet.

316
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,639
My friend paid for dinner.

317
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,601
How about some soju?

318
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,227
Sounds good.

319
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,938
You two are unbelievable.

320
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,110
Hurry up and report that it went missing.
Think of everything in your wallet.

321
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,361
It might be at the clinic.

322
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,197
Why didn't you go there?

323
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,657
I couldn't. I couldn't go inside.

324
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,742
Why not?

325
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,495
I just couldn't. I'll tell you next time.

326
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,455
Dad, what should we eat?

327
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,838
-Shall we drink?
-Yes.

328
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,009
Let's eat first.

329
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,928
MOM

330
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,443
JIN-SEOK

331
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,338
I told you I don't want to get a divorce.

332
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,216
Fine. Then let's just talk to our lawyer.

333
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,302
-Honey.
-I'm going to sleep in Ju-won's room.

334
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,846
What do you mean?

335
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,143
You told me

336
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,020
that you knew everything.

337
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,939
What does that mean?

338
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,193
Why did you say that?
It's making me feel uneasy.

339
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,747
Don't get me wrong.

340
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,419
The reason I want a divorce
is solely for my sake.

341
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,378
Nothing else.

342
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,674
Can you be clearer?

343
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,092
It's not because of Ju-won.

344
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,308
I only stayed with you because of Ju-won.

345
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,352
-I wanted him to be well and healthy.
-What do you mean?

346
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,563
You know what I mean.

347
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,689
Honey.

348
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,691
Lower your voice. You'll wake Ju-won.

349
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,235
I don't get what you mean.

350
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,364
You were never a loving mother to Ju-won.

351
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,828
What are you talking about?

352
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,294
You're the only one who can't see
how cold you are to him.

353
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,589
You think of him as a burden.

354
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,965
And when you're drunk,

355
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,718
you look at him like you resent him.

356
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,929
-Do I?
-Why?

357
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,015
He did nothing wrong.

358
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,686
Let's talk next time.

359
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm done talking.
Let's just get a divorce quietly.

360
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,069
-Honey.
-I get that you love me.

361
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,445
I'm grateful for that.

362
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,863
But…

363
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,535
if you hadn't gotten pregnant,
I wouldn't have married you.

364
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,208
Are you saying

365
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,961
you stayed married for Ju-won?

366
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,171
Fine.

367
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,675
Then just stay married.
Why do you want a divorce all of a sudden?

368
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,176
Because of that wench?

369
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,803
Watch what you say.

370
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,682
Ju-won, Chan-young, and I are all victims.

371
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,684
You owe everyone an apology.

372
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,067
I'll take custody of Ju-won.

373
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,446
You can have everything else
including the house and the land.

374
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,534
It seems like you know everything.

375
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,162
So why take Ju-won?

376
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,665
He's not even your son.

377
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,051
He came into my life,
which means he's mine.

378
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,679
If you tell Ju-won,

379
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,973
I'll make sure you leave with nothing.

380
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,851
You have no right to raise Ju-won.

381
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,288
Are you serious?

382
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,748
Maybe you were mistaken.

383
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,169
I have a visual acuity of 1.0 and 1.2.

384
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,588
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes?

385
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:18,094
This is what he was doing.
He was hugging her like this.

386
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,763
Then he patted her.

387
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,515
Judging by the way he patted her,

388
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,061
I could tell that they were pretty close.
It wasn't awkward at all.

389
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,189
My gut tells me
that they're already a thing.

390
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,691
Is he a decent guy?

391
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,361
He's totally a catch.

392
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,237
Mom, the moment you see him,

393
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,531
you'll be able to tell right away

394
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,367
that he's honest and upright.

395
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,827
I think he's going to be
a great son-in-law.

396
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,496
Hey, wait.

397
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:49,084
What if he goes back to the States
and takes Mi-jo with him?

398
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,878
If he was going to go back,

399
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,547
he wouldn't have taken the KMLE.

400
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,926
I'm sure he got a Korean medical license
with plans to settle down here.

401
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,470
I should go to the clinic
and check him out.

402
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,347
No, you shouldn't.

403
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,307
You know Mi-jo.

404
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,768
If she finds out that we know,

405
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,396
she might just back away from everything.

406
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,398
Yes, you have a point.

407
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,982
Honey, don't go there.

408
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,275
Just let her be.

409
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,615
Don't do anything rash.

410
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,708
What can I help you with today?

411
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,170
I'm here because of my athlete's foot.

412
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,089
-Let's take a look.
-Okay.

413
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,052
Let me take a look.

414
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,521
Your foot seems fine.

415
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,190
I think it was the other foot.

416
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,445
-Here.
-Okay.

417
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,572
Let's see.

418
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,785
I'm not sure what you mean. It looks fine.

419
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,705
You really are an excellent doctor.

420
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,874
-Pardon?
-It's fully treated, right?

421
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,834
I'm surprised you noticed.

422
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,631
Dad.

423
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,467
Hey, Mi-hyeon.

424
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,346
Gosh, you're unbelievable.
What are you doing here?

425
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,475
I was worried about your wallet,
so I came to check.

426
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,853
He's Dr. Cha's father?

427
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,481
Hello, sir. My name is Kim Seon-u.

428
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,150
Goodness, you don't need
to address me so formally.

429
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,195
"Dr. Cha" sounds a bit too formal as well.

430
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,279
Right, Ms. Cha?

431
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,072
That's even worse coming from you.

432
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,367
-My gosh. Come with me.
-No, wait. Hey.

433
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,994
I'm sorry.

434
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,704
-Goodbye, sir.
-I'm so sorry.

435
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,374
What's the matter with you?

436
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,225
Is that for me?

437
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,726
Yes, it's healthy.

438
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,271
Give me something healthy and delicious.

439
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,565
It's delicious.

440
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,611
Don't you have work?

441
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,404
The competent Dr. Kim is there.

442
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,740
We're getting more patients
without me there. Sit.

443
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,742
Let's eat.

444
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,369
When are you going to the States?

445
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,620
Just leave already.

446
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,289
I'm trying to find a place to stay.

447
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,876
But I don't like any of them.
They're so expensive.

448
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,170
I'll pay. Just go. Please.

449
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,421
I'll deal with it.

450
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,099
Hey, I'm bored.
Should we go to the hospital?

451
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,270
-Do you have a death wish?
-No.

452
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,982
I think my condition is
getting worse because of you.

453
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,066
Will you just leave?

454
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,277
Do you not feel well?

455
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,153
You make me feel unwell.

456
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,864
Where are you going?

457
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,865
A private lesson.

458
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,075
Oh, a private lesson?

459
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:14,122
I guess you won't be able
to work for a while. Right?

460
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,126
You'd better not
say anything to the actors.

461
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,210
Have fun here.

462
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,629
Wait for me.

463
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:31,514
I'll be your driver until I go to the US.
I'll be your manager.

464
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,434
Mi-jo.

465
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,187
-Yes?
-You need to give me some time.

466
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,151
I'm confused too.

467
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,696
So give me some time to think.

468
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,157
Sorry.

469
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,329
If I give you time to think,

470
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,998
will you get treated?

471
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,207
No.

472
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,834
I've made up my mind.

473
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,963
I want to live a normal life
while I'm still alive.

474
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,466
That's what I want, so drop it.

475
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,510
Just live your life.

476
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,888
If you keep doing this,

477
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,475
it makes me think
that I'm really going to die soon.

478
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,314
Did I upset you?

479
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,526
No.

480
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,486
Then stop the car.

481
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,072
What?

482
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,907
I'm going to take a cab.

483
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,535
If you're bored,
go see Joo-hee at the department store.

484
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,704
She's probably crying her eyes out.

485
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,929
Hey, can you give me five more minutes?

486
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,767
Okay. I'll be right there.

487
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,456
NOVEMBER 10, 2018
IT HAS BEEN 3 MONTHS SINCE MY DIAGNOSIS…

488
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,754
A NEW EMAIL HAS ARRIVED

489
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,874
Ji-yeon, take my photo.

490
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,875
Let's go.

491
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,295
You look so pretty.

492
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,047
-Do I look like Miss Korea?
-Totally.

493
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,382
-My gosh.
-Look. What are you doing?

494
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,009
-Hey.
-This place looks great.

495
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,260
Let's take one here.

496
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,097
-Hey, come on.
-Let's open the cake.

497
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,767
Thank you so much for coming, you guys.

498
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,018
-Cheers.
-Happy birthday.

499
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,561
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

500
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,772
You're here.

501
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,108
We wanted to surprise you.

502
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,527
He's so good-looking.

503
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,696
You should've told me.

504
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,365
-Come sit down.
-Excuse me, everyone.

505
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,452
-My goodness.
-What is it?

506
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,536
What did she get?

507
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,996
It's beautiful.

508
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,831
-That looks expensive.
-It's so pretty.

509
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,042
-I love that brand.
-It's really pretty.

510
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,294
He's the chief chef at Hanguk Hotel.

511
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,880
Hyeon-jun, can you also
introduce me to a hotel chef?

512
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,346
Italian cuisine or Korean cuisine?

513
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,349
I like Japanese cuisine.

514
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,433
Japanese cuisine?

515
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,812
The chefs there aren't
as charming as I am.

516
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,397
-How about Western cuisine?
-Western cuisine?

517
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,276
I guess the chefs there aren't that bad.

518
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,861
But Chinese cuisine is the best.

519
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,696
-It's the best.
-I'll go with Chinese.

520
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,739
Chinese cuisine?

521
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,501
Joo-hee, are you on your way
to see Chan-young right now?

522
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,297
I thought I'd join you.

523
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,384
You're already in front of her studio?

524
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,761
Okay. I'll be right there.

525
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,116
Chan-young.

526
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,371
Oh, gosh.
I didn't know you were here, Jin-seok.

527
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,040
Hey.

528
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,626
What's all this?

529
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,423
They're mushrooms, probiotics,
and some other stuff

530
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,717
that are good for your health.

531
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,051
I got some for Chan-young

532
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,054
while getting some for my mom.

533
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,515
But why did you buy so much?

534
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,100
I've been lethargic.

535
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,854
That's probably why. Give them to Mi-jo.

536
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,648
I bought enough for everyone.

537
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,491
I should go now. I need to meet Mi-jo.

538
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,078
Why don't you eat with…

539
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,622
Did… Did you eat?

540
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,790
-Me?
-Yes.

541
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,001
She's on a diet.

542
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,754
Yes. I'm on a diet.

543
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,048
-Oh, okay.
-See you next time, Jin-seok.

544
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,508
-I'll see you. Bye.
-Bye.

545
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,177
-Bye.
-Bye.

546
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,105
Hey, Joo-hee.

547
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,565
Don't come.

548
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,735
I also just left
because Jin-seok was inside.

549
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,654
Jin-seok is there?

550
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,198
Chan-young shouldn't get stressed.

551
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,284
They also need time to sort things out.

552
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,664
Where are you headed now?
Should I go see you?

553
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,501
Mi-jo, I'm actually really tired

554
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,461
because I cried so much.

555
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,089
I think I should go home and sleep.

556
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,802
Okay. Get some rest.
I don't want you getting sick as well.

557
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,013
You too. Take good care of yourself.
Good night.

558
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,098
Good night.

559
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,366
Hey.

560
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,286
I thought you went home early.

561
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,912
No, I just had to go somewhere.

562
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,915
-Let's go.
-Where to?

563
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,250
You'll see.

564
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,044
What…

565
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,380
Come in.

566
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,467
Why are you nervous?

567
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,553
Just tell me why we're here.

568
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,596
If I'm not up for it--

569
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,889
-Just come.
-But…

570
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,266
Come on.

571
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,518
-Take your shoes off.
-What…

572
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,603
Come inside. Come on.

573
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,444
Let's play a game. A 10,000-won bet.

574
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,363
Seriously?

575
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,992
I'm not in the mood to play games.

576
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,330
Come with me. Take off your shoes.

577
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,124
Why are you
suddenly making me play a game?

578
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,294
Just one round. Sit down.

579
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,506
If you don't like it,
we'll just go for a run.

580
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,093
Would you rather play a game

581
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,928
or go for a hardcore run?

582
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,475
It's a lot more comfortable
and nicer than an internet café.

583
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,559
Don't you think so?

584
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,480
It is comfortable.

585
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,692
Apparently, this game is really fun.
I heard it's popular.

586
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,652
Oh, wait.

587
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,075
Here.
You also need to take your money out.

588
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,205
If I bet money, I'll become competitive.

589
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,874
Just don't cry after you lose.

590
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,086
You'd better not
ask me for your money back.

591
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,420
It won't work.

592
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,465
I quit playing games a long time ago.

593
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,385
But I guess I could use your money
to run the clinic.

594
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,012
How much was it?

595
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,597
-Ten thousand won.
-Ten thousand?

596
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,809
Let's double it.

597
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,936
Deal.

598
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,731
Here.

599
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,239
-Gosh, that hurts.
-Are you okay?

600
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,868
What was that?

601
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,745
Come on.

602
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,872
-Hey, pause.
-No way.

603
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,541
I'm winning.

604
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,876
How are you so good?

605
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,629
What?

606
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,840
Did you play games and not study?

607
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,259
Look who's talking.

608
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,345
I haven't tried this hard to win in ages.

609
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,015
Aren't you hungry?

610
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,059
Yes, a little.

611
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,686
What did you eat at internet cafés?

612
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,357
Cup noodles.

613
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,568
Triangular gimbap.

614
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,404
Oh, fish cake bars.

615
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,281
I'm not even surprised.

616
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,323
What?

617
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,580
Let's see.

618
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,050
Don't get excited yet.

619
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,682
Ta-da.

620
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,351
I told you that you won't regret it.

621
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,480
-Should I heat the fish cake bars?
-But not too hot.

622
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,899
You know how to eat fish cake bars.

623
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,859
There we go.

624
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,455
Why…

625
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,582
Why are you making me repeat myself?

626
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:46,086
You're like a brother to me now.

627
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,631
You don't make my heart flutter.

628
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,675
I'll deal with everything.
Don't let it bother you.

629
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm just giving you a heads up.

630
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,472
Why now?

631
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,726
Why not earlier?

632
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,603
I'm sorry.

633
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,691
I haven't even told my son yet,
and my parents are going to be furious.

634
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,944
Can't you just tell me
I'm making the right choice?

635
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,070
No.

636
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,030
Just stay married.

637
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,242
It's pointless.
I can't take responsibility anymore.

638
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,453
You don't need to take responsibility.
I'm not a kid.

639
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,163
I'm sorry.

640
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,375
I'm sorry I asked you to get a divorce.

641
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,918
I didn't mean it.

642
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,755
I'm really sorry. So please just stop.

643
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,591
Chan-young, I have…

644
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,970
a secret to tell you.

645
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,103
Me too.

646
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,528
If we bet on whose secret is
more shocking and sad,

647
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,030
I bet I'll win.

648
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,075
No, I'll win.

649
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:10,879
Go ahead.

650
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,221
It's about Ju-won.

651
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,307
What about him? Is he sick?

652
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:22,891
No.

653
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,107
I found out when he was four

654
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,776
that he wasn't my son.

655
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:39,992
Remember when I used to drink
all the time? That was when.

656
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,502
I don't believe this.

657
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,881
Does Ju-won know?

658
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,676
No, he doesn't.

659
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,346
And I want to keep it that way.

660
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,181
But I guess he'll find out one day.

661
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,308
So what?

662
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,062
You're suddenly going to get a divorce

663
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,772
because of that?

664
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,440
I'm going to raise him.

665
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,109
He's still my son.

666
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,528
I don't care about genes.

667
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,198
I changed his diapers and fed him.

668
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,491
That makes me his dad.

669
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,370
How did you manage
to endure it all, Jin-seok?

670
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,457
I should've…

671
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,879
done this a long time ago.

672
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,798
But Ju-won was too young.

673
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,300
I mean, he's still young.

674
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:41,929
I guess…

675
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,351
this is why I like you.

676
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,065
You're not even that good-looking.

677
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,401
Let's get one thing straight.

678
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,362
I'm decent-looking.

679
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:03,992
Hey.

680
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:08,872
It's your turn to tell me
your shocking and sad secret.

681
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,957
What is it?

682
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,423
Come on.

683
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,641
I…

684
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,818
I have pancreatic cancer.

685
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,406
It's stage four.

686
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,034
The survival rate…

687
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,665
is 0.8 percent.

688
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,691
What?

689
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,571
What? You? Why?

690
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,671
Why you?

691
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,302
Why…

692
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,096
See?

693
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,186
I told you I'd win.

694
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,024
So Jin-seok…

695
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,029
Don't get a divorce.

696
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,661
Why is this happening to you?

697
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,543
I'm sorry.

698
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,981
Out of ingredients?

699
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,107
CLOSED

700
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,901
I guess business is flourishing.

701
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,200
Did he forget to turn off the lights?

702
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,898
You're a chef. You could've
cooked something better for yourself.

703
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,900
Why were you drinking alone?

704
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,944
No reason.

705
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,739
Did you get your money?

706
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,367
I didn't go to the bank yet.

707
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,787
Tomorrow is my day off,
so maybe I'll go tomorrow.

708
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,958
Why did you look so upset yesterday?

709
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,505
You look a lot more upset right now.

710
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,810
Today is my girlfriend's birthday.

711
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,896
What?

712
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,608
Then what are you doing here?
You should be spending time with her.

713
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,027
That was my plan…

714
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,988
but things got awkward for her.

715
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,907
Why?

716
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,370
Before I opened this restaurant,
I used to work at Hanguk Hotel.

717
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,665
I guess she prefers me as a hotel chef.

718
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,209
Her friends still think

719
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,128
I work at the hotel.

720
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,255
It didn't bother me,

721
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,052
but Hye-jin seemed so sorry about it,
and it made me feel bad.

722
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,442
Hotel chefs do seem a bit cooler.

723
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,278
It's because she's still young.

724
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,197
Later on, she'll understand.

725
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,829
Oh, cheers.

726
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,092
Yesterday…

727
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:16,388
was supposed to be
a really exciting day for me,

728
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,599
but I ended up
hearing something really sad.

729
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,395
You know Chan-young, right?

730
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:26,606
She was here last time.
The girl with short hair.

731
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,984
Oh, right. She's cool.

732
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,068
Right.

733
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,072
Chan-young, that cool friend of mine…

734
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,244
is terminally ill.

735
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,039
Stage four pancreatic cancer is just…

736
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,186
We should meet up and drink sometimes.

737
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,522
I'll talk about my girlfriend.

738
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,942
You can talk about your friend.

739
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,696
If we talk about it like this,

740
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,657
it might make us feel better.

741
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,370
Why aren't you using honorifics?

742
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,124
-When did I do that?
-Just now.

743
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,043
You talked to me without honorifics.

744
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,088
I was pretty much just talking to myself.

745
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,174
My gosh, you're so sensitive.

746
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,968
What's wrong?
Am I acting like an older sister again?

747
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,345
No, that was…

748
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,432
I should've known better.

749
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,892
I'm sorry.

750
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:50,607
Sure. Let's meet up
and drink like this sometimes.

751
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,820
We're neighbors, and I'm a regular here.

752
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,822
So it wouldn't be too bad.

753
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,157
See?
You didn't use honorifics just now either.

754
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,660
You completely left it out.

755
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,704
My gosh, you know how to hold a grudge.

756
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,456
Gosh, seriously.

757
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,459
-Let's drink.
-Sure.

758
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,169
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, ma'am.

759
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,182
Good night.

760
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,934
I hope you get a good night's sleep.

761
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:30,814
I want to…

762
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,192
thank you so much for today.

763
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,153
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

764
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,531
Thanks to you,

765
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:44,035
I was able to organize my thoughts.

766
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,747
I set that game up just for you,
so you're welcome whenever.

767
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,751
Tell me beforehand if you crave anything.
I'll go get it from the convenience store.

768
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,213
Okay. Goodbye, then.

769
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,302
Drive safely.

770
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,262
I will.

771
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,766
Why did you want me
to come from the clinic?

772
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,477
Do you have a big announcement to make?

773
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:53,855
Yes.

774
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,193
This is going to be serious.

775
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,488
I want you all to brace yourselves.

776
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,912
Why are you guys smiling?

777
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,081
I'm serious.

778
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,708
Yes, we know. We're concentrating.

779
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,794
Yes, that's right.

780
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,800
I'm not going to the States.
There's something I need to do here.

781
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,886
What do you need to do?
Can you be more specific?

782
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,517
Stop smiling.

783
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,936
-I'm being serious.
-Okay.

784
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,813
-Was I smiling?
-Stop.

785
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,648
I don't know why I was smiling.

786
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,738
My sabbatical is
going to be a bit different.

787
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,739
Great.

788
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,410
Whatever it is, you can do it here.

789
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,995
Spend a great sabbatical.

790
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,331
Do whatever you need to do
to get some good rest.

791
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,792
So what is it that you're going to do?

792
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,753
Why do you think she decided to stay?

793
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,005
Stop it.

794
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,339
During my sabbatical,

795
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,300
I'm going to take care of my friend.

796
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,560
Dad.

797
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,645
Mom.

798
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,606
Mi-hyeon.

799
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,529
Chan-young…

800
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,365
is terminally ill.

801
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,547
I'm here for you.

802
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,342
I'll help you with anything you need.

803
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,596
Don't cry. I'm right here.

804
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,057
It must've been hard to decide.

805
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:58,354
You made the right choice.
You should take care of your friend.

806
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,566
I'll get you some tonics.
You need energy to do that.

807
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,692
That's right.

808
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,122
Let's all meet up
at Chan-young's studio today.

809
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,167
I went to the bank.
You know what that means, right?

810
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,515
The lottery?

811
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,852
Joo-hee must be so happy.

812
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,832
Chan-young.

813
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,210
You guys are so annoying.
I'm going to change my number.

814
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,753
I'm asking you one last time.

815
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,505
Are you going to get chemo or not?

816
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:09,884
I'm telling you for the last time. No.
Ask me one more time, and we're done.

817
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,387
Okay.

818
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,606
What was that?

819
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,817
They won't leave me alone.

820
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,945
Both Mi-jo and Joo-hee are unbelievable.

821
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,906
Thanks to you guys, I'm not bored.

822
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,860
MOM

823
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:36,763
I'll take this.

824
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,847
Okay.

825
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,978
I'll take everything from here to there.

826
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,438
I want this in 245mm,

827
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,482
this in 230mm,

828
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,317
and this in 235mm.

829
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,027
Okay, I'll have them ready for you.

830
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,222
Why were you so desperate to meet me?

831
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,643
Are you getting married?
Did you bring an invitation?

832
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,312
I wish.

833
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,899
I've been drinking more these days
because my mom keeps nagging at me.

834
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,443
-How's your girlfriend?
-We broke up ages ago.

835
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,655
You broke up again? Gosh, what's with you?

836
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,628
Seon-u.

837
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,963
What's going on?

838
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,757
Did you cause trouble?
Why are you so serious?

839
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,843
Listen carefully. Don't get shocked.

840
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,096
I think…

841
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,807
I saw So-won.

842
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,853
What's so shocking about that?
Where did you see her?

843
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,106
I thought I was mistaken,
so I went back to check.

844
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,858
But I think it was her.

845
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,029
Where did you see her?

846
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,198
At a hostess bar.

847
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,204
She probably went with her friends.

848
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,332
Or maybe with her colleagues.

849
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,666
Don't you get what I mean?

850
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,210
I'm serious for a reason.

851
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,004
What do you mean?

852
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,672
She was there

853
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,134
as a hostess.

854
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,302
Are you crazy?

855
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,555
How could you say something like that?

856
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,016
I couldn't believe it either.
That's why I went back.

857
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,313
Where is it? Lead the way.

858
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,151
What is all that?

859
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,028
-What is that?
-They're heavy.

860
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,489
-Hurry up and take them.
-Okay. Goodness.

861
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,492
-What's this?
-What?

862
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,618
I'm so tired.

863
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,453
-My gosh.
-Goodness, what is this?

864
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:09,415
Do you guys gather together every day
and discuss how to make fun of me?

865
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,875
What is all this?

866
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,294
Joo-hee, did you get your lottery money?

867
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,675
I want you to focus.

868
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,344
Yes, of course. We're focusing.

869
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,805
How much did you get?
Did you get everything?

870
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:27,809
I'm not going to receive the money.

871
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:31,562
I mean, I'm going to think
that I didn't win the lottery.

872
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,606
-What?
-What? Why?

873
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,733
Are you intimidated?

874
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,112
My gosh.
It's not even tens of millions of won.

875
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,364
Give me the ticket.
I'll go with you tomorrow.

876
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,783
-It's gone.
-What's gone?

877
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,494
-The lottery ticket.
-You lost it?

878
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,420
You crazy brat.

879
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,298
Hey. Have you lost it too?
What's wrong with you?

880
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,134
You really shredded it?

881
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,556
Why would you… I don't believe this.

882
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,015
Seven million won is a lot.

883
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,268
Think of your monthly wage.

884
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,936
I know it's big money.

885
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,356
The three of us could've gone on a trip
to Southeast Asia with that money.

886
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,899
Then why did you do that?

887
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:23,030
That was the biggest piece of luck
I had ever gotten

888
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,616
in my entire life.

889
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,161
I decided to give that luck to you.

890
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,914
Live four more years.

891
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,417
That ticket came in fourth place.

892
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,305
Fine.

893
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,601
I'll try.

894
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,691
I'll take that luck from you.

895
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,825
I love our energy today.

896
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,620
You and I are both amazing friends.

897
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,121
Guys, take this out.

898
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,206
What is it?

899
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,087
Okay. Let's all sit down.

900
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,092
What is all this?

901
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,346
Did you buy me a gift
because I won the lottery?

902
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,640
No. Who cares about your lottery?

903
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,768
Hey! I made a noble sacrifice!

904
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,478
I admit you did something amazing.

905
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,982
Chan-young, I want you to decide.

906
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,276
Decide what?

907
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,486
You too, Joo-hee.

908
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,572
Decide what?

909
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,242
I've already made my decision.

910
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,036
You need to decide whether

911
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,041
we're going to have fun
in the time we have together

912
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:59,252
or be serious and sad.

913
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,212
I decided that I'm going to have fun.

914
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,464
It's your turn to choose.

915
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,011
You're already eliminated.

916
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,305
I'm just sad about the lottery ticket.

917
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,604
My gosh, you guys are nuts.

918
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:24,527
But why did you get
these outfits and shoes?

919
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,279
Let's go to a nightclub.

920
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,950
Look at you crying and laughing.

921
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,162
And seriously? A nightclub?
Are you guys crazy?

922
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:38,499
We didn't get to go on Joo-hee's birthday.

923
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,710
I was poorly dressed,
so they didn't let us in.

924
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:44,255
Yes, it was all because of you.
Gosh, that makes me so angry.

925
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,551
What's done is done.

926
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,430
So instead of looking back,

927
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,559
let's just do everything

928
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,812
that we've always wanted to do.

929
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,234
What about the States?

930
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,904
Right. What about your sabbatical?

931
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:10,615
During my sabbatical…

932
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,494
I'll be taking care of Chan-young.

933
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:17,955
So…

934
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,333
we can do anything.

935
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,377
Let's do everything
that you've dreamed of.

936
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,262
Chan-young.

937
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,106
I won't ask you to get treatment.

938
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,612
So just do me one favor.

939
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,081
I want you to be…

940
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:05,211
the happiest terminally ill person…

941
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,506
the world has ever seen.

942
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,721
Okay.

943
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,493
Which one's mine?

944
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,704
This one. This is yours.

945
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,915
-This is Joo-hee's.
-What's mine?

946
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,333
This is yours.

947
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,669
You asked me to be
the happiest terminally ill person.

948
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,337
Is this the most expensive one?

949
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,757
Why would I do that?
You can't even wear it for long.

950
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,927
-I can't believe you just said that.
-Isn't this bag pretty?

951
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,847
Hey, this looks a little big for me.

952
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,807
You've gained weight.

953
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:00,975
-It'll fit.
-Really?

954
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,144
-Yes.
-No, I didn't.

955
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,021
They're a set.

956
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,230
They go together?

957
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:08,357
Yes. It's gorgeous, isn't it?

958
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,507
-Let's go dance.
-Okay.

959
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,509
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

960
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,983
What's she doing? Come.

961
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,236
-What? Come on.
-Come here.

962
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,539
Why isn't she coming?

963
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,916
-Get over here.
-Come on.

964
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,459
Come over here.

965
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:41,158
We began spending the limited time
we had with Chan-young

966
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,786
with laughter and excitement.

967
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,962
-Who is he?
-Does anyone know him?

968
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,713
-Who are you?
-Do you know him?

969
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,173
-No.
-Who is he?

970
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,301
He's good-looking.

971
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,511
So-won.

972
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:02,763
So-won, let's go.

973
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:05,850
Is he your boyfriend?

974
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,146
Get up. Let's go. Come on.

975
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,148
Let's go.

976
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,108
What's going on?

977
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:15,693
Go where?

978
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,445
Let's go home.

979
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,072
I have no home.

980
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:27,705
Get up. Come on.

981
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,039
-Let me go.
-Who are you?

982
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,000
Let go of me! Let go!

983
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:31,917
Come here.

984
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,460
-Let's go.
-What's going on?

985
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:36,422
Why are we leaving already?

986
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,049
My gosh, did you get drunk drinking Coke?

987
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,177
What kind of dance was that?

988
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,305
I might die of embarrassment
before I even die of my illness.

989
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:47,433
Anything's dancing
if you're in the groove.

990
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,392
She's right.

991
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:51,645
That's what you call a funky chicken.
You have two left feet.

992
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,105
That was so embarrassing.

993
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,358
-No one's ever said that to me before.
-My dance was pretty nice.

994
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,277
-I went like this.
-Hey.

995
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,154
You're hopeless, Joo-hee.

996
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,071
Why?

997
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:02,198
That was our choice.

998
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,616
You're my hope.

999
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,076
To live like there's no tomorrow.

1000
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,203
It wasn't too bad.

1001
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,997
-Like there's no sadness.
-I'm totally feeling it.

1002
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,083
That's how we decided to spend each day.

1003
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,128
-Come on.
-Let go of me.

1004
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,546
-Let's go.
-Isn't that Seon-u?

1005
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,924
-Let me go.
-Just come with me.

1006
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,509
-Hey.
-Let go of me.

1007
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,263
No. You're coming with me. Please.

1008
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,556
Jane.

1009
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,266
-Let's go back inside.
-No, wait.

1010
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,310
No, wait. So-won.

1011
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,062
Wait. So-won!

1012
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,457
Just when we had decided to have fun…

1013
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:58,921
he looked…

1014
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,591
very sad.

1015
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,906
Are you unwell?

1016
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,327
I guess IQ has nothing to do with dating.

1017
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,871
She should keep trying aggressively, okay?

1018
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:15,247
Let's get lunch.

1019
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,796
I have some lifelong wishes.

1020
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,797
SAY GOODBYE TO MOM AND DAD
SET JOO-HEE UP WITH THE CHEF

1021
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,257
Mi-jo. Joo-hee.

1022
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,759
I'll find you a boyfriend.

1023
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,720
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.
You did such a good job.

1024
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,141
Just cry.

1025
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:36,643
I'm scared, Mi-jo.

1026
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,812
It's scary.

1027
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:44,360
