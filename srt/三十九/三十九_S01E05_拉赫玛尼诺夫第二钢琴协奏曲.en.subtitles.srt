1
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,512
Hey, you're up.

2
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,598
Can you come and help me?

3
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,225
Mi-hyeon ran away.

4
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,483
Did the music wake you?

5
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,613
This sock…

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,866
I can't find the other sock.

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,203
Really? That always happens.

8
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,331
Strangely, one of the socks
goes missing at times.

9
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,959
Did the washing machine swallow it?

10
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,258
How do you like this music?

11
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,386
It's warm.

12
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,310
You have great sensibility, Mi-jo.

13
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,231
That was a beautiful expression.

14
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,193
What's the title of this music?

15
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,612
This?

16
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,579
It's "Piano Concerto No. 2"
by Rachmaninoff.

17
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,247
Tricky, right?

18
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,961
"Piano Concerto No. 2" by Rachmaninoff.

19
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,048
Here. Come to me.

20
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,181
Goodness. Let's find the other sock.

21
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,434
Here it is.

22
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,940
All right. Let's find this one too.

23
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:16,195
RACHMANINOFF PIANO CONCERTO NO. 2

24
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,408
RACHMANINOFF PIANO CONCERTO NO. 2

25
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,578
-Let go of me.
-Come here.

26
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,663
I'm working! Let me go!

27
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,749
So-won, please.

28
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,876
Why did you come here?

29
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,547
You're too drunk.
Let's go to my place, okay?

30
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,802
I don't know how you found out,

31
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,847
but you shouldn't have come
even if you knew.

32
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,767
It's really over for me,
now that you know.

33
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,187
I have nowhere to go now. I'd rather die!

34
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,104
Why would you die?

35
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,690
Why would you die?

36
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,194
You should've asked me for help,
not work at a place like this!

37
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,363
Why do I have to tell you everything?

38
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,740
We're not family anymore.

39
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,955
Kim So-won.

40
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,582
Do you seriously think…

41
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,044
we're not family?

42
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,589
Didn't we share a mom?

43
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,387
Damn it.

44
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,517
I hate this.

45
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,478
I hate this all!

46
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,564
Jane.

47
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,526
-Let's go back inside.
-No, wait.

48
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,987
No, wait. So-won.

49
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,154
So-won. Wait.

50
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
So-won!

51
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,446
Hey, shouldn't you go check on him?

52
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,576
I don't think now is the right time.

53
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,413
That woman couldn't have been
his girlfriend, could she?

54
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,666
They didn't seem to be lovers.

55
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,211
Let's go. I'm hungry.

56
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,713
Let's grab something to eat.

57
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,913
No, wait. So-won.

58
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,456
Wait. So-won!

59
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,518
Why do I have to tell you everything?

60
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,144
We're not family anymore.

61
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,699
Come in.

62
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,315
You're avoiding eye contact.

63
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,734
No, I'm not.

64
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,322
You look anxious.

65
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,743
No, I don't.

66
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,786
Yes, you do.

67
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,544
I went to a nightclub
with my friends last night.

68
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,214
We decided

69
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,760
to make Chan-young
the happiest terminally ill person,

70
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,388
though we don't know if it'll work.

71
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,560
So that's why you were there.

72
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:58,936
Yes.

73
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,815
I was there…

74
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
for So-won.

75
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,284
So-won?

76
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,412
It turns out

77
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,124
she works there.

78
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,505
Oh…

79
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,262
I wanted to talk with her,
but she turned her phone off.

80
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,600
Then have you tried her place?

81
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,852
No.

82
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,313
I don't know where she lives.

83
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
I guess…

84
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,448
she got stuck in a difficult place.

85
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,163
Don't worry about her.
You already have a lot on your plate.

86
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,916
Come in.

87
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll let patients in now.

88
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,593
I'll be leaving work in the afternoon.

89
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,678
Okay.

90
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,965
I'm hungry.

91
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,068
Gosh.

92
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,575
Is the preparation going well?

93
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,953
No.

94
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,957
There's a lot to do
before you leave, isn't there?

95
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,417
I'm not going.

96
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,545
I can't.

97
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,882
Are you afraid to go
to an unfamiliar place?

98
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,718
That's not why.

99
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,597
My friend is very sick.

100
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,475
If I go…

101
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,188
she may not be here when I come back.

102
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,360
Goodness.

103
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,950
I believe you said you felt the most
at peace when you were with your friends.

104
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,077
Is she one of them?

105
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,079
Yes.

106
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,375
How are your panic attacks?
Have they gotten worse?

107
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,793
Actually…

108
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,672
I think I'm feeling much better.

109
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,966
Maybe it's because

110
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,427
I found something to desperately focus on.

111
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,054
Anything else?

112
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,473
No.

113
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,519
I just want to be able to sleep.

114
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,896
I'll prescribe you some medicine again.

115
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,527
Instead of worrying about the future,

116
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:40,074
think about the good memories
you had with her.

117
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,993
The good memories?

118
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,045
They look exactly like each other!

119
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,797
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

120
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,966
-It's your fault!
-Sorry.

121
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,051
-Stop it!
-Fine.

122
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,636
Okay. What should we eat?

123
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,139
-Tteokbokki?
-Tteokbokki? Okay. It's my treat.

124
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,807
That's the only thing we eat.

125
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,725
You're right. We eat it every day.

126
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,769
-You're right.
-But it's tasty.

127
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,854
I agree.

128
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,732
GOCHEOK

129
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,039
The doors are opening.

130
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,669
Please get on
after passengers have gotten off.

131
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,047
The doors are closing.

132
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,971
Excuse me.

133
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,973
Did you lose something?

134
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,850
I'll just think I helped the needy.

135
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,685
Gosh, what a crazy…

136
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,563
Hey, get lost. Just go.

137
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,305
The doors are opening.

138
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,607
The doors are closing.

139
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,858
What are you doing here?

140
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,860
What about you?

141
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,197
I'm hungry.

142
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,667
You were never the type
to search for tasty restaurants.

143
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,253
I just searched for tofu dishes.

144
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,465
They say protein is good for you.

145
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,549
Eat up.

146
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,558
I have no food at home.

147
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,353
Let's go to Yangpyeong.

148
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,648
You can get food from your parents.

149
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,067
And you should tell them.

150
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,493
It's good.

151
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,372
Have some soft tofu too.

152
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,510
Why did you want to go to the States?

153
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,596
You know…

154
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,058
I told you. I just wanted to rest.

155
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,603
I must be getting in your way.

156
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,356
It's not like that.

157
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,607
Don't lie.

158
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,733
It's not.

159
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,449
Don't go.

160
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,328
I don't want you to go.

161
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,957
What will I do without you?

162
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:44,920
Don't go, okay?

163
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,340
I won't.

164
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,094
I'm going to stay by your side.

165
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm scared, Mi-jo.

166
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,621
It's scary.

167
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,795
Me too.

168
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,728
Hey.

169
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,855
Do you know what's funny?

170
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,066
Knowing that I'll die soon…

171
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,196
made me think about those around me.

172
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,202
When I think of my parents…

173
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,455
I'm sad…

174
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,374
because I'm sorry and worried.

175
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,087
When I think of Jin-seok,

176
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,924
I'm sad because of what could've been
and because I'm sorry.

177
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,676
When I think of Joo-hee…

178
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,473
I'm sad because I worry
and feel sorry for her.

179
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,309
What about me?

180
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,397
That's the funny part.

181
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,191
When I think of you…

182
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,822
I'm sad because I already miss you.

183
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,129
So is that why…

184
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,882
you were at the subway station?

185
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,637
What about you?

186
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,976
My doctor told me to think about

187
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,062
only the good memories we had.

188
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,150
And that place came to my mind.

189
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,196
Where we met for the first time.

190
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,203
You must freaking love me.

191
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,212
Oh, please.

192
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:38,302
To my friend whom I freaking love,
eat lots of tofu.

193
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,887
You better finish this.

194
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,181
It wasn't easy to find this restaurant.

195
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,265
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,277
Live as if this isn't happening.

197
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,072
As if it's not happening?

198
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,574
Yes.

199
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,661
As if it's not happening…

200
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,496
For example,

201
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,500
don't stop yourself
from seeing Seon-u because of me.

202
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,503
I know how careful you are.

203
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,298
Judging by how quickly you slept with him,

204
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,634
he must be really special.

205
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,302
Let's talk about something else.

206
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,346
There you go again.

207
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,849
You keep straying because of me.

208
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,352
Don't worry about it.

209
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,730
You broke up with Seong-cheol

210
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,107
because you kept saying no
to a trip together.

211
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,111
That was because I wasn't sure about him.

212
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,698
So you're obviously sure
about Seon-u, you idiot.

213
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,659
What should I do then?

214
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,495
Follow your heart.

215
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,455
That's what I'm doing.

216
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,207
No, you're not.

217
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,293
I stopped you from taking a sabbatical.

218
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,005
You finally met a guy you like,
yet you're hesitant because of me.

219
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,716
Then I'll become
even more ill because I feel bad.

220
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,512
Keep acting like this,

221
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,931
and I won't be
the happiest terminally ill person.

222
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,520
Rather, I'll be a terminally ill person
who feels the most terrible.

223
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,941
That's a frightening way
to threaten someone.

224
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,195
Just know that the state
of my condition depends on you.

225
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:29,288
I'll show you how passionate
dating at the age of 39 can be,

226
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,831
so don't feel hurt.

227
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,961
If you're all talk,
I'm going to flick you on the forehead.

228
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,879
Gosh, you're terrible.

229
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,548
You're so annoying.

230
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,813
You must be cleaning up for the day.

231
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,356
-Hello.
-Hi.

232
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,733
Are you here to eat?

233
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,028
No, I was just passing by.

234
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,573
This is for you.

235
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,661
It's not free though, is it?

236
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,830
There must be something.

237
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,126
Actually, I was wondering

238
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,338
if I could borrow
your kitchen after closing time.

239
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,799
Well, may I ask why?

240
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,011
I want to cook something for Chan-young,

241
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,263
but I can't really do it at home.

242
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,558
I see. Of course, you can.

243
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,477
What will you cook?

244
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,730
Well, it's something I made
for my mom when she was sick.

245
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,816
She also battled cancer in the past.

246
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,194
She had such a hard time
eating it back then.

247
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,905
So I'm afraid she might
become nauseous if I make it at home.

248
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,032
I see.

249
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,868
Then let me help you.

250
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,662
No, that's okay.
It takes a long time to make the dish.

251
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,414
But I'm curious about what it is.

252
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,500
When will you make it?

253
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,633
Don't tell me you'll come here every day.

254
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,259
What about work?

255
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,721
The director and I
decided to split the work

256
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,681
so I could spend more time with you.

257
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,393
I don't have that much time, you know?

258
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,647
I have many things to do
and many people to see.

259
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,773
Have some alone time.

260
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,402
I told Ju-won.

261
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,198
About the divorce.

262
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,496
Why are you rushing things
all of a sudden?

263
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,499
That young boy must be so hurt.

264
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,126
Come on.

265
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,422
Why did you have to do that
when I already have a lot on my mind?

266
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,924
I'm in a rush.

267
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,468
Why? Because I'm dying soon?

268
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,011
You're not dying soon.

269
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,763
Eat good food

270
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,890
and move to a rural area.
I'll go with you.

271
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,018
What about your work?

272
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,147
I already told you that
the director would be helping me out.

273
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,524
And the company runs fine without me.

274
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,527
Please don't do this.
You're stressing me out even more.

275
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,322
Chan-young, can you please reconsider it?

276
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,449
Why are you refusing treatment?

277
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,411
Jin-seok.

278
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,872
It's not treatment.

279
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,625
Treatment should help you get better.

280
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,710
But in my case,

281
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,546
I'll just be living a bit longer.

282
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,387
I have a lot on my mind
and a lot of things to do.

283
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,933
Receiving medical treatment
should be your top priority, Chan-young.

284
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,644
I don't know

285
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,439
how to tell my parents.

286
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,484
And I need to take care
of some things for Mi-jo and Joo-hee.

287
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,906
What? What's there to take care of
for them in this situation?

288
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,784
I won't talk to you
if you keep raising your voice.

289
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,954
Okay. Is it better if I whisper?

290
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,124
You're too nosy, Chan-young.

291
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,918
-Happy?
-Stop it.

292
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,795
Come on.

293
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,010
I'm looking for a place to stay.

294
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,679
A rural area
with fresh air is best, right?

295
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,181
What do you mean?

296
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,476
Live with me
if you're not going to be hospitalized.

297
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,688
You've gone insane. You truly have.

298
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,609
Jin-seok, don't be rash like this.

299
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,403
Who's going to stay by your side longer?

300
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,073
Ju-won's mother is.

301
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,283
Follow your heart,

302
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,786
and I'll follow mine. Like this.

303
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,789
This is so nice. I can do whatever I want.

304
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,874
Let me go.

305
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,252
Come on. It's locked now.

306
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,271
Hello, Father.

307
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,438
Are you home?

308
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,692
No, I'm outside. I'm doing something.

309
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,318
You'll be late then.

310
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm in Seoul.

311
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,488
I flew in today.

312
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,616
Is something wrong?

313
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,493
I came because I could never reach you.

314
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,122
I'll call you tomorrow.

315
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,124
Yes.

316
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,750
Okay.

317
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,603
He's Jane's older brother.

318
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,688
Her older brother?

319
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,732
I'll go in first.

320
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,234
Thank you for seeing me.

321
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,155
Jane never told me
she had an older brother.

322
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,743
That's not her name.
Her name is So-won. Kim So-won.

323
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,494
I know.

324
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,705
Are you her real brother?

325
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,417
Can you tell me her home address?

326
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,420
Shouldn't her brother know that?

327
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,631
It's a long story. Please help me.

328
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,041
I left something at your door
since I thought you'd be sleeping.

329
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,919
Please let me know if you're okay.

330
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,752
Come in.

331
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,088
Let's get lunch.

332
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,175
Don't say you're not hungry
or that you're full.

333
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,764
All right. I guess I should eat.

334
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,018
Just a second.

335
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,315
So-won.

336
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,233
Let's eat, Seon-u.

337
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,449
Hey, this is great.

338
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,993
I was worried there wouldn't be
enough braised chicken for everyone.

339
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,870
Go enjoy your lunch.

340
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,298
OFFICE PANTRY

341
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,844
This looks tasty.

342
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,351
-Who is she?
-It's going to get cold. Dig in, guys.

343
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,520
I knew it.

344
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,772
How could someone so handsome be single?

345
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,148
She's too pretty.

346
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,692
No one can be prettier than her.

347
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,985
-I can!
-I can!

348
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,196
Oh, please.

349
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,658
She's his younger sister. Happy?

350
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,993
-I see. Thank you for the food.
-I see.

351
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,662
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

352
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,831
-Eat up.
-I feel better now.

353
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,461
I was so worried.

354
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,964
If she was his girlfriend,
you'd be no match for her.

355
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,465
What are you talking about?

356
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,843
So many guys hit on me
at a nightclub recently.

357
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,135
You went to a nightclub?

358
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,554
Hey.

359
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,306
You should've invited me
if you were dancing.

360
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,724
Just eat.

361
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,894
This is really good.

362
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,410
You're going to have an upset stomach.
Drink some water.

363
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,498
I always crave spicy food
when I'm stressed.

364
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,084
Mom did too.

365
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,635
It's true that you and I

366
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,554
shared a mom.

367
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,640
That's why I came here.

368
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,851
It gave me the courage to.

369
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,478
I'm glad you came.

370
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,273
It wasn't like this
when I first came back.

371
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,316
So-won.

372
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,444
I have many questions.

373
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,865
I can't sleep because I'm curious
and heartbroken. But you know what?

374
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,658
I'm not going to ask.

375
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,162
Because I know
it won't be easy for you to answer.

376
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,956
But let's live together.

377
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,460
-Just rest. Don't work.
-I have a lot of money.

378
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,255
I had nothing to spend money on.

379
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,216
So you don't need
to support me financially.

380
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,260
But…

381
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,012
I have a favor to ask.

382
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,307
Don't tell me to play the piano again.

383
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,560
This thought came to my mind.

384
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:22,815
What kind of person would I have become
had I stayed at the orphanage?

385
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,528
Luckily, I was adopted by rich parents,
so I was able to play the piano.

386
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,700
Had I not been adopted,
I would've struggled to make ends meet.

387
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,914
Why would you say that?

388
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,125
Girls your age don't say such things.

389
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,210
Do you think so?

390
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,504
Maybe it was from a movie.

391
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,797
Or a TV show.

392
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,632
Don't ever say things like that again.

393
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,345
You can play the piano again later--

394
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,263
Then I'll run away again.

395
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,186
Tell me to play the piano,
and you'll never see me ever again.

396
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,194
Let's eat.

397
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,738
Eat slowly.

398
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,075
I quit that job.

399
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,791
Thank you.

400
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,214
I'm sorry, Seon-u.

401
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:32,969
Eat up.

402
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,229
-Here.
-Why are you feeding me olives?

403
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,232
It's not pitted.

404
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,112
Why are you giving me olives
when there's no wine?

405
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,782
Spit the seed out.

406
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,662
Isn't this the same thing?

407
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,539
This is really good for you.

408
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,792
Have a spoonful every day.

409
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,921
I'll cook you
something really delicious next time.

410
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,173
Look forward to it.

411
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,257
That's okay.

412
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,885
-Don't cook.
-Be quiet.

413
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,432
Hey, please don't tell me
you'll be coming over every single day.

414
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,225
Do you want to move?

415
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,811
You said my neighborhood
was upscale and nice.

416
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,024
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life there, thinking I'm dirt-poor.

417
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,442
Then come to my neighborhood.

418
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,570
-That's not a bad idea.
-Right?

419
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,239
-Your mom could cook tasty food for me.
-Of course.

420
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,617
How about we just buy a house
and move in together?

421
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,534
Should we?

422
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,578
Why does everyone want to live with me?

423
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,580
Your love for me is overflowing.

424
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,873
Who else said that?

425
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,250
I don't know.

426
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,502
So?

427
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,338
Where's that crazy program
for the terminally ill?

428
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,676
If that list is just filled
with your personal wishes,

429
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,428
then I don't want to see it.

430
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,310
I knew it.
She's always so predictable, right?

431
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,478
Let's go on a trip.

432
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,105
What? That's boring.

433
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,607
I have a few creative ones.

434
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,985
-I searched online--
-Hey, you guys can just go home.

435
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,656
Come on. Can you please
appreciate her hard work?

436
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,949
She jotted down so many.

437
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,326
Let's just hear them.

438
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,702
Fine. Tell me.

439
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,539
All right. Number one.

440
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,706
"Take wedding photos."

441
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,999
-Forget it.
-Forget it.

442
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,253
How about this one?

443
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,630
"Going on a memorable trip
with our parents."

444
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,923
-Hey.
-Come on.

445
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,134
Isn't that quite original?

446
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,469
No, it's not.

447
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,887
I mean…

448
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,849
I knew this would happen,
so I came up with my own.

449
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,934
What are they?

450
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,395
You see,

451
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,522
I have some lifelong wishes.

452
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,940
-Tell us.
-Tell us.

453
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,651
-Joo-hee.
-Yes?

454
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,111
I'll find you a boyfriend.

455
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,404
What?

456
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,947
Mi-jo.

457
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,574
-Hey--
-Let's find your real mom.

458
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,126
Hey, that has nothing to do with you.

459
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,713
Why would you waste your time
on those things?

460
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,339
Let's go with the wedding photos.

461
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,633
-Let's do that.
-Yes. Let's just go on that trip.

462
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,927
-That's much better.
-They're my wishes.

463
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,600
I mean it. I'm serious.

464
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,940
-Hey--
-They're my wishes.

465
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,954
If you'd picked up my calls,
I wouldn't have flown all the way here

466
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,916
from the other side of the world.

467
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,962
Why did you give up
that good job of yours and come here?

468
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,382
What about work? Do you have a job?

469
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,425
I do.

470
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,510
I like it better here.

471
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,809
Don't tell me you came here
to find So-won.

472
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,233
Shouldn't you ask how she's doing first?

473
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,443
Why are you so obsessed with her?

474
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:22,281
It's the same reason as to
why you flew all the way here to see me.

475
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,824
She's not like us.

476
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,451
-She's family.
-Family?

477
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,536
She refused to be our family ages ago.

478
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,207
She's not even related to us by blood,
so how could she be family?

479
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,960
Father.

480
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,837
Do you think

481
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,132
she wouldn't have noticed
how you truly felt about her?

482
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,676
I provided enough for her.

483
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,179
She received more support
than she deserved.

484
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,931
What if we didn't adopt her?

485
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,892
Would she have played
the piano or gone to Juilliard?

486
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,479
She would've struggled to make ends meet.

487
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,107
What kind of person would I have become

488
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,608
had I stayed at the orphanage?

489
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:04,115
Luckily, I was adopted by rich parents,
so I was able to play the piano.

490
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,662
Had I not been adopted,
I would've struggled to make ends meet.

491
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,374
Father.

492
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:19,130
Did you say the same thing to her?

493
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,216
-What does that matter?
-Did you?

494
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,554
I only said the truth.

495
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,641
-How could you say such a thing to--
-Lower your voice!

496
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,143
How dare you?

497
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,238
You should go back.

498
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,908
Kim Seon-u!

499
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,877
What are you doing?

500
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,799
I'll be staying at a hotel for now.

501
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,052
How could you do this?

502
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,722
Why didn't you tell me sooner
when you knew it all along?

503
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,810
You must've despised me for so long.

504
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,648
It's not easy to despise someone.

505
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,693
I just didn't have
the courage to let everything out.

506
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,864
Aren't you better than this?

507
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:31,077
Now that you want a divorce,
you threaten me with it.

508
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,828
Are you this low?

509
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,165
Ju-won will come home soon.
We'll talk again next time.

510
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,710
Why do you care about him
when he's not even your son?

511
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,588
Because you don't.

512
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,023
Dad, where are you going?

513
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,608
I need to go on a business trip.

514
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,319
When will you return?

515
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,946
Soon. Go wash your hands.

516
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,200
Okay.

517
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,827
Ju-won.

518
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,417
I'll be calling you,
so keep your phone close. Okay?

519
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,294
Okay.

520
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,297
Go wash your hands.

521
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,215
Okay.

522
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,115
Chan-young.

523
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,784
I'll be staying
at a hotel near your place,

524
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,578
so call me right away if you need me.

525
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,069
MOM'S BIRTHDAY

526
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,702
Just until Christmas.

527
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,789
Until then…

528
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,730
SAY GOODBYE TO MOM AND DAD
SET JOO-HEE UP WITH THE CHEF

529
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,317
FIND MI-JO'S BIOLOGICAL MOM
MAKE JIN-SEOK RECONCILE WITH HIS WIFE

530
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,460
I wonder what delicious dish
Joo-hee made for us.

531
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,796
I can guarantee

532
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,673
that it'll be bad.

533
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,385
You're right.
It's hard to appreciate her dishes.

534
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,388
Hey, have you thought about it?

535
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,599
-About what?
-How to set her up with that chef.

536
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,477
Oh, that? Of course.

537
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:48,148
I really thought long and hard about it.

538
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,692
But you know what?

539
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,404
I have no idea. I'm drawing a blank.

540
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,410
I guess IQ has nothing to do with dating.

541
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,037
But it's too difficult.

542
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,456
He has a girlfriend and Joo-hee is older.

543
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,125
It's not easy.

544
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,128
She should keep trying aggressively, okay?

545
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,631
Geez. I was a fool
to expect anything from you.

546
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,008
Why are you scolding me?

547
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,384
Just drive.

548
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,224
Are you going to…

549
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,561
tell your parents today?

550
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,445
I don't even know how to accept this yet,

551
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,573
so how can I tell them?

552
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,210
DERMATOLOGIST KIM SEON-U

553
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,128
Come in.

554
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,922
That's all for the morning.

555
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,049
Okay.

556
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,091
Let's eat.

557
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,345
I'll pass. I'm not feeling too well.

558
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,388
You're right. You don't look too good.

559
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,433
I couldn't sleep well.
I think a short nap will do the trick.

560
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,018
Rest up.

561
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,519
Enjoy your meal.

562
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,908
What kind of person would I have become
had I stayed at the orphanage?

563
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,873
Had I not been adopted,
I would've struggled to make ends meet.

564
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,958
What if we didn't adopt her?

565
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,503
Would she have played
the piano or gone to Juilliard?

566
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,423
She would've struggled to make ends meet.

567
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:44,473
JEONG'S KITCHEN

568
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,241
You guys shouldn't go on diets.

569
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,368
You need to eat well to be healthy.

570
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,955
I don't go on diets.

571
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,165
We're always eager to eat.

572
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,333
Good.

573
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,001
Have some bulgogi.

574
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,086
Please sit down.

575
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,380
Gosh, my legs.

576
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,092
Mom, you should hire more people.

577
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,679
You looked so busy back there.
You need more than two.

578
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,098
We're not busy all the time.

579
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,808
By the way, what's the occasion?

580
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,184
We've been seeing you often.

581
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:34,356
It's Mi-jo's day off today. We thought
of going elsewhere but came here instead.

582
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,316
We didn't have anywhere else to go.

583
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,486
Wait. I'll get some braised pollack.

584
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,697
-Sure.
-It's okay. This is already a lot.

585
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,073
Okay.

586
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,037
By the way,
why have you lost so much weight?

587
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,831
Have you seen a doctor?

588
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,421
It's because I have
too many private lessons.

589
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,465
Then cut down on them.

590
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,674
Don't overwork yourself.

591
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,177
Fine. I'll cut down.

592
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,558
By the way…

593
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,936
Yes?

594
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,775
You guys get
medical checkups regularly, right?

595
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,945
Goodness. We get them yearly.

596
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,199
Honey, let's switch hospitals.
That place is too expensive.

597
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,283
They're all the same.

598
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,286
Come to Seoul.
I'll take you to a hospital I know.

599
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,537
That'd be great.

600
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,624
Hey, you should take her there instead.

601
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,751
I bet you're too lazy to get checkups.

602
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,505
I got a checkup too.

603
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,049
Don't worry.

604
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,091
When?

605
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,968
We got them

606
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,137
with Joo-hee.

607
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,639
Well done.

608
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,016
It's wonderful to have a doctor friend.

609
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,061
So? Did they say you're healthy?

610
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,608
Well…

611
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,277
I have a bit of inflammation.

612
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,113
I was told to exercise.

613
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,449
See? I knew it.

614
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,701
You should stop eating spicy food.

615
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,828
Don't let her have this.

616
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,038
That's not the problem.

617
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,541
You should stop drinking.

618
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,708
You too, Mi-jo.

619
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,795
I know. I plan to quit drinking.

620
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,421
Take them all away.

621
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,227
-Mom.
-Yes?

622
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,312
Hire more people, okay?

623
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,148
You'll get sick
if you keep overworking yourself.

624
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,485
-Hey, I have better stamina than your dad.
-What?

625
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,320
I became stronger with age.

626
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,863
Goodness.

627
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,282
Right. Hold on.

628
00:47:56,873 --> 00:48:00,335
I got one for each of you,

629
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,962
so take them every day.

630
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,590
-What?
-We already have enough supplements.

631
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,800
These are much better.

632
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,886
Don't just store them.
That'll be pointless.

633
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,847
Gosh. You should take them instead.

634
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,266
Bye.

635
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,977
Drive carefully, Mi-jo.

636
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,312
I will. We'll visit again.

637
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,896
-Sure. Visit often.
-Okay.

638
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,065
Bye, ma'am.

639
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,027
Bye.

640
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,362
-Bye.
-Go inside.

641
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,822
-Go.
-Come on. Get in.

642
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,533
-Get in.
-Get in.

643
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,293
Dad, let me hug you.

644
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,461
What's gotten into you?

645
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,512
-Mom.
-Goodness.

646
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,141
Go.

647
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,269
Bye.

648
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,229
Goodbye.

649
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,648
Goodbye. Be careful.

650
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,214
Something's up with her.

651
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,592
What?

652
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,690
Can we pull over for a minute?

653
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,833
Just cry.

654
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,550
They should've had…

655
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,470
another child.

656
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,228
After I die…

657
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,525
who will take care of their funerals?

658
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,947
There's me…

659
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,075
and Joo-hee.

660
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,163
Who will hold
memorial ceremonies for them?

661
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,873
Damn it.

662
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,008
I'll do it.

663
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,554
Really?

664
00:50:58,972 --> 00:50:59,848
Will you do that?

665
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,519
Yes.

666
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,148
I will.

667
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,418
After seeing them…

668
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,129
Damn it. It finally hit me.

669
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,012
What should we do?

670
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,520
I don't know, Chan-young.

671
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,094
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

672
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,762
MEDICAL CHARTS

673
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,889
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO
DERMATOLOGIST

674
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,521
Hey, Mi-hyeon.

675
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,359
Yes, I'm at the clinic.

676
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,320
I'm looking at today's medical charts.

677
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,573
Yes.

678
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,577
Dr. Kim did? Why?

679
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,705
I'm not sure. I think he's sick.

680
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,207
Is it bad?

681
00:52:56,089 --> 00:53:00,093
FATHER

682
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,437
FATHER

683
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,923
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

684
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,715
You said this was a space for me,

685
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,884
but you didn't pick up my calls.

686
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,470
I…

687
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,932
My phone was on mute, so…

688
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,352
Are you unwell?

689
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,354
Just a slight headache.

690
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,316
You had lunch with your sister,

691
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,402
so I thought everything was fine.

692
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,861
Why do you have a headache?

693
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,530
Well…

694
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,866
I realized

695
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:52,789
that I wasn't a reliable brother to her.

696
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,585
What about you?

697
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,462
Did you trust and feel comfortable

698
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,382
with your parents and sister
from the very beginning?

699
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,759
No.

700
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,263
I was…

701
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:13,184
adopted and sent back
to the orphanage twice.

702
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,855
They said I was too quiet

703
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,773
and cold.

704
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,110
I still remember it.

705
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,195
I barely talked at all.

706
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,367
When I first moved in
with my current family,

707
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,288
I didn't talk for over a month, I think.

708
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,040
Why not?

709
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,459
I was anxious.

710
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:44,132
Do you know why I only like
"Piano Concerto No. 2" by Rachmaninoff?

711
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,802
One day,

712
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,140
I woke up from a nap.

713
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,728
My mom was folding laundry
in the living room,

714
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:00,690
and music filled the room.

715
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:05,320
Then she asked me
to help her with the laundry.

716
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,615
While folding the laundry with her,

717
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,284
I finally started to talk.

718
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,245
I chatted away.

719
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:15,789
"I see."

720
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,460
"This is a place where I can be safe

721
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,631
and consider my home."

722
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,384
That was the first time…

723
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,222
I felt comfortable.

724
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,183
So that's why you like Rachmaninoff.

725
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:37,977
Yes.

726
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:46,778
The thought that you weren't a reliable
brother to her came from you, didn't it?

727
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,697
I doubt she feels that way.

728
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,951
I'm not sure.

729
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,165
I met my father yesterday.

730
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,876
He flew in from the States?

731
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,794
Yes.

732
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,213
I came here to find So-won,

733
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,841
and he came here to find me.

734
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:14,389
Then I found out
that he had hurt her deeply.

735
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,144
It's driving me crazy.

736
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,979
I have no idea.

737
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,982
I don't know what I should do.

738
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,069
How could you have no idea?

739
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:33,241
You should protect her by her side
so that he won't hurt her anymore.

740
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,369
Right.

741
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,122
That's the right answer.

742
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,337
So…

743
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,133
stay strong, okay?

744
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,813
Look.

745
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,150
When we meet So-won next time…

746
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,697
can I introduce you to her again?

747
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,367
As my girlfriend?

748
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,918
Can I?

749
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,069
We'll let this boil for now.

750
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,490
I'll lower the heat

751
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,868
and let it boil
for about two and a half hours.

752
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,666
Gosh. This requires
a lot of patience and effort.

753
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,585
Could that be why it's healthy?

754
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:12,423
You three have a great friendship indeed.

755
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,762
We met as teenagers,

756
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,973
spent our twenties together,

757
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,059
and now, we're nearing
the end of our thirties.

758
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,271
I guess you could say that.

759
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,316
I'm the closest

760
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,320
with those I served
in the military with. Why is that?

761
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,281
Did you play soccer with them?

762
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,450
Correct. How did you know?
Did you serve in the military as well?

763
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,785
Come on.

764
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,128
Have you not talked
to your girlfriend since then?

765
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,842
Well…

766
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,177
I felt hesitant about texting her first,

767
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,846
and Hye-jin didn't text me either.

768
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,015
It's frustrating.

769
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:07,020
I still think you should text her first.

770
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,773
I think she hasn't texted you
because she feels so sorry.

771
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,527
I bet she knows that you were hurt
at her birthday party.

772
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,908
Then she should text me first,
not ghost me like this.

773
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,244
You can't when you feel too sorry.

774
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,626
Text her first.

775
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,878
Act like nothing happened.

776
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:49,687
I did it.

777
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,106
What if she ignores my text?

778
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,404
It's her.

779
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,285
Hey, Hye-jin.

780
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,830
I'm at the restaurant.

781
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,332
What about you?

782
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,170
Really? That must be fun.

783
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,557
Those are the good times.

784
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,907
Should we eat with your sister?

785
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,244
Well…

786
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,748
You're obviously so worried about her.

787
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,625
She wouldn't be happy to see this.

788
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,335
Let's meet up together.

789
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,588
I may not be a comedienne,
but I'll try to make it fun for her.

790
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,174
Would it really be okay?

791
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,011
Tell her to come to the clinic
when she's free.

792
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,471
Treat us to something good.

793
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,308
Thank you.

794
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,534
I need your help.

795
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:29,912
Of course, I'm a pretty charming guy.
You know that.

796
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,291
But now that I'm nearing 40,
I've lost my touch

797
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,126
when it comes to dating.

798
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,919
It's the director from before, right?

799
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,131
Yes. She's really eccentric.

800
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,804
I don't know how to
move on from first base with her.

801
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,473
So-won, will you help me?

802
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,060
You're the best.
Can you come in the evening?

803
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,022
Okay. Come by around the time we close.

804
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,732
Bye.

805
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,486
My gosh.

806
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,114
What…

807
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,117
"Really eccentric"?

808
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,661
-Talking about me?
-You heard?

809
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,249
Isn't that what people call
those who are crazy?

810
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,251
Not at all.

811
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:20,963
That's not what I meant.
I was just trying to make her come.

812
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:25,176
Anyway, this eccentric nut
will step out now.

813
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,555
And I'm pretty sure you know
how to move on from first base.

814
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,813
She startled me.

815
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,274
I made this in Chinatown's kitchen.

816
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,319
It took me well over three hours.

817
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,612
With Hyeon-jun?

818
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:45,863
Yes.

819
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:50,660
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.
You did such a good job.

820
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,412
What did you guys
talk about for three hours?

821
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,456
I bet you're much closer now.

822
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,793
I think we did become quite closer.

823
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:02,713
This is nice. It's beautiful.

824
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,549
I gave him some advice

825
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,593
because it seemed like
he was going to break up.

826
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,264
So I told him about women's point of view

827
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,808
and persuaded him
to reach out to her first.

828
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,726
I counseled him a bit.

829
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,644
And then?

830
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,063
I think they're good now.

831
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,147
Hey!

832
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,693
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Why did you yell at me?

833
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:27,196
During all those hours
you spent making that…

834
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,698
Gosh. My head…

835
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,659
Why would you mend
their broken relationship?

836
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,662
They hadn't broken up.
They just almost did.

837
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:36,789
What are you, Mother Teresa? Gandhi?

838
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,292
Why did you have to be so nosy
and help them?

839
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,003
He was worried sick.

840
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,422
-Unbelievable.
-You're just being nosy.

841
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,007
Fine. I'm nosy.

842
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:50,595
Now, try some of this Hippocrates soup
that this nosy woman made.

843
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,929
Okay. Let's eat for now.

844
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,390
-She did put a lot of effort into this.
-Eat.

845
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,226
This would've been invigorating
had they flirted.

846
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,769
-What can we do?
-I'm sorry.

847
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,104
Try some first.

848
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,188
Here.

849
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,151
Isn't it amazing?

850
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,737
Don't you already feel healthier?

851
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,156
Hold on.

852
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,824
What's this taste?

853
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,785
The name of the soup itself
already sounds healthy.

854
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:18,122
-Here you go.
-That's right. Have some of this too.

855
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:22,710
Gosh. I think this is the first time
you've told me about someone you like.

856
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,463
Isn't she gorgeous?

857
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:28,090
Come on. This is unlike you.

858
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,008
What do you mean?

859
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,260
-Hey. I'm sorry I took so long.
-She's here.

860
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,845
You must be hungry.

861
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,805
It's okay. I didn't wait that long.

862
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,806
What should we have?

863
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,935
I used up all my energy, so I'm famished.

864
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,061
Where did you go?

865
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,480
You see, I have an eccentric friend.

866
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:46,233
I feel drained
whenever I hang out with her.

867
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,694
Compared to her, I'm pretty much normal.

868
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,531
You're still bitter about that?

869
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,492
Yes.

870
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,246
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

871
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:07,505
Why is she here with you, Seon-u?

872
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,091
What brings you here?

873
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,301
Why are you here?

874
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,436
Perhaps the way she looked

875
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:27,733
reminded me of how I looked
at the orphanage.

876
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:53,968
I was anxious every day
with no one to lean on.

877
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,720
She reminded me…

878
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,849
of the little girl I used to be.

879
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,980
I didn't know how…

880
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:12,987
but I wanted to become her Rachmaninoff.

881
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,029
I'm sorry.

882
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,531
Back when you used to run a snack bar

883
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,742
did anyone mention anything
about an orphanage?

884
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,454
We decided she would be the happiest
terminally ill person in the world.

885
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,790
But I'm not sure what to do.

886
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,041
Don't tell me you're moving in.

887
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,376
Taking turns to visit every day
is practically living here.

888
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,257
Seon-u did all that
so you wouldn't feel depressed.

889
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,804
-Thank you.
-My heart just skipped a beat.

890
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,263
You're awesome.

891
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,224
You looked so good together.

892
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:26,102
Please leave.

893
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:31,357
