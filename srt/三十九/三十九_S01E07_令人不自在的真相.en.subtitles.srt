1
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,551
You should've taken some eye drops.

2
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,888
How could she bring them to her audition?

3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,016
You should've thought of something sad.

4
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,934
I did.

5
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:00,977
Like what?

6
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,938
Dying young.

7
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,107
You little…

8
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,403
You can always audition again.
Have some soju and forget about it.

9
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,073
This is so frustrating.

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,202
You should've cried like that
at the audition.

11
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,870
How many times must I tell you?

12
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,581
The director had a hilarious face.

13
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,835
This is exactly
why you can't do method acting.

14
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,423
So what if he looks hilarious?
He's still just a human being.

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,426
How will you ever make it
if you're like this? Tell me.

16
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,808
What is that? His face?

17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,578
Damn it. Let's go out.

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,330
Let's have soju.

19
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,581
Yes. Good thinking.

20
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,375
Is the dried pollack place open?

21
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,668
We're leaving.

22
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,128
Okay. Good thinking.

23
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,295
All right.

24
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,380
-Gosh.
-What?

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,507
Someone's here.

26
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,842
Can I help you?

27
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,970
Are you Joo-hee?
I can barely recognize you.

28
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,721
Right.

29
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,764
Is someone here?

30
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,267
Yes. You have a guest.

31
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,900
-Go on, then. Don't drink too much.
-Okay.

32
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,652
-Okay.
-Bye. Go on.

33
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,736
Goodbye.

34
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,413
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,789
I just thought

36
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,458
I'd stop by since I was nearby.

37
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,210
Joo-hee is beautiful.

38
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,337
Girls her age are so pretty, aren't they?

39
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,214
I'm going out. Let's go.

40
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,425
Ji-min must be around her age.

41
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,511
I bet she's pretty just like me.

42
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,930
I must be getting old.

43
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,933
I miss her from time to time.

44
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,062
You said you didn't deserve to be her mom.

45
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,939
You abandoned her as an infant.

46
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,901
Don't be like that.
It's been a while since we last met.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,071
I almost lost my diner because of someone.

48
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,533
And thanks to that,
I'm fighting cancer now.

49
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,703
But I'll put it all behind me,
so don't ever come to see me.

50
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,913
Get up.

51
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,372
-Mom.
-Yes?

52
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,457
I left my wallet here.

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,168
-I see.
-There it is.

54
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,169
Here.

55
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,296
-See you.
-Okay, see you.

56
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:45,767
THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH

57
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,602
-No. Here, ma'am.
-What?

58
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,355
Thank you. Have one too.

59
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,481
Do you like pears?

60
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,691
-I can't get enough of it.
-Good.

61
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,695
By the way, why isn't Mi-jo picking up?

62
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,448
Are they fighting
because they couldn't go camping?

63
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,159
I doubt it.
They're probably just chatting.

64
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,789
-Is it sweet?
-Yes.

65
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,875
When did you buy this?
It's really sweet and ripe.

66
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,252
-It's really good.
-Goodness.

67
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,629
EPISODE 7

68
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,447
Hey.

69
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,759
Where did you get these?

70
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,344
Oh, those shoes?

71
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,432
A friend of mine works at that hospital.
I took them from him.

72
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,683
I look like an old man.

73
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,020
I'll buy you new shoes tomorrow.

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,029
By the way, where are we going?
Are you not dropping me home?

75
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,615
We had plans, remember?

76
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,090
What should I do? Let me help.

77
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,010
It's okay. You helped me put up the tent.

78
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,554
Just eat and relax.
Don't do anything else.

79
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,391
All right.

80
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,394
Thank you.

81
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,365
Here.

82
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,619
Have some first. I'll eat in a bit.

83
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,288
It's perfectly juicy right now.
Just eat it.

84
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,878
-How is it?
-It's good.

85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,265
You have panic disorder, right?

86
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,230
Every now and then. It's not that serious.

87
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,192
Is that why you wanted
to take a sabbatical?

88
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,862
No. That wasn't the sole reason.

89
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,871
Why aren't you eating? Eat up.

90
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,508
Who's the woman you were with back there?

91
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,181
She's Jin-seok's wife.

92
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,026
Let's just say goodbye here.
You don't need to see me out.

93
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,487
I enjoy driving, so let me drive you home.

94
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,531
Gosh, I'll feel uncomfortable.

95
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,075
You reminded me of Chan-young just now.

96
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,370
You take after me in the worst ways.

97
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,957
Come to Yangpyeong sometime.
I'll cook you something nice.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,917
Yes, ma'am. I will do that.

99
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,670
Can you drop me off at the bus stop?

100
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,380
Sure. Let's go.

101
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,298
-Bye.
-But I can--

102
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,591
-Gosh, don't see us out.
-Okay.

103
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,967
-Bye.
-Let's go.

104
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,135
-Drive safely.
-Bye.

105
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,595
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

106
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,096
-Bye.
-Drive safely, ma'am.

107
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,065
You have a wonderful mother.

108
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,942
You really do.

109
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,157
Are you okay?

110
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,994
I'm fine.
I just need to sit down for a minute.

111
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,126
SEON-JU

112
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,838
You're getting a call.

113
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,466
I know. I need to sit down and rest too.

114
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,346
That was so hectic.

115
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,847
I know.

116
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,893
You don't think
she caught on to it, do you?

117
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,312
When will you tell her?

118
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,944
I'm not sure.

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,712
Can you call Seon-u
and ask if he knows where Mi-jo is?

120
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,130
Sure, I will.

121
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,057
Hey, Seon-u. It's me.

122
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,184
Where's Mi-jo?

123
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,229
What?

124
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,399
I see.

125
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,610
Okay, then.

126
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,154
All right. Bye.

127
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,824
What did he say?

128
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,704
Mi-jo wasn't feeling too well,
so they went camping.

129
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,084
They went camping
because she wasn't feeling well?

130
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,336
-Yes.
-What does that even mean?

131
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,178
You wanted her to be the happiest
terminally ill person in the world.

132
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,100
But because of that,
you're carrying all the burden.

133
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,019
You'll exhaust yourself.

134
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,688
I think I'm a coward.

135
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,649
Why?

136
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,863
"Maybe I should've
convinced her to get chemo."

137
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,660
"Maybe she could be
in that 0.8 percent and survive."

138
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,166
Those thoughts come to my mind
many times a day.

139
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,170
That doesn't make you a coward.

140
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,299
I feel like I decided to make her

141
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,678
the happiest terminally ill person
to ease my mind.

142
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,266
Since Chan-young wanted that,

143
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,934
I thought,

144
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,104
"Fine. I'll pretend to be happy."

145
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,151
I think I just compromised with myself.

146
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,913
I have a favor to ask of you.

147
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,210
As much as you think about Chan-young,

148
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,089
I wish you would
be considerate of yourself too.

149
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,220
I understand that
you can't help but worry about her.

150
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,724
But this is your first time camping.

151
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,731
So let's live in the present, okay?

152
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,943
How wonderful is this?
The weather is lovely,

153
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,570
and so is the air. Right?

154
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,663
You're not being a coward.

155
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,874
You're not selfish either.

156
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,512
We brought some sweet potatoes.

157
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,432
We bought them earlier. Let's bake them.

158
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,560
Then instant noodles for breakfast?

159
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,479
They taste the best in the morning.

160
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,357
Let me find them. Hold on.

161
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,577
Could you deliver this
to Unit 1002, please?

162
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,578
Sure.

163
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,205
May I know your name?

164
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,457
It's Kim Jin-seok.

165
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,958
-Mr. Kim Jin-seok?
-Yes.

166
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,713
That looks delicious.

167
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,519
You're eating that?

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,523
It's not bad to eat some dirt--

169
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,233
You're not a bum.

170
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,865
I was going to peel a new one for you.

171
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,783
I can't with you.

172
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,422
I left your bag and shoes
at the front desk.

173
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,382
Pick them up on your way home.

174
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,426
I hope you're not too unwell.

175
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,388
Goodness.

176
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,310
We need to focus on
these sweet potatoes, okay? Focus.

177
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,108
Focus and peel it well this time.

178
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,444
Drop one more, and I'm going home.

179
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,743
I still have one more left.

180
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,163
Good morning.

181
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,416
I'm on my way to work.

182
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,628
I see. Have a good day, then.

183
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,921
You too.

184
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,548
Damn it!

185
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,060
Hello.

186
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,113
Thanks for dropping off my bag and shoes.

187
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,115
No worries. It wasn't that far.

188
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,995
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

189
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,415
Yes.

190
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,129
I heard…

191
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,257
she came over.

192
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,259
She did.

193
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,933
Do you remember

194
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,520
when you came here
and bawled your eyes out?

195
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,316
I don't know why
I keep thinking of that day.

196
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,320
Mi-jo, what…

197
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,657
I'll kill you.

198
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,909
You!

199
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,954
I'll kill you!

200
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,165
Kim Jin-seok…

201
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,460
You jerk!

202
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,257
What should we do?

203
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,178
Life…

204
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,932
is so capricious.

205
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,852
Yesterday…

206
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,439
you looked so good together.

207
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,525
I almost believed

208
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,696
that you were Chan-young's boyfriend…

209
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,743
and that she was healthy.

210
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,706
Her mom was so excited
as if you were her son-in-law.

211
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,959
And I wanted to forget reality,

212
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,963
along with Joo-hee,

213
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,176
and believe that everything was peachy.

214
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,847
I just wanted to believe that.

215
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,518
Then when I opened the door,

216
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,356
your wife was standing there.

217
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,026
My heart sank.

218
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,072
It really sank.

219
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,158
So I begged her.

220
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,952
I asked her…

221
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,249
to turn a blind eye to it just this once.

222
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,506
Life…

223
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,843
sure is capricious, don't you think?

224
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,348
Yes.

225
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,321
I see.

226
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,658
I knew something was up,

227
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,828
but I didn't think it was that huge.

228
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,539
She'll give me an earful
if she finds out that I told you.

229
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,165
Let's just play dumb.

230
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,085
I was just curious.

231
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,421
Something was obviously wrong,
but she said it was fine.

232
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,714
So I couldn't believe her.

233
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,598
She's sacrificing a lot of things

234
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,350
because of me.

235
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,979
No, it's because of me.

236
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,814
You startled me.

237
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,774
I'm sorry.

238
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,902
I didn't mean to raise my voice. Sorry.

239
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:20,826
She only sacrificed her sabbatical
because she was infatuated with me,

240
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,162
but you said it was because of you,

241
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,038
so I got worked up.

242
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,713
I should've listened to her

243
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,466
when she told me to learn to play golf.

244
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,510
We could've golfed together.

245
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,222
Now that I'm dying,
I regret such little things.

246
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,976
Look, you see…

247
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,770
You're not holding yourself back
because of me, are you?

248
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,275
You're not young anymore.
Why don't you just move in with her?

249
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,779
You're imagining it.

250
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,573
It's nice, right?

251
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,745
It is.

252
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,252
Please have some fun with Mi-jo.

253
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,883
You should golf with her.
Wait, do you play golf?

254
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,301
Of course, I do.

255
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,969
Had I not become a doctor,

256
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,140
I'd be competing
against Tiger Woods in the US right now.

257
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,233
Come on. I was just trying to be funny.
Don't give me that look.

258
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,737
Could this be how others perceive me?

259
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,616
You seem like a big-time bluffer.

260
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,953
I do?

261
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,041
We're alike.

262
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,559
Hello, may I speak
with Manager Jang Joo-hee?

263
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,770
Sorry?

264
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,730
She quit?

265
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,069
One hot cappuccino, please.

266
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,737
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

267
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,840
Gosh, this is so annoying.

268
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:46,054
Damn it. I can't believe
I used to work in this building.

269
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,891
While I was slaving away downstairs,
they were being all elegant up here.

270
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,145
Don't tell me you're having coffee
at that department store.

271
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,772
She can do that.
Joo-hee, have an elegant coffee time.

272
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,569
Why would you? You're helping them
make money. What an idiot.

273
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,988
I just wanted to experience this, okay?

274
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,492
We were told
to gather at Chinatown by 8 p.m.

275
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,119
Told by whom?

276
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,122
The chef's treating us
to celebrate your resignation.

277
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,208
How did he find out?

278
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,337
Did you not give him your number?
Seon-u told me.

279
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,254
See you later.

280
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,882
Enjoy the ambience,
but don't stay there too long.

281
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,510
Don't tell me you ordered a cappuccino,
which sounds nice but tastes terrible.

282
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,348
Enjoy your coffee.

283
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,600
Thank you.

284
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,818
Gosh.

285
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,528
ONNURI CHILD CARE CENTER

286
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,058
You must be surprised.

287
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,644
Yes, I am a bit surprised.

288
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,481
I thought you were joking
when you asked if you could live here.

289
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,485
To be honest,
it's been a while since I left home.

290
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,112
I was looking for a place to live.

291
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,490
But when I visited here last time,
it felt really nice.

292
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,951
I'll clean and take care of the kids.

293
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,160
I'll earn my keep.

294
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,995
What a great decision.

295
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,456
I'm happy with that.

296
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,584
But did you discuss it with your brother?

297
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,337
I'm going to tell him soon.

298
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,966
You know how easily worried he gets.

299
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,634
Right, he does.

300
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,682
I'm sure he prefers

301
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,559
that I live here.

302
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,442
He'll visit us more often
if you live here.

303
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,196
I'd be the most delighted
to see you two more often.

304
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,240
Goodness. I'm so lucky.

305
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,291
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

306
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,670
I have a favor to ask.

307
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,339
What is it?

308
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,572
-Sorry you had to wait.
-It's okay.

309
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,823
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

310
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,074
Thank you.

311
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,289
Welcome.

312
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,541
Goodness. Hello, Ms. Jobless.

313
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,960
Darn it. How did you find out?

314
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,631
I called your store to order
some products for my girlfriend

315
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,049
since I couldn't step out.

316
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,135
Gosh. "I'm on my way to work."

317
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,721
No wonder it sounded super awkward.

318
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,475
Can I have more zha cai?

319
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,726
Sure.

320
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,895
Hey, can you give her more zha cai?

321
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,855
Wash your hands and help me out.

322
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,941
The part-timer quit, so it's been hectic.

323
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,485
-What?
-Work for me. I'll pay you handsomely.

324
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,362
Please? Hurry.

325
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,781
Gosh, I can't believe this.

326
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,991
I was going to take a few months off

327
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,701
and go on a trip.

328
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,119
Can I have another beer?

329
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,204
-Sure!
-Sure.

330
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,252
Here you go.

331
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,170
-Anything else?
-Thank you.

332
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,419
My father… I mean…

333
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,798
I've been living with money
the assemblyman gave me.

334
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,426
I want to give it back.

335
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:39,055
I want to give everything back
and live on my own.

336
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,942
Everything's on the house today.

337
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,362
It's to celebrate
my neighbor's resignation, so eat up.

338
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,363
Come on.

339
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,991
So what if there's good food?
I can't even eat it.

340
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,909
You always serve me soup and such.

341
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,870
There's a dish for you too, so wait.

342
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,538
-Really?
-Yes.

343
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,217
Since it's come to this,

344
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,470
let's party it up.

345
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,639
Oh, right. Let's play golf together.

346
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,142
Golf? With you?

347
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,226
Join us, Joo-hee.

348
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,395
Golf? Me?

349
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,065
I mean, we don't have to play golf there.

350
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,068
The scenery is lovely
and it's spacious there.

351
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,235
We can just stroll around.

352
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,863
That would look weird.

353
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,031
Hey, think about it.

354
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,409
What do you always see
next to beautiful grass?

355
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,036
"Do not enter."

356
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,163
"Do not hurt the grass."

357
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,498
That's it.

358
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,918
A golf course is teeming with grass.

359
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,463
We can step on it and run around.
No one will bat an eye if we lie down.

360
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,131
Lying down isn't right.

361
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,134
Right. I went too far there.

362
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,763
If we get tired,
we can just ride the cart.

363
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,889
What do you say? Nice?

364
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,225
Who did you hear those things from?

365
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,851
What do you mean?

366
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,399
You don't sound like someone
who's never been to a golf course before.

367
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,736
You should go with her.
It's covered in grass.

368
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,530
You can walk around.

369
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,157
If you get tired, ride around in the cart.
You'll feel great.

370
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:26,162
Goodness, you can find everything
about it on social media.

371
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,584
In any case, I can't go.

372
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,795
But you're jobless.

373
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,588
You'd be bored at home.

374
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,798
I have a new job.

375
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,050
-What?
-I work here part-time.

376
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,809
Hey, you did something right
for the first time in your life.

377
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,520
How did you think to do
such a praiseworthy act?

378
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,940
Ms. Jang, I believe
you have a big picture in mind.

379
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,694
What are you talking about?
Stop talking nonsense.

380
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,867
Right. Let's just hang out here instead.

381
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,828
You want to play golf?
You don't even know how to.

382
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,539
If Joo-hee can't go,
then it'll be just us three.

383
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,707
What? Three?

384
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,835
Who are you calling?

385
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,338
-Hey.
-Hey, did you make a reservation?

386
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,883
Chuncheon is perfect.

387
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,677
What was that?

388
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,137
KIM SEON-U

389
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,015
Our dear Seon-u, you, and me.

390
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:27,932
To Chuncheon.

391
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,435
I'm so excited.

392
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,312
-Hey.
-What?

393
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,480
What's with you?

394
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,982
I bet he's good at golf.

395
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,735
Really?

396
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:43,490
I asked him what he did for fun in the US.
He said he mostly golfed.

397
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,287
Gosh. Look at those eyes.

398
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,331
Why are you getting all competitive?

399
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,875
Do you know exactly how good he is?

400
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,715
-What's a "single-digit handicap"?
-Single-digit?

401
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,985
Yes, it's all about distance for men.

402
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,404
Good.

403
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,077
They rent golf clubs, right?

404
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,204
It doesn't make sense for me to buy them.

405
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:35,625
Please. I'm really not going.
I don't want to golf.

406
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,669
Why not?

407
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,712
I'll go next time.

408
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,256
When? After I die?

409
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,175
What's wrong with you? Don't say that.

410
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,177
What is wrong with you?

411
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:50,306
Why do you keep yourself
from doing what you like because of me?

412
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,434
Don't worry about me.

413
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,272
Mi-jo.

414
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,818
I want things to be the same.

415
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,906
I just want everything
to be the same as before.

416
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,951
But your doing that
reminds me that it's not.

417
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,663
It reminds me of how sick I am.

418
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,292
Fine, let's go. Let's play golf.

419
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,460
No need to borrow clubs. I have extra.

420
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,590
What if I'm better at golf
than I thought I'd be?

421
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,967
You would have
a single-digit handicap in talking.

422
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,760
You don't even know what that means.

423
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,391
By the way, I hope Joo-hee doesn't sulk.

424
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,643
She said we tended
to leave her out of things.

425
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,813
How could she leave
when her boss is still at work?

426
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,150
Let's not push too much
when he already has a girlfriend.

427
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,652
She may not act like it,
but she's holding her breath.

428
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,321
Let's be honest.

429
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,489
Can she not hold
a candle to his girlfriend?

430
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,491
Of course, she can.

431
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,912
Except for the fact
that she's a little older.

432
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,539
Being a few years older isn't that bad.

433
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,460
Don't worry about Joo-hee.

434
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,295
You should take care of yourself.

435
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,255
I'm feeling good these days.

436
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,633
Are you not in pain?

437
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,595
No. At times, I can't believe
I really have cancer.

438
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,680
Should we sit down?

439
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,182
Sure.

440
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,903
Now that Joo-hee's on the battlefield,
she'll fend for herself.

441
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,490
Hey, I asked
the director of the care center.

442
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,576
-About what?
-Your biological mom.

443
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,578
What for?

444
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,747
I told you.

445
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,209
I'm going to get Joo-hee a boyfriend
and find your real mom.

446
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,920
What's the point of finding her now?

447
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,173
You've been wondering all your life.

448
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,848
Am I wrong?

449
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,141
Yes, you are.

450
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,353
Really?

451
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,732
So? What did she say?

452
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,029
Remember that "Siloam Snack Bar" memo?

453
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,616
That's the reason you went
to that snack bar in Gocheok-dong.

454
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:19,497
Apparently, your mom had called
from that place, saying she worked there.

455
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,374
That's why she wrote that down.

456
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,088
But Joo-hee's mom said
she didn't work there. She wouldn't lie.

457
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,882
That's true.

458
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,557
This is a difficult one.

459
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,101
Why don't you have any?

460
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,186
Any what?

461
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,397
Items on a bucket list.

462
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,275
Forget about Joo-hee and me.

463
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,402
Why don't you have anything
you want to do?

464
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,988
Well, I just don't.

465
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,865
Don't lie.

466
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,783
Everyone has something they want to do.

467
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,128
Should we go?

468
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,963
Let's go.

469
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,100
I said you could leave first.

470
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,270
I want to get on my boss's good side.

471
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,691
Right. Can you please not tell my mom

472
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,818
that I'm working here?

473
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,780
She comes here often.
She'll soon find out.

474
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,409
I know. She's not a fan of Chinese food,
so why does she come here so often?

475
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,706
Just tell her already, before
she finds out and gives you hell here.

476
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,542
Gosh. Her slaps are really painful.

477
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,922
I'll tell her I recruited you,

478
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,924
the queen of hospitality.

479
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,053
That won't work.
I guess I'll just put up with a slap.

480
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,432
I'm only saying this
because it won't end at that.

481
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,642
How did you know?

482
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,519
You're scary.

483
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,402
DIVORCE AGREEMENT FORM

484
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,620
CEO KIM JIN-SEOK

485
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,672
-Yes?
-I won't sign this.

486
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,132
Don't hold your breath.

487
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,134
Fine, then my lawyer will contact yours.

488
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,694
I'm glad I didn't buy a washing machine.

489
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,967
Hello?

490
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,218
Where are you?

491
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,136
At the laundromat.

492
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,680
I also had laundry in my trunk, you know?

493
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,601
Shouldn't you be doing this for me,
not the other way around?

494
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,978
I'll do the laundry from now on.

495
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,734
Aren't you bored there?
I could've tagged along.

496
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,111
It feels weird.

497
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,033
I used to find laundromats really boring.

498
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,829
I'd go somewhere else to eat

499
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,666
or have coffee while waiting.

500
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,007
I can't believe
I find it entertaining now.

501
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,847
It's done.

502
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,682
I'll talk to you later.

503
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,302
Why would you bring Seon-u
over to our house?

504
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:47,014
Don't read too much into it.
I'd just like us to have a meal together.

505
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,892
Your face says otherwise.

506
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,228
You do know that our dad,

507
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,606
Professor Cha, invested his severance pay
in this clinic, right?

508
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,942
Gosh, that's so cheap.

509
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,319
I know it wasn't a hefty sum.

510
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,030
But come on. Is it that weird
for someone who has invested

511
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,158
in this clinic
to have a meal with a new doctor?

512
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,619
Yes. It's extremely weird.

513
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,915
But he's your boyfriend.

514
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,625
Lower your voice, will you?

515
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,627
You're adults, you know?

516
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,756
Hey, even pre-teens visit
each other's parents nowadays.

517
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,967
There's no point talking to you.

518
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,428
Let's invite him over this evening.

519
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,179
Mom's cooking ribs.

520
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,683
Forget it.
Don't you dare mention it to him.

521
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,184
Then when will you do it?

522
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,437
When you get married. Happy?

523
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,274
That means never!

524
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,530
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO

525
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,489
Come in.

526
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,493
Have you been practicing golfing?

527
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,749
Rumor has it that you're pretty good.

528
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,127
What's so hard about it?
You hit the ball and it flies.

529
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,841
Controlling your power is the hardest,
but it's a cakewalk for you?

530
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,968
I guess you're pretty good.

531
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:11,015
I shouldn't brag too much in front
of someone who almost went abroad to golf.

532
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,270
Are we okay with taking just my car?

533
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:21,650
I'll pick you up before Chan-young.
Joo-hee won't make it, right?

534
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,321
But I'm still worried
that Chan-young might be exhausted.

535
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,740
We'll just do nine holes
if that's the case.

536
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,657
Okay.

537
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,288
Try these balls out
at the golf course tomorrow.

538
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,542
If you're not too busy,
take a look at them right now.

539
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,810
What has he done to them?

540
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,229
IS SEON-U THAT IRRESISTIBLE?
NICE SHOT, DR. CHA

541
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,440
THE GODDESS OF GOLF IS HERE
SWING YOUR WORRIES AWAY!

542
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,529
Damn it.

543
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,910
Again.

544
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,338
"The goddess of golf"?

545
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,716
How adorable.

546
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,804
They suddenly changed the audition date.

547
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,723
It's tomorrow. What should I do?

548
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,102
I've never acted
the role of a reporter before.

549
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,478
I'm in trouble.

550
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,444
Ms. Jeong.

551
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,407
I don't think I can coach you anymore.

552
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,576
Why not?

553
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,495
I'm afraid you're on your own this time.

554
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,791
Or I can introduce you to someone else.

555
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,294
Did I do something wrong?

556
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,588
Why out of the blue?

557
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,964
Why don't you have any?

558
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,966
Items on a bucket list.

559
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,719
Forget about Joo-hee and me.

560
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,304
Why don't you have anything
you want to do?

561
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,476
I'm going to audition for this role too.

562
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,357
Hey, that's Dad.

563
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,984
Mom must've made him pick Coke up.

564
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,319
Let me get out.

565
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,238
-Let's just have him hop on.
-Let me out!

566
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,782
-Don't act like a kid in front of me.
-Hurry up.

567
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,910
Do that in front of your boyfriend.

568
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:41,624
People think I don't know

569
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,336
What heartbreaks are at this age

570
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,379
-Dad!
-You startled me!

571
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,089
Where did you come from?

572
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,634
-Dad, you should hurry.
-Okay. Go.

573
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,718
Let's go.

574
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,847
Did you buy Coke?

575
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,435
Your mom always forgets
one item when grocery shopping.

576
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,521
Then she makes me go buy it.

577
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,022
Maybe it's intentional.

578
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,026
Judging by how frequently it happens,
I do have my suspicions.

579
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,617
Dad.

580
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,701
Yes?

581
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:19,995
You see…

582
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,959
Despite everything that's been happening,
I got a boyfriend.

583
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,128
Gosh.

584
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,134
-I'm a bad friend, aren't I?
-Of course not.

585
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,554
Think about it.

586
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,847
While she's battling cancer,

587
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,559
I got myself a new boyfriend.

588
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,779
Is Chan-young hurt by that?

589
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,365
Of course not. She would never.

590
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,535
I just feel bad. That's all.

591
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,663
So you feel guilty.

592
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,791
Something like that.

593
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,839
After my retirement, I'm home every day.

594
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,175
But your mom
often goes out with her friends.

595
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,388
That's why your mom and I
are still happily married.

596
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,557
What are you getting at?

597
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,397
Letting each other do whatever they want
is respecting each other.

598
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,194
Let's have some whiskey.

599
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,988
No, I have to play golf tomorrow.

600
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,451
Come on. We're having ribs tonight.

601
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,328
Didn't you just talk about respect?

602
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,206
I'll just drink with Mi-hyeon.

603
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,085
I guess a glass won't hurt.
I'll call a chauffeur.

604
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,058
Chan-young is impressive.

605
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,226
Of course, she'll pass the audition.

606
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,232
I wonder how it'd feel
to watch her movie at the theater.

607
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,026
Wait, is it a drama?

608
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,072
Should I come with you?

609
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,283
Isn't it sad to go to
the audition by yourself?

610
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,411
Are you my mom?

611
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,581
Even moms don't come to
their kids' auditions. It's embarrassing!

612
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,918
I'll just wait outside, okay?

613
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,337
Jin-seok is coming with me.

614
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,630
And listen carefully.

615
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,840
If you skip golf and come to my audition,

616
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,885
I'll cut ties with you.
I need to get into character. Bye.

617
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,520
Why aren't you dressed?

618
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,271
I have a meeting at work.

619
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,233
I called Mr. Cha, so take the van.

620
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,236
You should drive me there.

621
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,196
-I said I had a meeting.
-Bullshit.

622
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,614
I'll call and check.

623
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,158
Just take the van. It's safer.

624
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,160
Mr. Cha is a good driver.

625
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,126
-Are you getting cold feet?
-Yes.

626
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,669
No.

627
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,587
You obviously are.

628
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,757
Fine, I am getting cold feet.

629
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,175
So go with Mr. Cha.

630
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,596
Do you still think it's your fault?

631
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,770
Stop shaking. You'll drive away good luck.

632
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,980
I have no more luck left.

633
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:38,193
Come on. Please come with me.

634
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,363
This is really nerve-racking for me.

635
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,167
I think I'll do a better job

636
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,587
if you come with me.

637
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,174
So please come and support me.

638
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,718
Please?

639
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,595
Please?

640
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,353
But I'm not confident.

641
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,690
Let's go.

642
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,817
Let's do this.

643
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,613
I can do this. Yes, I can.

644
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,552
My driver, please.

645
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,476
Let's go. Come on.

646
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,272
We paid for four people today,

647
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,149
so we need to focus even more.

648
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,401
Let's enjoy and have a blast today, okay?

649
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,904
The audition will go well, right?

650
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:08,033
You need to enjoy your time here
for her to audition in peace.

651
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,161
She wanted us to be here.
Will you keep being like this?

652
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,792
All right.

653
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,671
I'll focus. How many birdies
do you want me to make?

654
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,132
You can decide after seeing my birdies.

655
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,804
Loser buys dinner. What do you say?

656
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,014
Deal. The most expensive dinner.

657
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,766
You'll be the one buying.

658
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,894
Take your time and pick out a restaurant.

659
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,950
Ball!

660
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,830
Give me another chance.

661
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,000
We made a bet.
We're doing this fair and square.

662
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,712
How brutal.

663
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,884
I prefer instant coffee.

664
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,429
This is much tastier than Americano.

665
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,639
My mom loved this too.

666
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,310
She used to order tons
from Korea and drink them in the US.

667
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,937
She was just like me.

668
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,151
So-won.

669
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:29,698
Can you tell me what happened?

670
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,869
It's nothing much.

671
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,915
I may not know you
like the back of my hand,

672
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,793
but I know you wouldn't ask
your adoptive parents

673
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,130
to disown you as an adult
and leave home for no good reason.

674
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:48,842
I also don't understand why you want
to give back your father's money now.

675
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,766
Am I worried for nothing?

676
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,393
It's just…

677
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,731
After my mom passed away, I just…

678
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,318
Why did you quit piano?

679
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,613
It'd be wonderful
if you could teach the kids here.

680
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,574
No. I don't play anymore.

681
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,334
So-won, what's wrong?

682
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,211
What happened?

683
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,630
NICE SHOT, DR. CHA

684
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,013
Nice.

685
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,356
How have you been?

686
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,486
No reason. I just wanted
to know how you've been doing.

687
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,573
Hello.

688
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,787
We're all doing well.

689
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,915
How is your health?

690
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,959
Things here are similar to out there.

691
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,795
If I have enough money, I'm healthy.

692
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,840
If I don't, I feel famished.

693
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,635
How's Ji-min doing?

694
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,929
Has she gotten married yet?

695
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,019
Thank you for offering to help every time.

696
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,356
My time here will be
much more comfortable if you do.

697
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,110
More to the right?

698
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,779
No, to the left.

699
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,198
Right, it's to the left from your side?

700
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,075
Let's see.

701
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,577
-Good.
-Okay.

702
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,211
That's it.

703
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,841
-Okay.
-It was to the right.

704
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,886
I was right.

705
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,221
You did well.

706
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,060
YOUR MONEY HAS BEEN SENT

707
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,114
LEE GYEONG-SUK, YEONGWOL PRISON

708
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,760
Honey, you don't look too well.

709
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,140
She called.

710
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,603
It was about time she did.

711
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,856
She's been asking
about Mi-jo more often lately.

712
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,526
She's her mother.
It's natural she's curious.

713
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,158
Every time she calls her Ji-min,

714
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,203
my heart sinks.

715
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,425
So-won.

716
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,678
He asked me to.

717
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,098
What do you mean?

718
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,143
He wanted me to ask him to disown me.

719
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,482
He asked me to do it.

720
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:53,962
Give me a mulligan.

721
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,464
There's no mulligan here. We made a bet.

722
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,383
-Let's move on.
-Just this once.

723
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,843
It's out of bounds.

724
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,678
You're so cheap.

725
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,606
You were an acting coach
for quite some time.

726
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,274
Yes, I was.

727
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:00,403
Before you came,
I asked a few actors about you.

728
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,572
I'm sorry if that was rude.

729
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,407
Not at all, sir.

730
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,035
I didn't know what to think of it.

731
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:10,246
I learned that you coached
quite a few famous actors.

732
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,958
So why would you audition
for a role yourself?

733
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:13,875
Goodness.

734
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,921
I wanted something to remember.

735
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:25,261
No one wants to be
an acting coach from the beginning.

736
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,849
I wanted to be an actress.

737
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,977
But it wasn't easy.

738
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,314
I had a chance,
but I missed it for personal reasons.

739
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,941
Am I your manager or something?

740
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,193
You were given a vehicle
and even a manager,

741
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,070
so why would you call me when I'm busy?

742
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,863
It's my first shoot.

743
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,573
You should be there.

744
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,827
I took a precious leave
for your first shoot.

745
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,287
What about when we go on a trip?
Should I skip work?

746
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,291
Why do you even work at a company
that makes instant noodles?

747
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,878
"What does your father do?"

748
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,840
"He's the chairman of Jinsa Food."

749
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,383
"Is that right?"

750
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,011
"Then cook me some noodles."

751
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,180
Why are you bringing up my family here?

752
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,641
I'm just nervous. That's all.

753
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,893
Pretend that I'm there,
and it'll be a piece of--

754
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,936
Chan-young!

755
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,915
I love acting.

756
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:40,003
So I couldn't bring myself
to find another job.

757
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,380
That's how I became an acting coach.

758
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,718
"Just one more. I'll quit
after teaching one more student."

759
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,680
Then before I knew it, I was 39 years old.

760
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,896
I really want to be
a part of a great project

761
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,564
before it's too late.

762
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,817
It's the perfect age to be an actor.

763
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,445
Show us what you've prepared.

764
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,214
How did you do?

765
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,051
Look at your face.

766
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,387
My mom had the same look
when I took the CSAT.

767
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,808
Answer me. Did you
pull it off well without any mistakes?

768
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,976
Why would I make a mistake?

769
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,481
My acting skills improve day by day.

770
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,900
-You made it.
-They said they'd call.

771
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,528
What does that mean?

772
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,281
They were flustered.

773
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,951
We found the perfect fit
for the role of Reporter Cho.

774
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,495
-Let's stop auditioning for the role.
-Yes, sir.

775
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,746
Thank you.

776
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,541
You can plan out
your filming schedule with him.

777
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,293
But the thing is…

778
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,130
Well…

779
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:09,259
Would it be possible
to shoot all my scenes early?

780
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,470
I know it's a small role. I'm sorry.

781
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,973
You see…

782
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,811
I won't be alive for long.

783
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,271
Sorry?

784
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,690
I have…

785
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,025
cancer.

786
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,950
Ridiculous, right?

787
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,289
You said that?

788
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,252
I shouldn't keep it from them, right?

789
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,879
You're right.

790
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,425
Let's go. Now that it's all over,
I'm getting sleepy.

791
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:53,052
Okay. Well done.

792
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,264
Thanks.

793
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,141
You did well.

794
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,601
Let's go.

795
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,352
Well done, Chan-young.

796
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:14,157
Find out where her parents live.

797
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,117
Immediately.

798
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,045
JEONG'S KITCHEN

799
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,132
There's nothing to sweep.
Stop pretending to clean.

800
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,469
Goodness. I'm just making way
for luck to enter our restaurant.

801
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,392
Are you that happy that your old daughter
is living with her boyfriend?

802
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,186
Turn a blind eye to it.

803
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,855
Kids nowadays move in together
before getting married.

804
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,441
We don't even know him.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

805
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,402
Why does it matter?
We should marry her off

806
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,655
if there's a man who loves her.

807
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,865
I can't believe you. Give me another one.

808
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,874
I hadn't golfed in a while,
so it was pretty fun.

809
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,794
Are we headed to Chinatown?

810
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,838
We meet up there every day.

811
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,132
We met up before
when Joo-hee quit her job.

812
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,426
And now,
it's because Chan-young auditioned.

813
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,637
It's going to become our hangout spot.

814
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,057
By the way, why did Joo-hee quit her job?

815
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,352
She fought with
an obnoxious customer and quit.

816
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,395
Oh, dear.

817
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:30,233
Both of your friends are quite feisty.
They're so cool. I'm impressed.

818
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,484
They take after me.

819
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,487
What?

820
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,197
DIRECTOR OF ONNURI

821
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,951
Hello, ma'am.

822
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,912
Yes, I'm doing well. How about you?

823
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:46,958
Sorry?

824
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,378
Oh, I see.

825
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,799
It must've been tough for her.

826
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,762
Yes, ma'am. I'll speak with So-won.

827
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,806
Goodbye.

828
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,643
Was that the director?

829
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,978
Yes.

830
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,315
So-won moved into the child care center.

831
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:11,733
Out of the blue?

832
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,735
Yes.

833
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,655
You should go see her.
I wonder what happened.

834
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,407
I think I should.

835
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,661
You can drop me off over there.
I can get a cab.

836
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,414
No, I'll drop you off at Chinatown.
It's on the way anyway.

837
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,057
-Hello.
-Hi. Sit down.

838
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,938
I'm sorry I asked you
to meet with me when you must be busy.

839
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,857
Don't be. It's my day off anyway.

840
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,569
And So-won…

841
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,530
She doesn't know that you're here.

842
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,791
You know what?
All of your dishes are delicious.

843
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,417
-I agree.
-Thank you.

844
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,961
How did Seon-u do today?

845
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,048
-He went over 100 strokes.
-I see. What?

846
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,967
He went over 100 strokes?

847
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,554
Then he must've been
too embarrassed to come here.

848
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,807
Didn't you say he was a single-digit?

849
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,101
What I meant was,

850
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,146
he was single before he met you.

851
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,525
-Come on.
-He didn't lie, you know?

852
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,235
Goodness.

853
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,366
I love this gathering.

854
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,201
Let's make this a regular thing.

855
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:48,579
-Let's meet up seven times a day.
-Seven times?

856
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,331
-That's every day.
-And Seon-u.

857
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,249
My poor wrists.

858
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,168
-I'm not part of this.
-Seven times? Don't be ridiculous.

859
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,878
-Hye-jin.
-You were…

860
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,255
I'm glad you're here.

861
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,881
Sit here.

862
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,180
Can we talk?

863
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,565
Please excuse me. I'll be back soon.

864
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:43,760
Why didn't you tell me?

865
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,428
Tell you what?

866
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,848
My mom and I ate at Hanguk Hotel.

867
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,224
At the Chinese restaurant.

868
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,727
The manager came to say hello

869
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,605
and asked me to persuade you.

870
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,191
-Hye-jin, I…
-He wanted you to return.

871
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,903
He said you'd be the head chef.

872
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,449
I'm already the head chef
of my restaurant.

873
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,203
They're not the same.

874
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,749
A hotel restaurant
and one in an alley aren't the same.

875
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,795
You don't love me, do you?

876
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,757
How could you say that?
Of course, I love you.

877
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,468
If you truly cared about me,

878
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,595
you would've returned to the hotel.

879
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,933
You would be a hotel chef instead
of that small restaurant chef for me!

880
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,935
What are you thinking?

881
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,275
You must be really disappointed.

882
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,199
Am I wrong?

883
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,828
Ask anyone.

884
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,665
When we encounter

885
01:03:56,749 --> 01:04:00,294
an inconvenient truth,
the truth itself isn't…

886
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,924
what makes us flustered.

887
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,008
Goodness.

888
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,015
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

889
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,227
Are you Ms. Jeong Chan-young's parents?

890
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,234
We become flustered

891
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:27,780
because we finally encounter
something ominous

892
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,409
that we've strived so hard to bottle up.

893
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:39,876
Why don't we take a break?

894
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,638
-Mom!
-Hey.

895
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,101
Goodness. Did you guys drink again?

896
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,853
Yes. Do I reek of alcohol?

897
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,523
I'll walk you home so I can sober up.

898
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,113
Mom.

899
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,406
Yes?

900
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:14,452
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

901
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,204
What?

902
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:20,499
I swear I saw it.

903
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,544
"Siloam Snack Bar" was on my documents.

904
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:29,383
It said my real mom called the director
and said she was working there.

905
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,260
That's not true, right?

906
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,056
Chan-young won't stop looking into that.

907
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:38,935
Despite being sick,
she wants to find my real mom for me.

908
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:44,607
That's not true, right?
Can you please tell her it's not true?

909
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,244
Mom.

910
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,259
I can't believe

911
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,304
that Seon-u exceeded 100 strokes.

912
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,809
What's wrong? Are you okay?

913
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,728
Yes. I'm okay.

914
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,480
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm fine.

915
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:26,691
I think I have indigestion.

916
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,775
Really?

917
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,277
Your daughter…

918
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,614
is seeing my husband.

919
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,419
How could I give this to him

920
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,130
when I'm fuming like this?

921
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,674
I can't bear to face your father.

922
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:59,432
How could he tell So-won
to ask him to disown her?

923
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:07,523
Was it because he didn't want her
to inherit any of his fortune?

924
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,513
All this time,

925
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,602
I've kept this…

926
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,606
from you.

927
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,111
I'm sorry, Mi-jo.

928
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,824
I know…

929
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:04,830
who your biological mother is.

930
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,829
That is why

931
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:49,542
we feel uneasy about the truth.

932
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,914
Will we be able to muster up strength

933
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,833
before the uneasiness turns into fear?

934
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,345
You're going to the States?

935
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,680
Don't even think about coming back.

936
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,182
Find a job in the States.

937
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,478
It's better to end things amicably.

938
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,729
Or you'll regret it later.

939
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:38,692
I want us to part as friends, not lovers.

940
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,444
Do I embarrass you?

941
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,948
Because you don't know
who my biological parents are?

942
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,574
Does that scare you now?

943
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:49,745
Do you want to know?

944
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:56,418
