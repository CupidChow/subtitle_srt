1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Always

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There is no miracle, no miracle, the waves are in the river

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The falling flowers are flowing, no water is no shadow

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The flowers of life are like dreams, like you

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no breath, no breath

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The history is not clear

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain of another life

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Dad

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Dad

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Dad

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Dad

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
How long will it take?

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,280
Father.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,080
Cu.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,520
Didn't you go to the Sword Pavilion

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,840
to worship the great swordsman?

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,680
Why are you here?

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,880
What is inside this base?

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,280
Cu.

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,520
Come.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Come.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,360
Cu.

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,520
Now,

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,560
I don't want to hide something from you.

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,760
I want to save a little bit of my life.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,320
If we two are together,

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,240
we can be in the Three Realms.

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,040
I wanted to use

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,520
the Demon Lord Chong Guang to attack Mount Bu Zhoushan

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,080
to use Mo Xiao

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
to open the seal of the World Order.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,920
But I didn't expect that

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
Chong Guang is so incompetent.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
Now the Demon Lord Chong Guang is destroyed.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,400
He can't control Mo Xiao anymore.

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
So, there are some things

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,040
that I have to deal with myself.

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,400
Father.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,360
As the chief of Mount Su, you are so self-righteous.

61
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,280
Where is the place where Mount Su is located?

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,760
Besides,

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
Mount Bu Zhoushan has the seal of the World Order

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,560
to protect the people.

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,960
And there is the seal of the World Order

66
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,080
to protect the people.

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
How can you be so proud?

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,320
Father.

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,640
Don't be so selfish.

70
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,960
Go back.

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,080
Cu.

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,640
I am As the chief of Mount Su now.

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,780
So, I must

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
I just have to designed

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,280
a seal of the world Order.

76
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,640
Father.

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
Stop trying to make trouble now.

78
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
It's too late now.

79
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,800
Cui'er, with you,

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
we will try to fix the case now.

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,120
I will complete the case.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Cui'er.

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,040
I didn't expect you to be so naive.

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
You are a born father.

85
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Do you think your father and I will kneel in front of others to beg for mercy?

86
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,120
When your father succeeds, it's their turn to kneel down and beg for mercy.

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Do you understand?

88
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Father, I won't let you go.

89
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Unless you kill me!

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Let go of my hand.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Let go of my hand!

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
You bastard.

93
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
You really are a big bastard.

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
You really are a big bastard.

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
You really are a big bastard.

96
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Father.

97
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,120
I didn't expect that you would be so shameless.

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Father.

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Father, don't go.

100
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Father.

101
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Father.

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Don't go.

103
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Father.

104
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Father.

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
I beg you, father.

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Father.

107
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Ling Yun.

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Ling Yun.

109
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
You are finally awake.

110
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
How come you are awake?

111
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Do you know how hard I've been when you were not here?

112
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm sorry, Qing'er.

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I made you worried.

114
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,120
But I'm fine now.

115
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I...

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I should tell Uncle Xuan Zhen and Uncle Xie.

117
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
They will be happy.

118
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Qing'er, Ling Yun is awake.

119
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
How is she?

120
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Ling Yun, you are really awake.

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Do you feel hungry?

122
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
What do you want to eat?

123
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I'll make you some food.

124
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Father, I'm fine.

125
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
I think you should stop worrying.

126
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Let's observe first.

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Okay.

128
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Brother.

129
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Hurry up.

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Stop him.

131
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Father is going to Mount Bu.

132
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Take care of him.

133
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
What?

134
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,120
I didn't expect that he would be so cruel.

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
He forced Brother Xie to leave Mo Xiao.

136
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
He even left his own son.

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,120
I didn't expect that in this period of time,

138
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
so many things happened.

139
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Uncle Murong...

140
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Uncle, father has been in the desert.

141
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
He won't go back.

142
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,120
The most important thing is to pass on his conspiracy to the people.

143
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Otherwise, the people will use him.

144
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
I don't know if he will be able to do that.

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,120
I don't know how many people will die.

146
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
You are right.

147
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
It's about Qianqiu Law.

148
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Whether he colluded with the devil or the devil,

149
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,120
the people are all blinded by him.

150
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,120
If he uses the power of the gate of Mount Su,

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
the consequences will be dire.

152
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,120
But he is still the leader of Mount Su.

153
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,120
How can we let the people believe us?

154
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
You have a way.

155
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
The token?

156
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Why is it in your hand?

157
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
Brother Mo Xiao gave it to me.

158
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Take this back.

159
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,120
If you do anything against the law,

160
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
you can give it to Uncle Xie.

161
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Let him use the law of Mount Su

162
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
to get rid of the people who are in the gate of Mount Murong.

163
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Brother Yuan is dead.

164
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
He is in a good mood.

165
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Although Mo Xiao is not in Mount Su,

166
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,120
we must protect Mount Su.

167
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Protect Qianqiu Law.

168
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,520
Listen.

169
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,320
Ho...

170
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
You...

171
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,280
You...

172
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,720
You'll get destroyed.

173
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,720
How did I spank your name?

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't comfort your body with your hands.

175
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,060
Mr. Bai.

176
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Ni Huo.

177
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Lin Xu.

178
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,920
Why did you go out so early?

179
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
I had a lot of things to do at home.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
I went to the nearby market

181
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
and bought some.

182
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
What did you buy?

183
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,960
Well,

184
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,840
you helped me to get two fish back.

185
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
There's a surprise coming back.

186
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
What surprise?

187
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,760
Go back and you'll know.

188
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,600
Okay.

189
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,960
It's all bad.

190
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,840
I paid 17ank to親 lasting round.

191
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
What a huge battle.

192
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,240
Causing a bad outcome.

193
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,440
Although I have lost the battle over here,

194
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,200
I couldn't lose the business.

195
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
Stop and end the laws.

196
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
My lord.

197
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,560
It's really a great honor for the three realms.

198
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,860
For the three realms, Bai Yan, you're too old to be a good person.

199
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,660
I'm Ni Huo.

200
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,760
Because of a Qinian spirit,

201
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,160
I heard that Bai Yu's spirit energy can bring me back to the破散原神.

202
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Huo Lang.

203
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Huo Lang.

204
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,860
Master.

205
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Help me find out who Bai Yan is.

206
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,460
Who are you, Ni Huo?

207
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Why did you suddenly mention these two names?

208
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
I don't know how.

209
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,060
Since the Demon Realm came out,

210
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,860
I have a memory of someone else in my mind that I don't mention these two names.

211
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,460
But every time I chase after the spirit,

212
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,060
I feel so painful.

213
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,860
Master, you're finally awake.

214
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,660
What is that?

215
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Bai Yan is your godly name.

216
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,860
You're the godly warrior of the Heavenly Realm, Bai Yan.

217
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,460
Bai Yan?

218
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,060
God of War?

219
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,660
If you say that,

220
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,660
in this lifetime, Li Xue is Ni Huo.

221
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,460
Li Xue is Ni Huo.

222
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,260
I used the Dragon Bead to play out your true and false spirit.

223
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,860
I fell into the Immortal Formation and became a human.

224
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,660
After this,

225
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,260
no one in the Three Realms can find you.

226
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Only me.

227
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,260
This might be...

228
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,460
I finally found you.

229
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,060
You are the

230
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,620
Sun, Usually?

231
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Your name is not practicing.

232
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,260
Its name is Wu Yao.

233
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,360
Spomny!

234
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,160
Its name is Zhao Hsu...

235
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Zhao Hsu...

236
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,860
Zhao Zhao Hsu still losens the Land of Qu Harp.

237
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,860
I'm not the master of the Shushan Sect.

238
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,860
You're the husband of Feng Li Xue.

239
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,860
The Shushan Sect

240
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
Mother.

241
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
How is it?

242
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Did I get any news?

243
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
The secret letter from each of the Flower狼.

244
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,860
I didn't expect that the Shushan Sect would not give up on this.

245
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Is there still no news from the Wuxiang Palace?

246
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Tianmuling was destroyed.

247
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
The attack on Chongguang was also very big.

248
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,860
Plus the reaction of Li Xue and Tianmuyuan's Ice Talisman.

249
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
He's still in the museum.

250
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,860
Mother, what should we do now?

251
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Xu Yuan Xingzhu. Long time no see.

252
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Do you still remember me?

253
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,860
I was in the Wuxiang Palace for a long time.

254
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,860
Wuxiang came to pick you up.

255
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
To pick me up?

256
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
Chongguang asked you to come.

257
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
When the Wuxiang Palace was established,

258
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Chongguang was taken to the Demon Realm.

259
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
Wuxiang told you that

260
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
if you endure more days,

261
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
when the time comes,

262
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,860
I will come to pick you up.

263
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,860
So,

264
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
the time has come.

265
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
It's here.

266
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,860
You've found your son.

267
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
You've seen him before.

268
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,860
He's the heir of the Wuxiang Palace.

269
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
Mo Xiao.

270
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
He's in the Shushan?

271
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Then...

272
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
I know that

273
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,860
he's the son of Ye Yuan.

274
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
He's the son of Ye Yuan.

275
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,860
He's the son of the Tian Mo Sect's Young Master.

276
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,860
I have something for you today.

277
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Mo Xiao's master asked him to give it to you.

278
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,860
Are you happy to hear that?

279
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
No, I don't want to...

280
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Mother.

281
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,860
You...

282
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
Theιreweries.

283
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,860
It's him doing this.

284
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
He wants Mo Xiao to send me.

285
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,580
No more.

286
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,460
He left this to you.

287
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,300
No more.

288
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,300
He died in Mount Shu.

289
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,300
He's dead.

290
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,340
Because Mo Xiao

291
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,180
was taken away by the son of Ye Yuan.

292
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,540
Xie Meng,

293
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,260
he was the one who did it.

294
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,420
He didn't want to be humiliated

295
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,660
and commit suicide.

296
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,660
No.

297
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,940
No.

298
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,500
How could he?

299
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,820
He didn't apologize to me.

300
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,380
He didn't say he was wrong.

301
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,380
How could he die?

302
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,820
How could he die?

303
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,500
How could he?

304
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,660
No.

305
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
He got back your security record,

306
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,580
and he left a kind heart to you.

307
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:39,340
This is a takeaway you willopian

308
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,740
to Xie Meng borrow the边カые

309
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,560
but you're going to 分开

310
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,260
The world is now full of two ways.

311
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
It's hard to find a way out.

312
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Please, my love.

313
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
You go out with me.

314
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,260
We still have more important things to do.

315
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Master.

316
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,260
Master, we're in a hurry to summon Chang Ming.

317
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
But we really have to go to the Sky Castle.

318
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
The Sky Castle is destroyed.

319
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
The Chong Guang is useless.

320
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,260
As long as Mo Xiao comes, I can still take the order.

321
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Master, Chong Guang is just in the closed palace.

322
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,260
If he wakes up and finds out that the master went to the capital,

323
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
he will definitely rush to the capital.

324
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,260
In addition, Mo Xiao is already in danger.

325
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
Why don't we...

326
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
What do you mean?

327
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,260
You're doing something wrong.

328
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
How can you be a great weapon?

329
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Now, Mo Xiao is not even a demon for this phoenix snow.

330
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,260
He has escaped from the Sky Castle.

331
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,260
And there is a military uniform in the Chong Guang body.

332
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,260
It's connected to this phoenix snow.

333
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
As long as there is phoenix snow,

334
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
they will definitely use it as my own.

335
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Do you understand?

336
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Keep it.

337
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Take it away first.

338
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Didn't you know I moved from the Underland F ER?

339
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
I haven't moved on to the Underland F Forge yet.

340
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
But I think this is how I win.

341
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
I won't startle you.

342
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Hey.

343
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Let's go.

344
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Zhang Chuo's Chaos Sp наблюд Center.

345
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Recommend farming.

346
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
What's the secret hour?

347
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,260
divining food.

348
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Don't act anymore.

349
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,760
As the leader of Mount Zu,

350
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
you have harmed the disciples of the Immortal Sect,

351
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
and you have poisoned the senior of the Sect.

352
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
You also forced Feng Yue Sword to be silenced.

353
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Now, you are actually holding a sword.

354
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
You are not taking the letter of the Thousand and Autumn Cards.

355
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,260
Lei Lei's criminal army has already found out.

356
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,760
Today, we Immortal Sect's first-hand men

357
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,260
are here to witness the battle.

358
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,760
I, Xie Tian Jun, will personally suppress you back to Mount Zu.

359
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,260
I will take the sword of the Immortal Sect to apologize to you.

360
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,260
Xie Shili,

361
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Lei Lei's criminal army?

362
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,260
What are you talking about?

363
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,260
I have received the message.

364
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,260
Now, the Heavenly Demon Sect has made up their minds

365
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
to steal the news of the Thousand and Autumn Cards.

366
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,760
I, Mount Zu, am here to protect Feng Yin.

367
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Isn't this something that should be done as the leader of Mount Zu?

368
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,260
Why must we still have these disciples

369
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,760
in front of the Immortal Sect?

370
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
How can we be so rude to me?

371
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Cui Er!

372
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Ling Xiang, do you recognize this person?

373
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Tell everyone in front of the Immortal Sect

374
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,260
that you have been a hero for the past life.

375
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
Is it him?

376
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,260
Bu Rong Ce, what nonsense are you talking about?

377
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Are you going to teach others here to slander your father?

378
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Father, we had a brother and sister who had fought with you

379
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,560
when we went down the mountain.

380
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,060
You told me that you had already sent it to the Fu Shu family to collect the sheep.

381
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,760
After several years, I saw Ling Xiang and Long Wei and An Ying died.

382
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
How do you explain this matter?

383
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,760
What nonsense are you talking about? What nonsense?

384
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,960
Ling Xiang, don't you understand now?

385
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,760
He has been using you!

386
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Sister!

387
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Sister!

388
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,460
Sister!

389
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,560
Ming Er, you are Ming Er?

390
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Ming Er.

391
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,560
Sister.

392
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,060
Sister, the master said that he sent you to the Fu Shu family in the south.

393
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,260
Why are you here?

394
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,560
You didn't go to the north and the capital to participate in the war.

395
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
How could you come here?

396
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
It's you.

397
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,560
You are lying to us.

398
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,060
You have been telling me that he has been doing very well.

399
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,260
He has no worries and he has no worries.

400
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,460
That's why I am willing to be safe for you.

401
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,660
It turns out that you are just using us to protect and protect the family.

402
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,060
You treat us as your own son.

403
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,260
Without my knowledge,

404
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,060
you two can live to this day.

405
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,360
As a senior of Shushan,

406
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,760
you actually changed your position and did something wrong in Fengdu City.

407
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,160
You killed the disciples of the Immortal Sect.

408
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,360
You colluded with the Demon Sect.

409
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,560
You didn't deserve to be poisoned and killed the Sect Leader.

410
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,060
You are just a little bit more important.

411
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,960
You can even get you into the Iron Manor and enter the Fu Ma Palace.

412
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,560
Today, I will send the Sect Leader's order

413
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,360
to send the Immortal Sect's order to take out the Wurong Sect's Feng.

414
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,560
Shushan Sect's Sect Leader will immediately be under the arrest of Shushan.

415
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,560
Just like you two,

416
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,360
two filial pious people.

417
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,960
Tell you that Shushan is my Shushan.

418
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,160
Only I can hit this Immortal Sect.

419
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,960
You two...

420
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,760
can't move me.

421
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,360
Father, let's go back to the hair salon to save my brother and me.

422
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Miss!

423
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Let's go!

424
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,960
Mu Chang Feng, don't be obsessed with anything anymore.

425
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,560
Or else, you will blame me for not being able to read the same line.

426
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,360
Mu Chang Feng, don't be obsessed with anything anymore.

427
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,960
Sister!

428
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,560
Mu Chang Feng has already saved the Demon Valley. Everyone, let's go together!

429
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
You two...

430
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,160
Immortal Secret Demon Power?

431
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I never thought that Mu Rong Chang Feng has already entered the Demon Valley.

432
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,560
Sister!

433
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,760
Sister!

434
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,560
Sister!

435
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,360
Sister!

436
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Sister!

437
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Sister!

438
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,560
Mother!

439
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Mother!

440
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,560
Senior Sister Xian Zhen, Qing Yang and Qing Xu are brothers.

441
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,560
I didn't expect that Mu Rong Chang Feng has already trained

442
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,760
the Immortal Secret Demon Power that was originally from the Demon Valley.

443
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Then how should we deal with them next?

444
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,560
Mu Xiao, I misunderstood you before.

445
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,160
I'm sorry.

446
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Brother Mu Xiao.

447
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,160
Mu Xiao, you come here late.

448
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,960
We stopped him from staying and he was impregnated into the Mount Bu Zhou.

449
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,160
If there is any movement on Mount Bu Zhou,

450
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
the Demon Valley will be in chaos.

451
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,960
So, I ask you all to go back to your own sects first.

452
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,560
It's the first mountain. Leave it to me.

453
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,760
Jing Er and Ling Yun are on Mu Rong's side.

454
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,960
You two go to Mount Bu Zhou and continue to frame the Immortal Secret Demon Power.

455
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,760
I hope that Mu Rong Chang Feng will be able to help.

456
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,960
Mu Xiao, please let me help you.

457
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,360
We are all being forced to do so.

458
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,760
I, Feng Yue Jian Sun, am willing to do anything to help you.

459
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,560
I am willing to let you stay.

460
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,760
Today, the Immortal Sect is in trouble. I hope that you won't be too late.

461
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,360
I hope that you will be able to teach the Immortal Sect to protect the Immortal Sect.

462
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,360
If you are so loyal, we will entrust Mu Xiao to the Young Master.

463
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,160
You two don't need to be polite.

464
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,360
Protecting the Immortal Sect is a great favor to the Immortal Sect.

465
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
Mu Xiao is not a child of the Crown Prince.

466
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,560
But if there is any action on the Demon Sect's side...

467
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,960
Uncle, I will make another arrangement for this matter.

468
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,260
Sorry to bother so much.

469
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,360
I'm doing this work for you.

470
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,560
I hope we can do it together.

471
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,560
Jin Qing Sect looks like the dead of the Immortal Sect.

472
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,360
They went to beg for revenge.

473
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,960
We should find a new president.

474
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,960
to the Heavenly Demon School for our safety.

475
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Mo Xiao and Young Master Shao Hao, Feng Li Xue,

476
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
have been trying to stop the evil of Chong Guang.

477
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
They don't want to take down the Heavenly Demon Court

478
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
and destroy the Heavenly Demon Order.

479
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Mo Xiao knows that it's hard to see the Lord of the Heavenly Demon School.

480
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
He asked me to tell you all.

481
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Although the Heavenly Demon School doesn't have the order,

482
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
the people of Wan Qian School are still here.

483
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
In the future, it's better to be prepared for the future.

484
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
To protect our peace.

485
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
But please, everyone,

486
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
please keep your hands on the ground.

487
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Don't be used by others.

488
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Young Master, Mo Xiao

489
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
has seen Chong Guang

490
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
just want to borrow the power of the Heavenly Demon School

491
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
and the power of 100,000 Demon Army.

492
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
He asked Bu Zhou Shan to take the order.

493
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Now that I have regretted it,

494
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
he will definitely do the final battle.

495
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Bu Zhou Shan will take action.

496
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
But I, the Heavenly Demon School, will never be involved in this.

497
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Everyone,

498
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
please take your time.

499
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Since ancient times,

500
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
our Demon Clan has been

501
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
using the wild and fierce of the Lord of the Heavenly Demon School

502
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
to bring us the disaster.

503
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Today,

504
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Young Master, please be cautious of our teaching.

505
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
We should

506
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
take the blame for our own mistakes.

507
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
We should take it back.

508
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
We should take the responsibility for our own mistakes.

509
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
We should take the responsibility for our own mistakes.

510
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Since you two are so wise,

511
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,960
we can take the order.

512
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
We should take the responsibility for our own mistakes.

513
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Goodbye, teacher Lu.

514
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Goodbye Dream.

515
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Goodbye.

516
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,660
Okay,

517
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,780
thank you.

518
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,260
Teacher.

519
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,180
My lord.

520
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,060
After shooting disturbed me inılin Saya.

521
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,640
If you don't hurry up,

522
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,960
deducting the case is heaven's honor.

523
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,300
I agree.

524
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,300
I have no choice.

525
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,660
Thank you.

526
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,900
I can handle it.

527
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,700
Yakun.

528
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,260
I've already opened two of the three seal of the Three Seals of the Five Seals.

529
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,260
And this third seal needs your seal to be opened.

530
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,260
How about this?

531
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,260
You open the third seal for me.

532
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,260
I'll give you the seal that's completely damaged.

533
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Uncle Murong, once the seal is opened,

534
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,260
you won't have any retreats.

535
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
With the Cheneyman's help,

536
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,260
I can re-open the three seals.

537
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
I'll set the seal.

538
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Silly boy.

539
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
What do I need to retreat?

540
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,260
Brother Murong, save Li Xue.

541
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Ni Huang, you're the Cheneyman's Cheneyman.

542
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Once the seal is opened,

543
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,260
your body will be found by the three seals.

544
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,260
By then,

545
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,260
I'll never have the second seal.

546
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,260
I can protect you.

547
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
I promise you.

548
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,260
I'll open the seal now.

549
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Ling Yun and Murong are here to protect me.

550
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,260
The Cheneyman's Cheneyman

551
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
You're a fool.

552
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Get out of the way.

553
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,260
Uncle Murong, if you stop now,

554
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
the Cheneyman will only be re-opened

555
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,260
by the Cheneyman's help and the Cheneyman's help.

556
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
But if you insist on moving Cheneyman,

557
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
it'll be a disaster.

558
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260
With the three of you,

559
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,260
you three are still here to protect me?

560
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
You're not being polite.

561
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:51,780
My Adonai.

562
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,800
Father.

563
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,160
Suits you more no needed.

564
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,760
can I kill Jing'er and me?

565
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,680
Can I

566
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,840
let you down?

567
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,480
I'm your father.

568
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,080
I gave you both your life.

569
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,640
But now you're helping others

570
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,880
to deal with your father.

571
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,880
Okay.

572
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,920
Father.

573
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,160
From now on,

574
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,160
Jing'er and I

575
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,960
will take turns living with unease.

576
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,040
I don't have time forstage to kill and die with you!

577
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
Go!

578
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,600
Luo Xiao.

579
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,760
You will taste our ashes if you dare to come back here.

580
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,320
أن

581
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,760
Murong Changfeng!

582
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,000
How dare you行 against him?

583
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I will not give up

584
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Zhonggong

585
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You are finally here

586
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You have a good ambition

587
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and you are smart

588
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You know Changming is by my side

589
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You stole my long blood

590
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But you are still stupid

591
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You think you can get the money

592
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
if you practice my magical power?

593
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes

594
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
If you can balance my magical power

595
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You are not sure

596
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I am fine

597
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I have him in my hand

598
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Feng Lixue

599
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
He can not only hold on to Mo Xiao

600
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
but also treat you

601
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The Ice Manor in your body

602
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
is alive and dead together

603
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I am holding your life and death

604
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Ice Manor

605
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The Red Light has been in the Ice Manor

606
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It is because of the Ice Manor

607
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
If so

608
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
there is a Chonggong

609
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
who will not die

610
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Although you can live long

611
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
but you want to re-establish your body

612
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
you still need to live for hundreds of years

613
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
At that time, my magical power

614
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
will be the same as the Thousand Spears' Order

615
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I am the master of the Thousand Spears' Order

616
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You really make me angry

617
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Go

618
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Go

619
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Go

620
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Go

621
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Go

622
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Go

623
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Go

624
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Go

625
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The God's Order

626
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The God's Order

627
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
from the Demon King

628
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Will it be more powerful than the seal of the Thousand Spears' Order?

629
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

630
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm not afraid of you.

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000

I'm not afraid of you.

642
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

643
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

644
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
