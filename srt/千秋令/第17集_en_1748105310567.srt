1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Always have a wind, a fog, a wolf, a wind, a river

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling flowers, the flowing water, the rain, the flowers in the water

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If the dream is like you

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Always have a thousand years of life, no words, no breath

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The rain is falling, the tears are all gone

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain in another world

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Waiting for you

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you here?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why do you want to help me?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The book says that the man who is a gentleman should be in charge of the business.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The road is not smooth and the sword is not flat.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Help me with the sword.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I never thought that Su Yu is still in this life.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My house is not in the same place as Su Yu.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Today, I saved you again.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Two times the life.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Two times the life.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Two times the life.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How did you save me?

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You saved me again?

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How did you save me?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You saved me?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How did you save me?

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How did you save me?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You saved me?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When I was a child, I lived in the same house as you.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What do you mean?

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,920
I'm asking you once.

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,960
Two times.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160
How can I thank you?

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,880
The water is not clear,

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
and the water is not clear.

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,560
What?

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
You forgot your holy book so soon?

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm just kidding.

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,360
I think

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
you're different from them.

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,520
I want to be friends with you.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,680
Is that okay?

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,480
I'm afraid not.

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
You saved me twice.

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
It's my kindness.

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
Of course, kindness is more important than friends.

63
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
So,

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,200
you've made up your mind?

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,040
But you're going to stay here for seven days.

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,240
Won't you feel bored?

67
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,240
No, I'm not.

68
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,040
I have him.

69
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,560
Okay.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,040
I'll tell my master

71
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,080
it's not your fault.

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
Let him let you go.

73
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,400
No.

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't go.

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,400
Hey.

76
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,800
Master, he is looking for me.

77
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,660
Can you

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,800
explain everything?

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,260
Get something to talk about

80
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,040
and he was finally exposed as an imperial son.

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,720
That is not related to Yun dynasty.

82
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,080
My master, please let him go.

83
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,760
How dare you plead your affection for his sake?

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,420
Trying to spoil my feelings?

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Okay.

86
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,340
A complementary list

87
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,160
Oh?

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,260
Then why did she

89
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,680
make a slut out of you?

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,320
Have you been

91
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,480
in any contact with these two people?

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,980
His Majesty wasto gossip about you

93
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,800
and did not dare to hold a duel

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,760
against him.

95
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,540
Can you find your master

96
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,340
willing to believe you?

97
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,920
Of course.

98
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,840
I will return his queria.

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,920
Ok, 小天动也是 base with sand,

100
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,640
When the Tips will wait,

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,740
Nothing can change 🎹

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,040
You've been in the Chinesearring spots.

103
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,580
Why are your friends in the Western trouvé?

104
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,440
Obviously, they are in China.

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,660
Don't you need to change their condition?

106
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,440
How about this packed box?

107
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,840
Your father's heavenly treasure

108
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,800
is a treasure of the world.

109
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,160
It's a magic weapon.

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,240
Wu Yan's holy stone was also not enough

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
to be hidden by your father.

112
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Then you already knew

113
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,280
that Wu Yan's holy stone is in the heavenly treasure.

114
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
Of course I knew.

115
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,240
Otherwise, how could I send you

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,000
to open the heavenly treasure

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,080
and tell you?

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,320
Didn't you help my father's revenge?

119
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
At the beginning, I told Feng Mian Yu

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
to avenge him.

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,720
But he also said

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
that my master's plan

123
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,000
must be completed.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,160
Did you forget?

125
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,200
What's your master's plan?

126
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,200
The time has come.

127
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,200
Now you know

128
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,280
that it may not be a good thing for you.

129
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
Are you afraid that

130
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,280
I will betray you?

131
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
No.

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,000
We are one body.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,240
You have to believe in yourself.

134
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,640
You will never betray me.

135
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,360
Look at my eyes.

136
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,640
Ten years ago,

137
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,280
you looked at me like this.

138
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,360
This eye can draw a thousand years of ice and snow.

139
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,000
It can move the world to three realms.

140
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
It is him

141
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,880
who made us choose each other.

142
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Master.

143
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Tell me.

144
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
Mo Xiao has entered Chang Huan Palace.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
Our meeting is over.

146
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,600
Теперь

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
I didn't expect that

148
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
the famousiritual Makarated crispy man

149
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,200
just襲 put his full respect in front of all of us.

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,720
I am sure

151
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,000
he is a lucky person.

152
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,600
He became a afterwards

153
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,220
crown prince at such a young age.

154
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,600
He canDo.

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,000
A worthy one.

156
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,920
It is a pity that

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,080
he will never like new husband I have chosen.

158
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,440
He would do well

159
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,880
You and I are magic victims before the sun rises.

160
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,140
If you can be in the comets of the FOREED White Prof天 demonore

161
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,660
and join hands with us

162
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,160
then you can create a magical world.

163
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,420
I agree, I think if you are willing to peacefully..

164
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,740
Pshubha-Khalas,

165
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,780
lecheress order will come up to you.

166
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,660
By myoks and concubines, only listeners are from Japs.

167
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,420
Ye Lin's heart Brother Teng какое чего pour d' UX.

168
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,000
I've always thought that

169
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,340
him me too.

170
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,820
Great.

171
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,620
Draw it up

172
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,780
to에서

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,300
sec Clap

174
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,440
Not alcohol

175
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,240
...

176
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,860
...

177
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,380
to cure the poison.

178
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,100
That's right.

179
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,020
Since it's a deal,

180
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,100
what do you plan to exchange for?

181
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,340
I...

182
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,140
Mo Xiao insisted on not letting you stay with me.

183
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,420
Will something happen to her?

184
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,500
Shall we go and see?

185
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,980
She told us to wait for her in this yard

186
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,340
and not leave.

187
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,980
With my experience,

188
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,420
her warning must be heard in a word.

189
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,900
Otherwise...

190
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,180
What if?

191
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,420
Otherwise, the consequences will be very serious.

192
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,580
It's been another day.

193
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,780
Since their illness is going to be serious,

194
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,420
what will I do?

195
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,740
She won't exchange for herself.

196
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,620
You must have noticed

197
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,580
the数 at the very first time you gained An Lushun.

198
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,180
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,180
You can choose if you want.

200
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,300
It's fine.

201
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
It is good for you.

202
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,060
If you say so,

203
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
if that's the case,

204
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,060
it's all from my mother.

205
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:50,960
めて

206
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:14,120
Feng Yuan

207
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,680
Let's change the perspective.

208
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Compared to the scholars and the followers of Fengyuan Sword Sect,

209
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
who is more powerful?

210
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,600
Are you really sure that you want to use your own spiritual power

211
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,080
to feed my holy stone, the immortal spirit?

212
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,200
Then we'll see if Demon Lord can use this ability to devour me.

213
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,160
You think that you're so stubborn that I can't devour you?

214
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,360
Then we'll see what Demon Lord can do.

215
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Okay.

216
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
You've drunk this cup of wine.

217
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
Our deal has begun.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
After I drink this wine, I'll take the Demon Lord's punishment.

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But before I drink the wine, I still want to see the sincerity of Demon Lord.

220
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,400
You want me to let go of your copper door first.

221
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,520
But what if you regret it?

222
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,520
Demon Lord thinks that Mo Xiao is a person who is stubborn.

223
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,720
How about this?

224
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,360
I'll let go of the three disciples of Chang Huan Palace first.

225
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,920
I'll drink this wine.

226
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,960
When I'm at the limit for Demon Lord,

227
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,800
I'll let go of all the other demon people in the Aiyu Valley.

228
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Okay?

229
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Okay.

230
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
I promise you.

231
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Chang Ming.

232
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,400
Give her the antidote.

233
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
What?

234
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,120
Didn't you hear what I said?

235
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Yes.

236
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,520
Demon Lord has promised to do so.

237
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,120
Mo Xiao will not be able to turn back.

238
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
What are you doing?

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,920
I'm going to kill him when he's in the Divine Power of Immortality!

240
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Li Xuan.

241
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,960
Can we finally get together?

242
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,120
Master, what do you want to do with him?

243
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Just like the others in the city,

244
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
he was poisoned by love and hate.

245
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
But he didn't drink that wine.

246
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
The wine is not in the wine, but in the wine.

247
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
When he was drinking the wine and was on the edge of the river,

248
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,120
I was the one who was poisoned.

249
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Then what do you want to do with him?

250
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Master, you know that the one who wanted to kill him was me.

251
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,120
The perfect revenge is not a secret.

252
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,120
It is to make him fall from the clouds into the bottom of the lake.

253
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,120
To make him give up faith and give up dignity.

254
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
That's why I'm here.

255
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Until the end, he won't even want to kill himself.

256
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Why did you destroy him?

257
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,720
The Immortal Sect has been in chaos.

258
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,720
The sword and sword are all in the city.

259
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,720
If I can break into the Valley of Love today,

260
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
I will be the one to punish you.

261
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,020
You know what?

262
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,720
appelle

263
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:33,320
Son.

264
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,020
He is not capable.

265
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
and then it will be colored.

266
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Mo Xiao,

267
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
under the guise of love and hatred,

268
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
no matter how high she is,

269
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
she will not be surprised.

270
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Ordinary people

271
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
are obsessed with love and hatred for seven days.

272
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
When the god is gone,

273
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
they can be called the Immortal Soul.

274
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Mo Xiao is very generous.

275
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
She needs a few days.

276
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
It's hard to ignore her.

277
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,120
But she is Mo Xiao.

278
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I have this patience.

279
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

280
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

281
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

282
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

283
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

284
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

285
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

286
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

287
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

288
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

289
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

290
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

291
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

292
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

293
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
I am the Immortal Soul.

294
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Mo Xiao.

295
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
I have thoughtны.

296
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,820
Here.

297
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,820
You're here.

298
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,960
Go back to your room.

299
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,180
That's not right.

300
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm already busy.

301
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,220
Don't bother me.

302
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,600
Although your mom's insistence is quite heavy...

303
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,060
It's OK.

304
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,980
It's just that every single week...

305
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,940
An unknown man is waiting for us through this door.

306
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

307
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Don't mention it to his brother.

308
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,660
This guy was there.

309
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,460
He was very constant.

310
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,180
Did he find anything?

311
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,340
Nothing.

312
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,060
Wait for me.

313
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,020
What do you say?

314
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,380
Mo Xiao has been in there for so long.

315
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,100
He's not in the mood.

316
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,420
If something happens to him,

317
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,140
we can't just wait.

318
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,100
Why don't we tell my father

319
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,380
to discuss it with them?

320
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,980
How old is Mo Rong?

321
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,420
Why does he look like a kid?

322
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,740
He wants to tell us when he meets something.

323
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,940
You told him last time.

324
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,460
But my father and your father came here

325
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,620
to give Mo Xiao so much pressure.

326
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,980
He forced him to go to Changhuang Palace.

327
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,060
Such a big deal.

328
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,620
Even if I don't pass the message to the mountain,

329
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,100
the Fengyu Sect will get the news soon.

330
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,260
The sect leaders will know it sooner or later.

331
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,660
There are more ways to make a good choice.

332
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,540
With this skill,

333
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,620
we might have solved everything.

334
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,060
Isn't that too passive?

335
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,260
Your father suddenly sent a message to the sect leader.

336
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,860
Now everyone is so agitated.

337
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,780
He's trying to take all his hopes

338
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,940
to Mo Xiao.

339
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,060
Longtan and Hu Xue

340
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,700
can't let him go alone.

341
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,660
As the sect leader of Mount Shu,

342
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,340
isn't he his responsibility?

343
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,500
Do you think he loves to be the sect leader?

344
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,700
What do you mean?

345
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,220
He's a good man.

346
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,740
He's just a pitiful man.

347
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,340
The other sect of Mount Shu is very cold.

348
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,940
I've already tried to get him here.

349
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Including you,

350
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,580
Luofeng elf.

351
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,860
Qing может

352
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,440
her COL엔

353
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,160
Our Equation

354
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,640
is allowed

355
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,000
to live infront of our sect leaders.

356
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,420
At Zong's court,

357
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,040
we'll know the truth

358
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,420
of the people who sent them here.

359
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,080
Hurry!

360
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,900
muut compose

361
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,780
you there

362
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,040
stop

363
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,380
Give them the talisman.

364
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,180
Yes.

365
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Who are you?

366
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,420
Where are we?

367
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,620
This is the dungeon of Aiyu Valley.

368
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,100
Why are we here?

369
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,100
You got poisoned by Aiyu's spirit.

370
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,100
I just took the antidote for you.

371
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,020
You need to wake up.

372
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,020
If you don't want to die,

373
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,740
take your brother with you.

374
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,660
Senior.

375
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,340
Senior.

376
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,260
Where are we?

377
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,980
What?

378
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,780
You can't leave?

379
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,140
I can't.

380
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,180
You can't leave?

381
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,660
Then stay here.

382
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
And make the sacred stone a spirit.

383
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:24,940
You...

384
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,340
Senior.

385
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,020
Senior.

386
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,380
Go.

387
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,860
We are too dangerous to go into the dungeon.

388
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,860
I don't agree.

389
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,860
Then you go.

390
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,980
I'll go in alone.

391
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,740
I don't agree with you.

392
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,580
What do you mean?

393
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,180
You can go alone.

394
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,580
Why do you stop me?

395
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,740
Although I don't like you,

396
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,060
I can't take you for a risk

397
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,620
because of my friendship with you.

398
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,660
I don't need you to like me.

399
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,860
I can bear the consequences alone.

400
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,860
Murong.

401
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,660
Thank you.

402
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,260
Why are you here?

403
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,020
I didn't expect

404
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,780
that we can escape

405
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,020
after so many things.

406
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,500
I just want to ask you.

407
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,020
When we met,

408
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,620
who was with you?

409
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,140
I don't know who it was.

410
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,220
He gave us three antidotes.

411
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,940
He said he would take us out of the city.

412
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,420
He gave you the antidote

413
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,740
and the city?

414
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,820
Where are the antidotes?

415
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,780
The antidote was taken.

416
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,380
No?

417
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,100
I really don't have any.

418
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
They gave us the talisman.

419
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,460
We were taken out when we woke up.

420
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,660
You hid the antidote, didn't you?

421
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,860
Young Master Xie.

422
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,380
What are you talking about?

423
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,300
Who are you to take me to the dungeon?

424
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,660
Did they say

425
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,140
why they let you out?

426
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,980
No.

427
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,460
What?

428
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,020
Something's wrong?

429
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,380
Senior Brother Luo.

430
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Since you're alone,

431
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,740
you should leave the city.

432
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
My father and Xie Shu are waiting for you outside the city.

433
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,620
Tell them what you saw

434
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,900
in the Changhuang Palace.

435
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,060
Maybe

436
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,780
they can find a way.

437
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
Don't forget to tell them

438
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,780
that Mo Xiao is in the Changhuang Palace.

439
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,300
The three of you can get the antidote

440
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,420
by using his own antidote.

441
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,180
We'll wait until tomorrow.

442
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,900
If Mo Xiao hasn't come out,

443
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,700
we'll find a way to get in.

444
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,660
If anything goes wrong,

445
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,260
Murong Club will send you a signal.

446
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,660
You can come over and help.

447
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,540
I understand.

448
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,500
I'll report to the two uncles tonight

449
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,220
and then we'll start the investigation.

450
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,060
Master.

451
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,820
The two people who were with Mo Xiao

452
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
are the Young Master of Mount Zu.

453
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,180
The three people I just sent

454
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,340
came out of Changhuang Palace.

455
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,620
I heard one of them

456
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,940
calling the two of them Young Master.

457
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,500
The two of them were not in the right place.

458
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,900
After they left,

459
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,740
I followed them along the way.

460
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,020
They said

461
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,060
they were going to leave the city

462
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,420
and meet with the disciples of Mount Zu.

463
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,620
It sounds like

464
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,140
the first mistake of Mount Zu

465
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,180
is also here.

466
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,980
That's great.

467
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,780
It seems that the guests

468
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
are going to the door.

469
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,620
Master.

470
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,100
Do you still need the antidote?

471
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,100
As long as Mo Xiao is devoured,

472
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,740
he will be able to trigger his evil heart.

473
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,620
I don't care about

474
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,420
the other disasters.

475
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,820
The most important thing now

476
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,660
is to find the third piece of the holy stone.

477
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,580
As long as Mo Xiao is devoured by the master,

478
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,500
he can become your son.

479
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,140
I'm sorry for the long name.

480
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,620
Please show me your name.

481
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,260
This time,

482
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,700
we should be able to

483
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,340
handle the hands of Mount Zu.

484
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,740
The guests are going to the door.

485
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Of course, we should

486
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,420
take good care of them.

487
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,820
Ranked with newborn material,

488
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,060
put them into the grave,

489
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,380
and jump into the river after a long time.

490
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,700
King Zhang.

491
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,020
Remember what I told you

492
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,060
so far?

493
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,700
Forget it.

494
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,480
Since

495
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,720
we had ailiort.

496
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,960
strips of yam,

497
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,840
yam represented the countless

498
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,040
Yet,

499
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,660
after the ge toothpaste of the night,

500
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,580
After that grams Bonxy

501
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,180
in the mushrooms

502
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,180
I was born with a bad temper.

503
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,180
So I asked you to make him your lover.

504
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,180
You are the one who is the most beautiful.

505
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
You are the one who is the most beautiful.

506
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
From now on, Yin and Yang are the only two.

507
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
They are all together.

508
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,180
So you are the one who is the most beautiful.

509
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,180
Yu Yi, life is like a dream.

510
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,180
It's like a dream.

511
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,180
It's a touching story.

512
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,180
If I can be with you in this life,

513
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:35,180
I will entrust this life to you.

514
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Hu Xiao.

515
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:54,180
Hu Xiao, why do you so willing to promise me?

516
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,180
I knew all of this couldn't be written down.

517
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,180
But still, I wish I could trust you.

518
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,900
Sometimes I think

519
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,100
whether you are wrong

520
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,740
or I am wrong.

521
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,300
Why

522
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,300
do I have to trust you so easily?

523
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,900
I have been with you for so long

524
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,420
and I still don't understand the rules.

525
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,620
Master asked me to remind you

526
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,940
that the people of Mount Zu are now outside the city.

527
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,180
You have to speed up the poison

528
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,580
that is being absorbed by Mo Xiao.

529
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,140
By then,

530
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,580
the sect leader of Mount Zu was demonized by Master.

531
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,420
The disciples of Mount Zu

532
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,420
will be confused by the truth.

533
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,380
I don't need to remind you

534
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
how to do something.

535
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,060
Don't think that you are wrong.

536
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,620
Don't think that you are the sect leader of Mount Zu now

537
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,420
and you can do this.

538
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,940
He is poisoned.

539
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
Don't be close to him.

540
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,340
I don't like him.

541
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,820
He is poisoned

542
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,180
and he didn't do anything wrong.

543
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,060
Go back and tell Master

544
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,780
that he said that he is patient.

545
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Don't worry.

546
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
I am here.

547
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
No one will hurt you.

548
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660
I am here.

549
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,860
No one can kill you.

550
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,660
What did you say?

551
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,460
The sect leader went to Chang Huan Palace alone?

552
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,660
Yes.

553
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
A demoness

554
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,660
brought us three people to the dungeon today

555
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,060
to give us three antidotes.

556
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,660
She said that she will take us out of the city

557
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,460
and meet the sect leader of Murong

558
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,860
outside Chang Huan Palace.

559
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,060
Thank you, Young Master.

560
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
But...

561
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
What?

562
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,460
The demoness Feng Lixue is still in Chang Huan Palace.

563
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,660
Will the sect leader...

564
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,660
The Feng Lixue

565
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,060
is used by the demon lord Chong Guang.

566
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,460
It is indeed a threat to the sect leader.

567
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I think so.

568
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,260
Mo Xiao went to Chang Huan Palace

569
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,860
to save you.

570
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,060
She knows that Feng Lixue is a demoness.

571
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,860
She won't have any more information.

572
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Yes.

573
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,460
I hope that the sect leader

574
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,060
will recognize the demoness as the truth soon.

575
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,060
Don't be soft-hearted.

576
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
Since that is the case,

577
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,660
we will wait for the news from the sect leader.

578
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,460
If there is any wind and rain,

579
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,260
we will kill them in the city.

580
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
Yes.

581
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Look.

582
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
Wait for me.

583
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,460
I will be back soon.

584
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,660
This is your secret.

585
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,660
I will tell you the secret.

586
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,860
This is your favorite food.

587
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
I am hungry.

588
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
I should eat this.

589
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,460
Are you hungry?

590
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Mo Xiao.

591
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,060
Xing Li Yun.

592
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,660
Let's go.

593
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,660
What are you doing?

594
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,660
Come with me.

595
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
What happened?

596
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
You know it.

597
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,660
Let's go.

598
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
You are not even talking.

599
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,660
You know it.

600
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
Mo Xiao.

601
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,660
Is he in love with the capital?

602
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
No.

603
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,660
He is in love with the capital.

604
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
It must be a serious matter.

605
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,160
disparity of culture

606
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,760
Recently, the Prime Minister is also practicing martial arts.

607
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,820
We have to race to theとか

608
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,420
Especially, we must race to the taken сразу Kakausha.

609
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,460
Let Verona ist United.

610
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Is it okay?

611
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
To fight in the forest

612
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,860
The shi след is not enough.

613
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
Mo Xiao, he is the traitor of Xianmen.

614
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,620
And you, the demon girl,

615
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,500
even killed him with you.

616
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,620
His life is mine.

617
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,780
Except me, no one wants to do it.

618
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Li Xue, you can only look at me in the eyes.

619
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,940
Don't care about others.

620
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,780
Let's go.

621
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,220
Let's go for a drink.

622
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,540
Hey, don't leave.

623
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,020
Stop!

624
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,620
Yu Haoshi,

625
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,220
I asked you to wait outside the city.

626
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,340
Why did you suddenly break into the city?

627
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,900
Do you know that it will kill him?

628
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,260
What do you mean?

629
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,780
Wait patiently.

630
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,140
You will understand.

631
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,420
I will go to the city.

632
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,580
I will go to the city.

633
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,940
I will go to the city.

634
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,140
I will go to the city.

635
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,540
I will go to the city.

636
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,100
I will go to the city.

637
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,740
I will go to the city.

638
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,340
I will go to the city.

639
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,020
I will go to the city.

640
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,740
I will go to the city.

641
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,620
I will go to the city.

642
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,540
I will go to the city.

643
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,260
I will go to the city.

644
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,220
I will go to the city.

645
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,180
I will go to the city.

646
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,020
I will go to the city.

647
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,260
I will go to the city.

648
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,260
You are hurt.

649
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,740
I am not.

650
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,500
No, you are.

651
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,700
You actually hurt you.

652
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,700
He is just a pawn.

653
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,140
How can he hurt me?

654
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,980
He used to be.

655
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,700
But now,

656
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,100
you are actually falling in love with him.

657
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,500
Impossible!

658
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,700
Once you fall in love with Demon Lord,

659
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,100
you will surely get into trouble.

660
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,700
You will surely get into trouble.

661
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
You will surely get into trouble.

662
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,700
You will surely get into trouble.

663
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,700
You will surely get into trouble.

664
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Don't make yourself a victim.

665
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,700
I will never die.

666
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Impossible to any foolish human.

667
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Impossible!

668
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
They are getting more and more serious.

669
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,900
There is no time.

670
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,500
Mo Xiao Ye is poisoned.

671
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,100
He must be broken tonight.

672
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,700
Then I will inform my father that they are going to break the plan tonight.

673
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,100
Let them do their best to not seal the transmission.

674
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
The person who sent Lu Jian Chuan out

675
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
already knows that the disciple of Mount Zu is in the city.

676
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,700
If the transmission is found,

677
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,300
he will definitely expose it.

678
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,700
Then how do we inform them?

679
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,900
Junior Sister Yue Yao,

680
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,100
I wonder if we can trouble you to inform my father and Uncle Murong.

681
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
I will break the plan tonight.

682
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
Junior Sister Yue Yao,

683
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,100
we will take good care of Hao Tian.

684
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
He is very skilled.

685
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
His situation is similar to Jing Er's.

686
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
He is much better.

687
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
So you don't have to worry.

688
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,100
We will definitely do our best to save Hao Tian tonight.

689
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Then I will go.

690
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,260
Yi Xiao Zhen,

691
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,100
what sound is making?

692
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
оль

693
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,940
Ahmad

694
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,100
Leave.

695
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
What sound?

696
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Let's celebrate here.

697
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Cease the USB.

698
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
With that,

699
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,100
the message will give us a second or a third to save Xiao Chuan.

700
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,060
For this time,

701
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,100
we will enjoy the happier little happiness and joy tonight.

702
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,100
I hope you can rest in peace in the houses about it later.

703
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,780
Congratulations!

704
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,100
Miss Yan Who sent you here will unhappy if you miss her!

705
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
There is an important news.

706
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
I want to discuss with you.

707
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
What is it?

708
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Shushan is going to fight with Chonggong.

709
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
What do you mean?

710
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Chonggong has made many Shushan disciples in the Aiyu Valley.

711
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Even the Shao Sect's young masters are in the line.

712
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Even the Shao Sect's Mo Xiao

713
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,100
has also planted the love poison of Chonggong.

714
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,100
I heard that Shushan has two masters

715
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
who have Shushan disciples

716
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
and are living in the Aiyu Valley.

717
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
And this kind of thing.

718
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Don't you want to go to the Aiyu Valley to enjoy the hot weather?

719
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Even the Fengyue Sword Master's successor

720
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,100
has been in love with the love poison.

721
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Then Shushan's other disciples

722
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
are no longer his opponents.

723
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
I'm afraid that this kind of thing

724
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
is not very beautiful.

725
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
But the Master of the Aiyu Valley

726
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
is not...

727
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
I've been waiting for decades

728
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
to see a Shushan

729
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,100
who is now a member of the Yuanbei City

730
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,100
and a demon who is now a member of the Suyi Mountain.

731
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
I want to see

732
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
what kind of mouth he has.

733
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,100
I still can't let go of that past

734
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
20 years ago.

735
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,100
He is like me, angry with me.

736
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,100
How can I let go of this hatred?

737
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Xu Yan Xingzhu.

738
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Do you want to go with me?

739
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,100
Xu Yan Xingzhu.

740
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Now, Shushan

741
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
has no love and no hatred in his heart.

742
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
He has no regrets.

743
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
I'm afraid that you've found the wrong person.

744
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,100
You really want to bear this.

745
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
If you can't find your child in time,

746
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,100
you must be so sincere in the Aiyu Valley.

747
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Do you want to bear this?

748
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,100
I'm afraid that you've found the wrong person.

749
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
