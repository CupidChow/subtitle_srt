1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Always

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There is no miracle, no miracle, the waves are in the river

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The falling flowers are flowing, no water is no shadow

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The flowers of life are like dreams, like you

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no breath, no breath

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The history is not clear

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain of another life

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll wait for you in the future

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll wait for you

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No, this is not your fault

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is my fault

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The son of the Demon Lord is the original sin

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I know

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This truth may not be accepted for you

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But in these 18 years

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I really don't know you are in Shushan

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't say it again

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's not talk about this

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There is just one more important thing

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is what your master left for you

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I brought it for you

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How can my master give you what he left for me?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I also find it strange

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But this is sent by the chief of the Shushan White Grass Sect

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He said your master used his life to keep these two things

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He thinks that now in this world

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The only one who can trust you and protect you

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is me

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's why he left me

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll wait for you outside

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No need

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Since my master gave it to you

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Of course you don't need to avoid it

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's see

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Chief

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Chief

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Murucheng Feng wanted to kill you

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I did it for you

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But why didn't your master send you to him

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
To protect him and teach him to you?

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Cheng Shi

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I heard from the chief

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The chief of the Shushan White Grass Sect

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Has been killed by the double-eyelid wood

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Could this be...

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Master

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Master left the double-eyelid wood to Mo Xiao

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He wants to ask for something from Mo Xiao

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please tell me

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll go to the Shushan White Grass Sect

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
There's nothing above

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
There's nothing above

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,000
The tribute my master had made in 18 years

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is it true?

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Mo Xiao

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Master

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,800
What you see now is the past that Master used to experience.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
It was a battle of the Immortal Demon eight years ago.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,600
You fought Ye Yuan and Chong Guang to set up the Guzheng Mountain.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,600
The Thousand-Blessed Qiong Lin was almost opened by you.

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,200
Fortunately, Feng Yue Sword Master was able to reach the main gate in advance.

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,400
He stopped Ye Yuan.

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,200
The Thousand-Blessed Qiong Lin was already destroyed.

96
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,000
He was cast out by the Immortal Demon.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,600
Chong Guang was secretly taken away.

98
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,800
Then he became the Immortal Demon.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,600
Ye Yuan heard the cry of the children.

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,000
He felt that he was being followed by the Immortal Demon.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,400
He thought that he had lost one son.

102
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,000
At that time, the Heavenly Demon Order

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
was already being sealed by Feng Yue Sword Master.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,200
He was also being cast out by the Immortal Demon.

105
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
He was also being cast out by the Immortal Demon.

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,400
He was also being cast out by the Immortal Demon.

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
The Heavenly Demon Order was already sealed by Feng Yue Sword Master.

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
He was cast out by the three pieces of the Demon.

109
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Two pieces fell down to the Guzheng Mountain.

110
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Ye Yuan left the only piece of the Demon

111
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,000
that he loved.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He handed it to Chong Guang with the Heavenly Demon.

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
The Heavenly Master brought back the baby to Xuan Qing Garden.

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
He named it Mo Xiao.

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,600
He also named it Feng Yue Sword Master.

116
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,400
He said that he would protect Mo Xiao and manage the Mount Shu.

117
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,800
If the Demon Sect has any intention to stop the people

118
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,400
from being called by the Heavenly Order,

119
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,000
it will be Mo Xiao.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No matter what you do,

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
as long as you are in the heart of the world,

122
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,600
you are the most important disciple of the Heavenly Lord.

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:25,000
You are the one who protects Mount Shu and the world.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Master...

125
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Master...

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,400
Master...

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,400
Master...

128
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Master...

129
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,000
Mother, how is brother?

130
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,000
What are you doing in the room?

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You should have been in the room.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why are you not talking?

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Is he still not awake?

134
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
I'll call him.

135
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
No need.

136
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,200
Elder, let him rest.

137
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
No one should disturb him.

138
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,800
But Mother, is he willing to go back with us?

139
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
You...

140
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
Wait for his own decision.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Senior Master, he still hasn't given himself away.

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,900
But, Master,

143
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,400
he calls out Customers Greetings very seldom.

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
I am not a Demon Master!

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,380
you should return

146
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,780
to Ling Yuan and admit this crime.

147
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,300
With your regret made in for this life

148
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,480
your enemy is also dead.

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,140
If the Yi-mahемumu Empire continues on that way,

150
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
we'll be Writing to god like you as television station.

151
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,220
Mu Ling ergo

152
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,720
go take a look at the ban ending book.

153
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,600
Go take a look at the ban ending book.

154
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:06,540
Our

155
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,020
For you and your family,

156
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,740
we should find them out horsepower

157
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,500
to bring us results!

158
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Where have you been the day before this?

159
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Yes.

160
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,300
Senior Master.

161
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,780
What's wrong?

162
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,460
Miracle wine

163
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,060
was sent to Her Majesty.

164
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,180
We'll go back to Tian Mo want we will go back

165
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,240
I watch all the people

166
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,860

Elegant lady

168
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,460
Can you stay in tribe

169
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,900
So finally come back

170
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,580
Much grateful to everyone

171
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
I didn't go back to the way I was.

172
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Remember,

173
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,080
from now on,

174
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,080
Xu Yuan is innocent.

175
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,080
Mo Xiao has nothing to do with the female harem.

176
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,100
The female harem's family is happiness.

177
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,740
My dear,

178
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,580
forgiveness,

179
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,600
and forgiveness,

180
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,540
are all I gain from you.

181
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,600
you will have no chance to show your freakin' face...

182
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,960
at the event.

183
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,840
Could you wait enough?

184
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,260
More slowly, please.

185
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,840
More slowly, please.

186
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,320
Oh, stop.

187
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,400
Your feelings are too touching.

188
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
Boss.

189
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,240
Boss,

190
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Look, this girl is leaving without coming out to see her off.

191
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Be good.

192
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
I'm not being good.

193
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,240
My father has been living for the people of the tribe for the rest of his life.

194
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,240
In his life, there shouldn't have been any farewells.

195
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Go.

196
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:43,240
The

197
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
The

198
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
The

199
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
The

200
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Master, Xu Yuan Wushuang has found Mo Xiao and is taking her back to Suyun Mountain.

201
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
She has come back together?

202
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Yes.

203
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Xu Yuan Wushuang has sent a secret message to Qi Dong Jiuyou.

204
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
He is known as Ye Yuan's son and has returned to Tian Mo Sect.

205
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,240
He wants to let Qi Dong Jiuyou and his elders come to Suyun Mountain to visit him.

206
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I'm happy to see my mother return home.

207
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I should be more loyal to her.

208
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Don't worry, Master.

209
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,240
The elders of Qi Dong Jiuyou have already said that they won't go.

210
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
No.

211
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Tell them that they will go.

212
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I will go too.

213
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
You are going to go there personally?

214
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,240
And our Honorable Empress.

215
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,240
To welcome our Young Master, we must make a good fortune.

216
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Master.

217
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Come in.

218
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Come in.

219
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Come in.

220
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Come in.

221
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Master, there's a message.

222
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,680
I'll take you back to Mount Suyu and make sure you're not caught by fire.

223
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,840
I order you to start the fire with a leader.

224
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,720
Don't let the leader go down the mountain.

225
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,320
Let the leaders go down the mountain?

226
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
What?

227
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,560
Do you want me to send a message personally?

228
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,880
But Changming Guard just told me

229
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,640
that we should guard the four leaders here.

230
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,280
We can't contact them in three days.

231
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,040
Why do you want to wake up the leader?

232
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,440
How can I decide?

233
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,840
Do I have to tell you?

234
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,520
No.

235
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,560
Let the four leaders organize the coffin.

236
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,200
I'll go back and report to the leader.

237
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Yes.

238
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,800
I've told you to do it.

239
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Let me go.

240
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
I won't tell anyone.

241
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,760
Communications Tax

242
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,720
Thank you for creating similar event.

243
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,880
Big brother Ye YuanẶe needs something.

244
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,080
He ventilated our accommodation list for his son.

245
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:22,160
We don't lackmod acquire

246
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,480
anyway.

247
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,280
Tomorrow, on the ancestral hall,

248
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,480
we must hold a grand memorial ceremony

249
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,680
for our Young Master.

250
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,200
Young Master is back.

251
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,160
He is the leader of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

252
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,560
He deserves to be congratulated.

253
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,360
Then thank you for your kindness.

254
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,000
You are the one who is my sect leader.

255
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,960
I can't give up Su Yu Mountain.

256
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,020
Hold her.

257
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,600
Come on.

258
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,440
Thanks

259
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,520
Boss, we need...

260
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,920
Wu, stop!

261
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,920
Little thing is I'm on Zhang chamber.

262
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,500
What are you doing?

263
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,480
It's my duty to take over Zhang palace.

264
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,680
Don't have to do that.

265
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This place belongs to me.

266
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
You are a traitor from the Fengyue Sword.

267
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
You are not the son of the Demon Lord.

268
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,840
Mu'er.

269
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,400
Mu'er.

270
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,200
This sword belongs to me.

271
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
But there's no meaning to it.

272
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,900
It fits the life put into action.

273
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,880
So happy to find you.

274
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
The mother is alive.

275
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,360
We don't need to replace her.

276
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,860
We are the one trying to serve you,

277
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,360
your Mansion.

278
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,500
What about Chenine Palace?

279
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Mo Xiao is tired. You all leave first and let her rest.

280
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Yes.

281
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Mo Xiao, I left your room in the hotel.

282
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
I'll clean it up and give you a hard time.

283
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I'll take you to rest now.

284
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Let's go.

285
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
You're awake?

286
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Yes.

287
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
You're lying to me?

288
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Yes.

289
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
When did your puppet curse be removed?

290
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
When I saved Mo Xiao,

291
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
the wind blade of Mo Xiao

292
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
was removed from my puppet curse.

293
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Mo Xiao.

294
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
You know Mo Xiao went to the female puppet clan.

295
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
You disappeared for half a day

296
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
and went to the water river, right?

297
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Yes.

298
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
You're worried that the people in Mount Zu will hurt him.

299
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,420
The four leaders of the Seven-Demon

300
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
and Nine-Demon Sect

301
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
were also you who set the mountain.

302
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
You let them stop Mo Xiao and go to Mount Zu.

303
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Right?

304
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Yes.

305
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Why didn't you tell me

306
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
that you were going to lie to me?

307
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
With the puppet curse,

308
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,500
you wouldn't have let me down.

309
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
But now,

310
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
there's a fact that you're not going to fight.

311
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
You're already my granddaughter.

312
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Your honor, you and I got married

313
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
just to show up for Mo Xiao.

314
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,500
I've never promised to be your granddaughter.

315
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,500
And all of this is just a ritual.

316
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,500
It can't change anything.

317
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Mo Xiao.

318
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
When you're not around,

319
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
you always keep on keeping your clothes on.

320
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
I imagine that you're now as old and slim

321
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,500
and you're getting thinner.

322
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I saw you today.

323
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
I found that you're wearing your clothes

324
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
just as good as your figure.

325
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I'm not sure if you can see it.

326
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

327
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

328
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

329
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

330
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

331
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

332
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

333
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

334
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Tell me,

335
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
you really got close to your mother?

336
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,500
You called me Young Master.

337
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
But let me ask you,

338
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,500
who in this world really is your master?

339
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
What kind of person are you?

340
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,460
Three days later

341
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:30,460
Theorar temporarily

342
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,700
Although I haven't been able to touch it, the wind has already blown.

343
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,900
Today, we will wait for the Qi Ju Shushan to attack the gate of Murong.

344
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,740
We will officially recognize the position of the Shushan Sect.

345
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,540
I've always been aсяmmpre Vlad...

346
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,420
...in service of theurenuls...

347
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:24,080
...to provide

348
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,040
security trust.

349
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,380
Let's disagree

350
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,500
on the飯 and Nacional Day together.

351
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,220
Tomorrow,

352
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,020
after Ita shadow ап費米

353
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,280
and follow Sun settled

354
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:53,860
theAng BIO

355
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Ling Yun, I know why you still can't do it.

356
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Are you disappointed?

357
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,080
You disappointed Mo Xiao, you disappointed Shi Bo,

358
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
you disappointed yourself.

359
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,080
We were so good, so ugly and full of quality.

360
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,080
We took down the future of Mount Zu together.

361
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,080
Protecting the people of the world, protecting the peace of the world.

362
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,080
But suddenly, everything has been destroyed.

363
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Everything has changed.

364
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,080
I believe that some people have changed.

365
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,080
If their hearts don't change, they can still find it back.

366
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,080
And some people have changed.

367
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,080
If they change, they can never find it back.

368
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,080
Ling Yun, I will find the person who can't change.

369
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,080
When I come back, you will wake up.

370
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,080
When I come back, you will wake up.

371
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Brother, can you help me take care of Ling Yun?

372
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,080
I will help you take care of her. Where are you going?

373
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
I am leaving Mount Zu.

374
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,080
Qing, I know that many things have happened recently.

375
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,080
You can't accept it.

376
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
But look at the situation of Mount Zu.

377
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Father just sent the position of the gatekeeper and the commanding officer.

378
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,080
It is time for us to go.

379
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
It is time for us to go.

380
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,080
You have grown up. You should learn to share your worries with father.

381
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Don't be ridiculous. Go back with brother, okay?

382
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
I won't help him.

383
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,080
The things he wants will only make me more envious.

384
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Why are you so upset about father?

385
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
What's wrong with you recently?

386
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Why don't you just smile and laugh?

387
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Even the gatekeeper is very less.

388
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
It's more important for father to avoid seeing him.

389
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
Why is that?

390
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Brother, do you believe in father so much?

391
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
You are right.

392
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
He is father and I am son.

393
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
Of course I trust him.

394
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:24,080
If one day you find out that he lied to you and lied to everyone,

395
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,080
do you still need to trust him and help him?

396
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Do you know what he is?

397
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Nothing.

398
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,080
It's just that the current Shushan is no longer the previous Shushan.

399
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Mo Xiao is a devil.

400
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
He is in a coma.

401
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
Uncle is gone.

402
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
The gate is closed.

403
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
The heaven is far away.

404
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Shushan has no more happy and happy effects from before.

405
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Life is like this.

406
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
In the process of growing up,

407
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
you will always be in this loss.

408
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
No.

409
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Some things will not be lost.

410
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
I will go find him.

411
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Jin'er.

412
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Brother.

413
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Take care of Lingyun for me.

414
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,080
When I find the answer, I will come back.

415
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Master.

416
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
It's all my fault.

417
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,080
I told you the truth about Master Chongguang.

418
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Master asked me to come here.

419
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
But I think he is not happy.

420
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
He came back from the fairy gate.

421
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
He is not happy.

422
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
I think he is happy.

423
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
I think he is happy.

424
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
I think he is happy.

425
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I think he is happy.

426
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
He came back from the fairy gate.

427
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Now he needs to accept everything here.

428
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,080
He really needs time.

429
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Just stay with him.

430
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
Master.

431
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Master.

432
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Young Master Hao is here.

433
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
What brings you here?

434
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Princess Xueyan.

435
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Mu Xiao.

436
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Is he all right?

437
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
What I asked is

438
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Young Master.

439
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Yes.

440
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Yes.

441
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
He is very good.

442
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
I think you can see it.

443
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
He is the Young Master of the Demon Clan.

444
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
He is so beautiful.

445
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
He should have what he wants.

446
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
I will give him everything I want.

447
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
I won't bother you.

448
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Yes.

449
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
You are his mother.

450
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Of course, you will give him everything.

451
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,080
But he grew up in the fairy gate.

452
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,080
He needs to accept education.

453
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
I am afraid he can't accept it.

454
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
You want to replace him.

455
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
You come to care for him.

456
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,080
I haven't come to visit you.

457
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
But I have a question.

458
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
I want to ask you.

459
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
The fairy gate and the master are brothers.

460
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Do you think that

461
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
Mu Xiao should be a late-night-teacher?

462
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
But I just arrived at Suyu Mountain.

463
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,080
I don't know much about the etiquette and rules.

464
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Moreover,

465
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,080
the Demon Clan in Suyu Mountain is so important.

466
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,080
How can I learn these rules with my experience?

467
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,080
I can't be so close to the Demon Clan.

468
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
Please take care of me.

469
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
I am sorry.

470
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
Son, you are right.

471
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,080
Now that Feng Li Xue is the son of Chong Guang,

472
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
you can't be together.

473
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,080
I am tired.

474
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
Master,

475
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Young Master just came back.

476
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
He must have some business to do.

477
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,080
He will be fine after a few days.

478
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I didn't take good care of him.

479
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
But it's okay.

480
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
As long as he comes back,

481
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
it's good.

482
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,080
Master.

483
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Master.

484
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,080
Master.

485
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
Master.

486
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
Master.
