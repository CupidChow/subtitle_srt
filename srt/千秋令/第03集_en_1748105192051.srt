1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the waves are in harmony

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling flowers are flowing and the water is not shadow

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers in the past

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As if in a dream, as if in you

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment and thousands of years

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The history is not clear

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain in another world

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Waiting for you

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Princess Xu

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why is Princess Xu?

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Princess Xu

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You made me disappear forever

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In this world

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yi Huang

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm right

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Men are all over the moon

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's true

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was wrong

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You made me fall in love with the old man for the third time

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yi Huang

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will destroy the third time

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yi Huang

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You need to pay for your debt

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yi Huang

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yi Huang

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm serious

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think now

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have not thought of your guarantee

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't hear this

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Send이� serve

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
See

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This spirit is really extraordinary.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
With the power of the Thousand Spell, you can turn the world around.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can die in the end.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can have the third world.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The power of the Thousand Spell

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
can be used to deal with the three realms.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I will get you right away.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The Thousand Spell

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The Thousand Spell

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The Thousand Spell

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Thousand Spell

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The Thousand Spell

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The Thousand Spell

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Thousand Spell

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Thousand Spell

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The Thousand Spell

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The Thousand Spell

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The Thousand Spell

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The Thousand Spell

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the Thousand Spell

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The Thousand Spell

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The Thousand Spell

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,960
Qiáchai

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
my father,

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,920
Fire!

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why don't you take it?

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The heaven has been blessed with the cause.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I didn't expect that I would be able to get the cause after ten thousand years of cultivation.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But I didn't lie to you.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I will do what you promised me.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What is it?

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What is it?

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I will use the Dragon Bead to play your magical power.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Take off the elixir and become a human.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No one can find you after this.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Take out the elixir.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000

I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,200

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will take you to the Dragon Bead.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you can't open the gate,

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I hope Вид a drop in hydrangea,

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and build theißist spring up.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The world is so beautiful.

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:24,000
In this endless life, endless death, endless heart, endless love, endless past, endless future,

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I will return to the past.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The Heavenly Lord has sealed the Heaven Realm's God of War for thousands of years.

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Now that the God of War is gone, the Heavenly Lord has sealed the back of the world.

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The Heavenly Lord has ordered that from now on, the Heavenly Lord will seal the Mount Buzhou and the Wujiji Garden.

142
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He will guard the Immortal Sect of Mount Shu.

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The Heavenly Lord has sealed the Wujiji Garden.

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The Heavenly Lord has sealed the Wujiji Garden.

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The Heavenly Lord has sealed the Wujiji Garden.

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The Heavenly Lord has sealed the Wujiji Garden.

147
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The Heavenly Lord has sealed the Wujiji Garden.

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Who are you?

149
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The Heavenly Lord of the Heavenly Demon Tribe, Ye Yuan.

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Who am I?

151
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You are the God of Nine Heavens.

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
A thousand years ago, the Heavenly Realm fought in another war in the Heavenly Realm.

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I was killed by three arrows.

154
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You were punished and beaten into an arrowless world.

155
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You were heartless and had to go to the real world to escape.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I fell into the Mount Suyu.

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This must be my fate.

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The Heavenly Demon Tribe died several thousand years ago because of the change of the Heavenly Lord of the Heavenly Autumn.

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They were expelled from the Mountain Suyu by the Heavenly Realm.

160
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Now, I have used the Holy Demon Bead to restore your body.

161
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have repaired your power just to let you know.

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have no hope for these thousands of years.

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can't forget it.

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
From now on, you will be the guardian of the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You will be the guardian of the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

166
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The guardian of the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The guardian of the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This name sounds good.

169
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
May you be reborn today and meet the God of Light again.

170
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The Heavenly Demon Tribe.

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The Heavenly Demon Tribe.

172
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,640
Go.

173
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm not doing this for me.

174
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
It's for us.

175
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If we have a day to work together,

176
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,800
we can turn the world around and be together.

177
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,200
Are you willing to do that?

178
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,400
Although I don't have the memory of the heavens,

179
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,800
I should repay the grudge of the soul.

180
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Good.

181
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,600
We can be together for the whole nine days.

182
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,400
We can be together for three more days.

183
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,800
It sounds good.

184
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,000
But if we have to be together for nine days,

185
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,200
we still need to do something.

186
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
Good.

187
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
You seem to be the best.

188
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
One customs first.

189
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
Cheng Yi's letter.

190
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
Right?

191
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,000
The letter has been sealed in Mount Wuzhou.

192
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The wind and the arrow are weak these years.

193
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Shu Shan wants to re-wind the arrow and sign the order.

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And gradually, Shu Shan, the arrow and the arrow are closed.

195
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So,

196
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I got the chance to be a man who is in the south.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have been waiting for a long time.

198
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are you waiting for?

199
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The left guard is the emperor.

200
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The right guard is the butcher.

201
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The Dark Soul Master, Ji Xing Luo.

202
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The seven-legged nine-legged.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Four great masters.

204
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Greetings, Master.

205
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I want to set up a big lake on the top of the left guard

206
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
to help me to be a great demon.

207
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Chonggong, come out and greet everyone.

208
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Who is this person? Where did he come from?

209
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
From now on, Chonggong is the great demon.

210
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He is the only one I respect.

211
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You all are the masters.

212
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Seeing the protection is like seeing the master.

213
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And you all are the ones who are too quick to see the protection.

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why?

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't you understand what I am saying?

216
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Greetings, Master.

217
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Chonggong is the great demon.

218
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Chonggong is the god of the heavens.

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He came to my Demon Clan and died in the end.

220
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
My Demon Clan was sent to the heavens to be a great demon.

221
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He has been retreating to the Mount Suyu for thousands of years.

222
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Now, he has the protection of Chonggong.

223
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He is like the tiger and the heaven.

224
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
As long as we can get the order from the thousand-year-old,

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I will definitely meet the gods of the Demon Clan.

226
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Master, the prefectural commander has a new sect.

227
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He is in the Wujiji Garden.

228
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If we get the order, we will officially fight with Mount Suyu.

229
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I have been a great warrior for years.

230
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It is hard to win against Mount Suyu.

231
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Master, I am not afraid to leave.

232
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It is just that the order from the thousand-year-old is very important.

233
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Please think twice before you leave.

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It seems that everyone has been fighting for a long time.

235
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They are all exhausted from fighting.

236
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If my Demon Lord is being attacked,

237
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I am sure that Mount Suyu will be in a bad mood.

238
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's right.

239
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We just have to kill him.

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We will not fight against him.

241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Mount Suyu.

242
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It has been thousands of years since we got trapped.

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We will never have such a day.

244
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Today, as long as you follow me,

245
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
we will kill the king together and not leave the mountain.

246
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We will get the order from the thousand-year-old.

247
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I wish the Demon Clan to rise up and fight against the three realms.

248
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We will fight against the three realms.

249
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We will fight against the three realms.

250
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We will fight against the three realms.

251
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We will fight against the three realms.

252
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We will fight against the three realms.

253
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No.

254
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Madam.

255
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Master.

256
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You are pregnant and have no rest in the palace.

257
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why are you here?

258
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You have to go to Buzhou Mountain.

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Madam, you are about to leave.

260
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't worry about it.

261
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Anxin will wait for us in the palace.

262
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Wait for our son to be born.

263
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I want him to see

264
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
the great light of the three realms of the Demon Clan.

265
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
When I start the fight,

266
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I will give you and your son a big gift.

267
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Master.

268
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Master.

269
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The Demon Clan will rise up and fight against the three realms.

270
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Master.

271
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Master.

272
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Master.

273
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
�

274
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,160
Excellent.

275
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,120
imasin

276
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,000
I stop him

277
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
You take over the Lateral message

278
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
свободém

279
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,720
and go back to the world?

280
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,800
Who?

281
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,000
Who always dream is the dream?

282
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,700
喪车,少年仑ゴ

283
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,240
My brave son is about to obtain the throne.

284
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,440
But you still haven't noticed it.

285
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,780
You look at him.

286
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,280
Xiao Yu.

287
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,520
It could Lieutenant Yang be...

288
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,360
in a decision sooner or later?

289
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,680
Yes.

290
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,200
Yes.

291
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,120
Next time...

292
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Chief!

293
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,860
I need to get rid of him.

294
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,540
I'm not scared of him.

295
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,620
You might not follow him back at all.

296
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,260
It'd better not this time.

297
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,780
But after that,

298
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,620
he'd be able to meet his people.

299
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,140
That's not enough.

300
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,560
We'll take it apart.

301
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,460
It's OK.

302
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,060
You must go now.

303
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,400
Your Majesty.

304
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,540
Your Majesty.

305
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,340
Master.

306
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
Master.

307
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,060
Dai Lan Yu.

308
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,860
Master.

309
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,340
Master.

310
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,500
Master.

311
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,300
Go.

312
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Master.

313
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
Master.

314
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
Master.

315
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
Master.

316
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
Master.

317
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
Master.

318
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Master.

319
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Master.

320
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Master.

321
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
Master.

322
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
Master.

323
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Master.

324
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Master.

325
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
Master.

326
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,540
Master.

327
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
Master.

328
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Master.

329
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
Master.

330
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
Master.

331
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
Master.

332
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Master.

333
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Master.

334
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
Master.

335
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Master.

336
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Master.

337
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Master.

338
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
Master.

339
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
Master.

340
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
Master.

341
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540
Master.

342
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,540
Do you know the way to Mount An?

343
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
Master.

344
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,540
Do you know the way to Mount An?

345
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
Who are you?

346
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,540
So you know how to talk.

347
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,540
I was at the dance class. I couldn't be interrupted.

348
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,540
So you're using your sword to hurt me?

349
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,540
I just want you to interrupt me.

350
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Besides, you're the one who started it.

351
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,540
I just want to ask you a question.

352
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,540
You won't answer it.

353
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,540
That's why I want to use my phoenix chain to draw you.

354
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,540
I asked Wu Hua and he left.

355
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,540
What's wrong with interrupting?

356
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,540
You're so serious about this.

357
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Master said that I have to attend the class.

358
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
I have to attend the class.

359
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,540
It's the same for everyone.

360
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,540
So you're a fool.

361
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
Who are you?

362
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
What do you want to know?

363
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,540
You don't have to care about me.

364
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
I just want to go up the mountain.

365
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Do you know where there's a way to go up the mountain?

366
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,540
There's no way to go up the mountain.

367
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,540
How did you get there?

368
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,540
I climbed up the mountain.

369
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
What do you want to do when you go up the mountain?

370
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,540
My father fought with someone in the phoenix chain.

371
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
It's been three days and nights.

372
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,540
I'm worried.

373
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
I want to go and see.

374
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,540
My master also said that he fought with someone in the phoenix chain.

375
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
That person is your father.

376
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,540
The one who fought with my father is your master.

377
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,540
Master Feng used to practice the phoenix chain in the late sect.

378
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,540
You should know that the three realms of the phoenix chain

379
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,540
are not more than normal.

380
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Even if you win today,

381
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,540
thousands of disciples from the late sect will guard the phoenix chain.

382
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,540
Feng Yue, we were practicing the phoenix chain in the late sect.

383
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
My master clearly won with you.

384
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,540
But Master passed the phoenix chain to you.

385
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,540
He even asked me to protect the phoenix chain.

386
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
I didn't ask for the order.

387
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Now my master has practiced the phoenix chain.

388
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,540
Although my master has already passed the phoenix chain,

389
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
I believe that he will see

390
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,540
how big the mistake he made.

391
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,540
You were so heartless.

392
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,540
You didn't break the phoenix chain.

393
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
You didn't even break the phoenix chain.

394
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
You were disappointed in your master.

395
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,540
That's why you used the phoenix chain.

396
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,540
I didn't expect that you were so heartless.

397
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
You even blamed the Immortal Sect for being ungrateful.

398
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,540
If the phoenix chain is in your hands,

399
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,540
you will be the best in the world.

400
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,540
Then let's see who will win today.

401
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Ji Yuan.

402
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,540
You are the one who fought with my master and my father.

403
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,540
Why don't we go to the mountain to watch the battle together?

404
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
No.

405
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,540
Master told me to wait for him in the temple.

406
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,540
You are so stupid.

407
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
You are so obedient.

408
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
Let me ask you.

409
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,540
If you make a mistake,

410
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,540
will your master punish you?

411
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
He won't punish you.

412
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
What are you afraid of?

413
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
He won't punish me.

414
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,540
I didn't make a mistake.

415
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
What a pity.

416
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,540
There are mistakes in the sky and the moon.

417
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
You didn't even make a mistake.

418
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,540
You only know half of the world.

419
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
Even if you make a mistake here,

420
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,540
you won't be punished.

421
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,540
Forget it.

422
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
Wait here.

423
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
I will go by myself.

424
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
There is no road on the mountain.

425
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
How can you go there?

426
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,540
I am afraid that I will be punished.

427
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
Go there right now.

428
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
He is in danger.

429
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,540
You can go.

430
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
I have made up my mind.

431
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
You have a life today.

432
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
After I leave,

433
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,540
you must be careful and stay in the temple.

434
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,540
36 guests are coming.

435
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,540
You must not go out of the temple.

436
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,540
This is a fate.

437
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,540
Maybe you can live safely.

438
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Go.

439
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
Go.

440
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
Give me your hand.

441
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Give it to me.

442
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Go.

443
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
Your hand.

444
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
Let go of me.

445
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,540
You can't save me.

446
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Let go of me.

447
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,540
I will let you go.

448
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,540
You will die if you let go.

449
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
No.

450
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
I will save you.

451
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Hold on.

452
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,540
Hold on.

453
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,540
You just pulled my hand.

454
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
I will die if I don't pull you.

455
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
You will die.

456
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,540
Are you okay?

457
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
I am fine.

458
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Don't worry.

459
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
Are you not cold?

460
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
Cold?

461
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Why am I cold when the sun is out?

462
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
It's weird.

463
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,540
Something is wrong with me.

464
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
I am so cold.

465
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,540
I am so cold.

466
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
I am cold.

467
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I am so cold.

468
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
I am so cold.

469
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
I am cold.

470
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
You know me?

471
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
I have seen in the medical books

472
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,540
that the cold in the white jade is less cold.

473
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
It is better to drink water than to get into the fire.

474
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,540
It is so precious to me.

475
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
You are born in the heaven.

476
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,540
No one can enter my body.

477
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
The cold in the jade is not good.

478
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540
But if you drink water

479
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
and drink hot water,

480
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
you will be cured.

481
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
You are so cold.

482
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,540
I am so cold.

483
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
I am so cold.

484
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
I am cold.

485
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,540
I am cold.

486
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
I am cold.

487
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
I am cold.

488
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
I am cold.

489
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
I am cold.

490
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
I am so cold.

491
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,540
I am cold.

492
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,540
Can I hold your hand again?

493
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
You are so amazing.

494
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,540
You are the first person

495
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
who is not afraid of me.

496
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Can you be my good friend?

497
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
You are the only person

498
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
who is not afraid of me.

499
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
You can be my only good friend.

500
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,540
What is good friend?

501
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
My father said

502
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,540
good friend is to live together and die together.

503
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,540
I won't let you die.

504
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
I will protect you.

505
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,540
You promised?

506
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
You even have a heart of compassion for Chu.

507
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
My teacher said

508
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
we should protect

509
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
the kind person

510
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,540
who has compassion for compassion.

511
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,540
No.

512
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Because I am your good friend.

513
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Then how do you protect me?

514
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
I will send you to the mountain.

515
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
Aren't you afraid of making mistakes?

516
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
In my opinion,

517
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
it is the mistake

518
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,540
to risk your life to die.

519
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,540
I will do what I think is right.

520
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
Teacher,

521
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
you are so smart

522
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
when you are looking at me.

523
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,540
My name is Mo Xiao.

524
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,540
I am not a teacher.

525
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
My name is Feng Lixue.

526
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
Mo Xiao,

527
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,540
how do you send me to the mountain?

528
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
I will send you to the mountain.

529
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
The wind blows, the stars and the river

530
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,540
are so lonely and sad.

531
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,540
The mountains and rivers are falling,

532
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
the rain and the rain are falling.

533
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,540
The food is cold, the body is cold,

534
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,540
the waist is burning.

535
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,540
The sky is dark, the clothes are wet.

536
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
The scenery is so clear,

537
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,540
the world is so noisy and the people are so noisy.

538
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,540
The food is cold, the body is cold,

539
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,540
the waist is burning.

540
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,540
Love is hard to love,

541
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,540
the courage is hard to hide.

542
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,540
The food is cold, the body is cold,

543
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,540
the heart is not willing to wake up.

544
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,540
The moon is in the air,

545
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,540
the city is waiting for the sea.

546
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,540
I'm not afraid of you.

547
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,540
I'm not afraid of you.

548
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,540
I'm not afraid of you.

549
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,540
I'm not afraid of you.

550
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,540
I'm not afraid of you.

551
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,540
I'm not afraid of you.

552
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,540
I'm not afraid of you.

553
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,540
I'm not afraid of you.

554
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,540
I'm not afraid of you.

555
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,540
I'm not afraid of you.

556
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
I'm not afraid of you.

557
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,540
I'm not afraid of you.

558
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
I'm not afraid of you.

559
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,540
I'm not afraid of you.

560
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,540
