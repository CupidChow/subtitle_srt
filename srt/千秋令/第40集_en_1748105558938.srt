1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The rain can't change the time

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There is a deep regret in my heart

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The moon in the water, the moon in the earth, it can't be changed

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Always the wind blows, the fog rises, the waves rise, the wind blows, the river flows

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The falling flowers, the flowing water, the rain, the flowers in the rain

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Like a dream, like you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Always the wind blows, the fog rises, the waves rise, the river flows

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The history is all gone

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The rain in the other world, the snow in the house, it's you

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's you

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's go help Brother Mo Xiao.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Mo Xiao, let's help you.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 1

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Episode 1

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Episode 1

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Episode 1

19
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not that you are the only one who secretly practiced my magic power

20
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but you never really replaced me.

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can tell you why.

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because you all practice it with my long life.

23
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The long life is the master of the blood.

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It won't be the master of the blood.

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It won't be the master of the blood.

26
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The master of the blood will not hurt his master.

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So you can't hurt me at all.

28
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you understand?

29
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I can't hurt you, but I can hurt him.

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Episode 1

31
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Episode 1

32
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Chong Guang, the blood is your destiny.

33
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The blood is your destiny.

34
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No matter how much you try to help me,

35
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you can't help me anymore.

36
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No!

37
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hurry and take her away.

38
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hurry and take her away.

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll let you take her away.

40
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Chong Guang has been killed by me.

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He can't stop me.

42
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You can't stop me either.

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No one can stop me.

44
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No one can stop me.

45
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mu Rong Changfeng, you've killed all of the people in Shushan.

46
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You've made a big deal out of it.

47
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're so selfish.

48
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Qing Yue, I'll take your life for Shushan's sake.

49
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,120
I'll avenge my master for those

50
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,000
who died for you.

51
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll avenge my master for you.

52
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll avenge my master for you.

53
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll avenge my master for you.

54
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll avenge my master for you.

55
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll avenge my master for you.

56
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll avenge my master for you.

57
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ning Huan.

58
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,720
As long as the wind and wind are strong,

59
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
you can live on forever.

60
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,360
Whether it's a thousand years ago,

61
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
or now,

62
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,840
I only want you to live well.

63
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The Great Wall of Heaven

64
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Episode 1

65
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Mo Xiao!

66
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
Come down here!

67
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
You're no longer a disciple of Mount Chu!

68
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
You don't need to be ordered by the wind and wind!

69
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Mo Xiao!

70
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Brother Mo Xiao!

71
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,800
The wind and wind will make you bleed.

72
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
You'll be in a bad state.

73
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
You can't do this!

74
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Brother Mo Xiao!

75
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Mo Xiao!

76
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,200
The sword is a life-saving thing.

77
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not that you're in a bad state.

78
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Come down here!

79
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
We have other ways.

80
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,200
We can't do this.

81
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Let's see the sword and sword today.

82
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let's ask the God of God to send the order again.

83
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,400
Why do you have to regret it?

84
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You...

85
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ling Yue.

86
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The wind and wind and wind are strong,

88
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you can't move.

89
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,400
Otherwise, the God of Heaven will find out

90
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
that the efforts of the thousand years will be wasted.

91
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
You go!

92
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Ling Yue.

93
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Jing'er.

94
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Murong Ze.

95
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I can do anything for you.

96
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm already a member of Mo Xiao.

97
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Brother Mo!

98
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
I can't protect the love of the gods.

99
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,800
I can only wait for the next life.

100
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
The wind and wind will send me back to Mount Chu.

101
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,400
I'll follow the spirit to help Mo Xiao.

102
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,800
I'll definitely protect the thousand years.

103
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Go back.

104
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
I'll go back.

105
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,200
Go back.

106
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,200
Go back.

107
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
Go back.

108
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,200
Go back.

109
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Go back.

110
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Go back.

111
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Master.

112
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
Why did you bring me here?

113
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Because here

114
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,000
is where Master and you started.

115
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
When girls grow up,

116
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
the first thing you need to learn

117
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
is to give yourself a free time.

118
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
We are one.

119
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
You are always, always

120
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
my Li Xue.

121
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,200
As long as you want to do it,

122
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,800
Master will agree to you.

123
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't hate you.

124
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
But I can't love you.

125
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
We are one.

126
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
We are one.

127
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
From now on,

128
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,400
we will be one.

129
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No matter what you do,

130
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
no matter what you do,

131
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,200
you will always be one.

132
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,000
Even if you are one,

133
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
you will still make me

134
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
the one who is in the air.

135
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,000
Master, you can't go.

136
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You can't go.

137
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You can't.

138
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Master.

139
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Master.

140
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's go.

141
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,360
This is Master

142
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
who has mai last time for your life.

143
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I've told you before.

144
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We are one body.

145
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We are both one and one.

146
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's not because of the military situation.

147
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's because

148
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
our bloodline is the same.

149
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You are my part.

150
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Why did you do this?

151
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why did you do this?

152
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
From the job of yours.

153
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,400
I put my full forces into зд

154
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
and iy to fight you.

155
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,060
Ikkeh'd iz

156
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,600
to recover my bloodline?

157
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I don't think I can do anything

158
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
to make you hate me, hurt me, or hurt me.

159
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I think I have a lot of time

160
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
to make up for you

161
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
and save you.

162
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Anyway,

163
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I can accompany you to the end

164
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
and save you.

165
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Only me.

166
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Don't care about me.

167
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Go save Li Xue.

168
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
You promised me

169
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
that she would be useful to you.

170
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Save you.

171
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Save her.

172
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Li Xue.

173
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
My blood is getting worse.

174
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I only have a few hours.

175
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I can't stay in the palace for long.

176
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
But my Li Xue

177
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,600
will live on for a long time.

178
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
I will be your wife.

179
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I will be your wife.

180
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I will be your wife.

181
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
I will be your wife.

182
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
I will be your wife.

183
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,780
��可你�

184
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,100
血海

185
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,600
你把濱青腹给我了

186
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Master.

187
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Master.

188
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Master.

189
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Thousands of years of lonely soul,

190
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
floating in the world.

191
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
With this ten years of friendship,

192
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I should be satisfied.

193
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Li Xue.

194
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I have given you the most powerful power in this world.

195
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Help me live well.

196
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Master.

197
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Master.

198
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
You let me live here.

199
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I will send you off here.

200
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Master.

201
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Master.

202
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Master.

203
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Master.

204
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Master.

205
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I'm older than you.

206
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm Senior Sister.

207
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Go.

208
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
If I'm older than you,

209
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm Senior Brother.

210
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
After this,

211
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
no one in the Three Realms can find you.

212
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Except me.

213
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Master.

214
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
You've protected the Heaven Realm for thousands of years.

215
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Today, I'm here to protect you.

216
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
If the Three Realms are to be harmed,

217
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I will be with the Three Realms.

218
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Master.

219
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Master.

220
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Master.

221
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Master.

222
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Master.

223
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Master.

224
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Hua Lang.

225
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
You've been here to protect her.

226
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Is that so?

227
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
She's very silly.

228
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Right?

229
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
She's still that warrior.

230
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
She hasn't changed at all.

231
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
She loves the world for her love.

232
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
She can sacrifice anything.

233
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
She can be a good girl.

234
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Yes.

235
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
She's good at everything.

236
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,600
She always makes people sad.

237
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
But you must not stop her.

238
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Why?

239
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
You're a talented woman.

240
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
You can go anywhere.

241
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
You can't go to the East.

242
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Hua Lang, you don't understand.

243
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
You can go anywhere.

244
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I can't go to the East.

245
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Mo Xiao.

246
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Let me help you.

247
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Ying Hua.

248
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Go.

249
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Mo Xiao.

250
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Mo Xiao.

251
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Mo Xiao.

252
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Mo Xiao.

253
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Why are you still so silly?

254
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Mo Xiao.

255
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Mo Xiao.

256
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Mo Xiao.

257
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Why are you still so silly?

258
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Do you know that

259
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
in this world,

260
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I only hope that you can live well.

261
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
But I'm still alive.

262
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Will that be okay?

263
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Why are you still so silly?

264
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Ying Hua.

265
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm afraid you're going to be gone.

266
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
This Sword-Prayer is only a second time.

267
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Tian Jian will definitely touch your spirit.

268
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
At that time,

269
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
it will be wasted only a thousand years.

270
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
A thousand years ago,

271
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
you saved me with your dragon pig.

272
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Do you want to use the primordial spirit to save me?

273
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Because I want you to live well!

274
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Ni Huang.

275
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Hurry and go.

276
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Go to the capital to meet the wind and wherever you want to go.

277
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
This world is beautiful.

278
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
It's worth living well.

279
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Go.

280
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Hurry and go.

281
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Ba Xiao.

282
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Please give me a second life.

283
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,600
You used to be a phoenix and sleep in the water.

284
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Now,

285
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
I should have known it.

286
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Ni Huang.

287
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Ni Huang.

288
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,400

A prettier one, okay?

342
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Last time, my sect leader, Ji Ren Da,

343
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,380
just because of your fun, you've misunderstood me.

344
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,880
Today is your wedding.

Are you going to let all the guests wait?

346
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,380
Uncle Xie and Uncle Quan Zhen are already in the front hall.

347
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,380
Xie Ling Yun, why aren't you going?

348

What does it look like?

349
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,380
It's all because of Ling Yun.

350
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
He said he made me a wedding gift.

351
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
I'm curious.

352
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,380

Why are you so angry?

356
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,380
