1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Always

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There is no miracle, no miracle, the waves are in the river

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The falling flowers are flowing, no water is no shadow

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The flowers of life are like dreams, like you

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no breath, no breath

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The tears are all gone

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain of another life

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll wait for you in the next life

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll wait for you

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Young Mistress

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Young Mistress, why are you here?

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You've been doing things for father

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's the big deal?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What does he want to do?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Young Mistress, you have no idea what you are planning to do?

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What do you mean?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It seems that you know too much

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Master, Chang Ming Yi took the boat and drove off the mountain

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He asked you to wait for him

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Master

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I've waited for long enough

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But I've finally waited

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Chong Guang finally found the son of Ye Yuan

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He's going to open the world order

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Congratulations, Master

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The night is coming

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Congratulations to you

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You've been with him for so many years

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You finally have to work

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Master, can Chang Ming see you?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Of course

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As long as we get the order of money

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Your brother can meet again

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you, Master

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That year

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ye Yuan revived Chong Guang with the blood of the Demon Lord

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He got the blood of Chang Sheng

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He's going to die

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But there's no body that's going to die

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You've been with him for so many years

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You've already known the fate of the Demon Lord

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As long as we break the Demon Lord

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Even if he has the biggest power

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's not a big deal

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This Bu Zhou Mountain battle

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All depends on you

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's wrong?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You don't want to see your sister?

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm willing to help you to revive Chong Guang

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But Master

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have one last request

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I hope you agree

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Tell me

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Can you keep him a life?

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Can you keep him a life?

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Tomorrow

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You really want to open the demon forest

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't you want to go to the mountain?

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mother

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you know

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why Master and a devil

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
will be taught by the Mount Zu.

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,800
And then, he will walk away

111
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,560
and protect the people of the former Qiu Ling.

112
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,800
He will be the one to blame.

113
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,360
It's because I've known it for a long time.

114
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
It's not that the people of the former Qiu Ling

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
should be protected.

116
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,320
It's the true heart of the people of the world.

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,960
If the people's heart is correct,

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
no matter how correct or wrong,

119
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,920
the former Qiu Ling doesn't need to be protected.

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,400
If the people's heart is like a demon,

121
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,120
the Immortal Sect will also be the demon.

122
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,480
But I have never changed.

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,040
Then leave me alone.

124
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,120
Because of what you're doing

125
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,920
between the Lord and me?

126
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,760
I'll do anything.

127
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
Look at us now.

128
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,920
I want them to marry Mo Xiao for me.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have been a father for 18 years.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But I have just found you.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you have a reason...

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Mother, get up.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm alive.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The most embarrassing thing is that I have a mother who is so wise.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm not a father.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have a mother who is so wise.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm really grateful to you.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I can't even change my mind.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have Yun Zhao to take care of mother for me.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If one day, I have an accident.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No, you won't be okay.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You won't be okay.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mother.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have something to ask you.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You tell me.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In this world,

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
apart from me,

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
there is someone I am guilty of.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If tomorrow, I really get a good result,

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I will not be able to do anything.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I will not be able to do anything.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I will not be able to tell her personally.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mother, please tell her for me.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I have prepared a place for her to live in Tao Hua Waterfall.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It will be a peaceful life.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Mother.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What are you doing here?

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm here to take you away.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you kidding me?

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What?

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You are looking at the Demon Lord of the Sky.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You are here to steal and repay my heart.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm here to take you away.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm here to take you away.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why are you laughing?

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Why?

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You shouldn't come back.

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You shouldn't be a Demon Lord.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Once you choose this path,

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you can't go back.

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Why should I go back?

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you really going to return to the Demon Lord?

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You told me to leave Chong Guang

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and go back to the Sunlight again.

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why are you going back now?

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are not a righteous person.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, you are the one who is going to return to the Demon Lord.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't understand.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Since I was born, I have been a Demon Lord.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Being a Demon Lord is the path I should take.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Silly.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I won't forget this place.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But one day,

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
we will meet a real person

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
who belongs to our own family.

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Mo Xiao,

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
do you still remember

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
when you were leading the three-day life,

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you told me

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you wanted to be a man and wife with me?

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Let's go.

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What?

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Mo Xiao has died long ago.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You are now a Demon Lord.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate to say that.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can hate me,

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
blame me,

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
or punish me.

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But you can't give up on yourself.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You are the youngest

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and most young.

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When you were born,

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
you were a god.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You were a simple and kind heart.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You are the best in the world.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You are like a light of the Demon Lord.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You have found the whole blood.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Mo Xiao,

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
what's wrong with you?

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why did you come to remind me

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
of what Mo Xiao was like?

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
With this hand-made sand,

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
you can't stop me

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
from getting punished.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hand-made sand?

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You planted it?

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Let me see.

219
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let me see.

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You are so unique.

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm afraid you will make people hate you.

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Please be kind to me.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Please go back.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mo Xiao.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Go.

226
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Go.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You are back.

228
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You are going to the Demon Lord again?

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I told you

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
that he will finally walk up this path.

231
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No one can change it.

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He has accepted it.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What about you?

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You should accept

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
the path you are on.

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You are the one who will walk up this path.

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You should accept it.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We have no choice.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And all this

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
is because of your kindness.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The Chess Order

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is a sacred weapon.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It can open up

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the people's mind.

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
All this

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
is just a summoner of the Chess Order.

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Back then,

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
my father and I

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
almost succeeded.

251
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Finally,

252
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
we were stopped by Feng Yue.

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now,

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
even if he is a Chess Order,

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
he still has the blood of Ye Yuan.

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Who else

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
can stop him?

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
As long as tomorrow

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
he can summon

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
100,000 Demons

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and move to the Mount Bu Zhou.

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The Chess Order

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is mine.

264
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
How can you be sure

265
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that he will help you?

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Because

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
this is his life.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He has no choice.

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Today,

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
if you can

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
be the Chess Order

272
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and summon

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
100,000 Demons,

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the Chess Order

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
of the Chess Order

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
will be yours.

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
will be the Chess Order

280
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
of the Chess Order.

281
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Thank you, Chong Quan.

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Again.

336
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000

.

339
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Tian Mo苑 has indeed set foot on him!

340
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Feng Li Xue,

341
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
what do you want to do?

342
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Everyone of you listen to me.

343
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
We all have Now all of it,

344
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,240
in Feng Li Xue's hand.

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,840
You can't.

346
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,640
Most of the demons are crazy.

347
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,240
You're going to die too.

348
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,080
Give it back to me!

349
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Prime Minister.

350
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,440
This time,

351
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,940
I'm here to make you a choice.

352
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,580
I don't want to take the consequences of being killed on your death revenge.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,980
Some people have applied the existing condition

354
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,400
others are longing for a long time

355
00:17:45,400 --> 00:18:08,860
Jun Orb

356
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:16,260
The sword in the eyes, the thread in the heart.

357
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,660
Always wind blows, fog blows, waves blow, wind blows, river blows.

358
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,660
The soft flower flows, the water flows, no doubt.

359
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,060
The flowers in the past life are like dreams, like you.

360
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,460
Always thousands of years, thousands of years, no words, no words.

361
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,260
The tears are not easy to shed, the rain in another life.

362
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:49,260
You will wait for the next night.

363
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,860
The sound of my heart is breaking in my eyes.

364
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,060
The moment I turn around and look at the piece.

365
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:13,260
The moon in my mind is hard to break, the moon in my heart.

366
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,260
There is a deep regret in my heart.

367
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,660
The flowers fall and the flowers bloom in the wind.

368
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,660
The moon in the water, the moon in the earth.

369
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,060
The moon in the water, the moon in the earth.

370
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,260
Always wind blows, fog blows, waves blow, wind blows, river blows.

371
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,260
The soft flower flows, the water flows, no doubt.

372
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,860
The flowers in the past life are like dreams, like you.

373
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,060
Always thousands of years, thousands of years, no words, no words.

374
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,060
The tears are not easy to shed, the rain in another life.

375
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:59,260
You will wait for the next night.

376
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,860
Mother, brother is a bloodbath of night.

377
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
Tian Mo Ling will not hurt him.

378
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
Let's wait a little longer.

379
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,860
No.

380
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,060
No!

381
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
My child!

382
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,860
Xiao Zhu!

383
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,460
Xiao Zhu, don't think I will lie to you.

384
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Xiao Zhu!

385
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,060
Xiao Zhu!

386
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,260
Li Xue.

387
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,660
Li Xue, go save Li Xue.

388
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,860
Master, you have a great reaction.

389
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,060
You have already gone to the primordial deity.

390
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,060
You must protect the primordial deity first.

391
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,660
Li Xue cannot die.

392
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,860
Go save her!

393
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Okay. I will think of a way.

394
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,660
Li Xue!

395
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,860
Li Xue! Li Xue!

396
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Li Xue!

397
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Li Xue!

398
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
Li Xue!

399
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
I am the right-hand man, Tushu.

400
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Greetings to the young master.

401
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Right-hand man?

402
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Senior.

403
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Tushu was the right-hand man who was chasing after the night master.

404
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,660
In the battle of Buzhou Mountain, the master was killed.

405
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Chong Guang was the one who got the master's position.

406
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
I dare not to let Chong Guang down.

407
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,660
Chong Guang was killed by him.

408
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
I was lucky.

409
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,660
After I got into the spiritual power, I was able to survive.

410
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Tushu finally waited for the young master to return.

411
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
I was able to save him.

412
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Senior, we will go there again.

413
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Save Li Xue first.

414
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,660
I have just checked his heart.

415
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,660
He has the power of the three-star stone.

416
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,660
But he is not the blood of the night demon.

417
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,660
If this power is in the Heavenly Demon's heart,

418
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,660
it will definitely kill the night demon.

419
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Then what can we do to save him?

420
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,660
To save him, there is only one way.

421
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,660
We will pour the three-star stone's Heavenly Demon power into your body.

422
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Then pour it to me.

423
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,660
But once the Heavenly Demon power is poured into your body,

424
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,660
it will be in your body that the Immortal Sect will be in the middle.

425
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
Immortal Demon will be eliminated.

426
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
This is a pain.

427
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
It is not easy to eliminate.

428
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Young Master, you...

429
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,660
Senior, I am willing to start.

430
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,660
Master, I am willing to start.

431
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
I am willing to start.

432
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,660
I am willing to start.

433
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,660
I am willing to start.

434
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,660
I am willing to start.

435
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,660
I am willing to start.

436
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,660
I am willing to start.

437
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
I am willing to start.

438
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,660
I am willing to start.

439
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,660
I am willing to start.

440
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,660
I am willing to start.

441
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,660
I am willing to start.

442
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,660
I am willing to start.

443
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,660
I am willing to start.

444
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,660
I am willing to start.

445
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,660
I am willing to start.

446
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,660
I am willing to start.

447
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,660
I am willing to start.

448
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,660
I am willing to start.

449
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,660
I am willing to start.

450
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,660
I am willing to start.

451
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,660
I am willing to start.

452
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,660
I am willing to start.

453
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I am willing to start.

454
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,660
I am willing to start.

455
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,660
I am willing to start.

456
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,660
I am willing to start.

457
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,660
I am willing to start.

458
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,660
If Feng Yue allows,

459
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,660
the doctor Kemo will handle this.

460
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,260
What do you want to do?

461
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,580
You are the son of Ye Yuan.

462
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,460
You are the blood of the Demon Clan.

463
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,580
You can only be the Demon if you are destined to die.

464
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,820
I am the Demon.

465
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,580
But I want to make a big deal out of it.

466
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,980
I did what I can.

467
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,580
It's not my fault.

468
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,260
I won't be ashamed of myself.

469
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,980
All the people in the world are sure that you are the Demon.

470
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,500
You are the Demon.

471
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,900
The Immortal Sect has been holding you.

472
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,780
Don't let your destiny decide that you can only be the Demon.

473
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,980
No.

474
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
No.

475
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
No.

476
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
No.

477
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,980
You can only be the Demon.

478
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
You...

479
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,180
Give me your life.

480
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,180
No.

481
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
No.

482
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Your Highness.

483
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,780
Mo Xiao, are you ready to give up?

484
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Your Highness.

485
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,380
Why didn't you kill me?

486
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,380
Kill me?

487
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,980
But now you make me suffer this.

488
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,380
I am so tired.

489
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,980
I am so tired.

490
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,980
Mo Xiao.

491
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,380
The Demon is the Demon.

492
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,580
It's in your heart.

493
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,180
From now on,

494
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,980
that's my象.

495
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,180
What do you think, Mr. scores?

496
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,180
Let me explain you three things.

497
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,480
If you were the one who needed

498
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,180
the�ut Bogunan in cash

499
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Mo Xiao.

500
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,780
Don't be so nervous.

501
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,780
Consider that you have Black Sun Pavilion.

502
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,780
No matter where you are, you will never be mine.

503
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,780
Mo Xiao, don't be wronged.

504
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,780
Don't give up.

505
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,780
Master killed you for your loyalty.

506
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,780
It's the immortal spirit that has been with you for generations.

507
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,780
It protects your heart.

508
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,780
If you keep your heart, you will be immortal.

509
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,780
The immortal spirit will only be your family.

510
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,780
You will be immortal.

511
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
You don't have to ask your heart.

512
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,780
You don't have to blame yourself for it.

513
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
Believe in your heart.

514
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
No matter what you should do.

515
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Don't forget the blood of the two of us.

516
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,780
What did I do to help you?

517
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,780
I was taken care of by the people.

518
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,780
I have been prepared for the demon.

519
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,780
But master, the demon is not here.

520
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,780
What should I do?

521
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,780
Tell me.

522
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,780
What should I do?

523
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,780
Tell me.

524
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,780
What should I do?

525
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,780
You have the immortal spirit's hand.

526
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,780
You have the demon's power.

527
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,780
You must be careful.

528
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Master, I have never seen anyone who can be immortal.

529
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
Master.

530
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
Master.

531
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,780
She said she would just keep her spirit for life.

532
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,780
stores the spirit of Master Hu like a Doc.

533
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
So what?

534
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,680
That's the effect that Master Hu would use in getting evil word

535
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,780
in him.

536
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,340
Shifu.

537
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,300
You Huofang.

538
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
I have been waiting with young steamed bun for many years,

539
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,980
which won't cost you much honor,

540
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,460
killing you.

541
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,260
It's obvious that the three world

542
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
most foolish devils and checkers

543
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,740
are above us

544
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,460
and stop flavors now.

545
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,380
The evil has the magic on it

546
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,260
but each man in the two worlds

547
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,280
decide on his own,

548
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,580
but onlyashed.

549
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,380
But since the fall of the mountain and the rebirth of the mountain,

550
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,180
everything has changed.

551
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,180
The world has been in disaster. It has been in a state of disdain.

552
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,780
How about the ancestors? How about the demons?

553
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,180
I'm afraid that the path of the book will be the same.

554
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,980
But the path of the book will be the same.

555
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,580
The Path of the Book

556
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,580
The path of the book will be the same.

557
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,980
The Path of the Book

558
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Listen to me. Everyone will not believe you.

559
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,580
You are always impulsive and you are always impulsive.

560
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,980
Everyone's eyes are never important.

561
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,980
The Path of the Book

562
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,380
You are right.

563
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,980
You are always impulsive and you are always impulsive.

Lingxue.

682
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,860
I thought that after I woke up, I saw what I saw with my soul.

683
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,860
I didn't expect that everything was real.

684
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:20,860
After the spiritual pearl was replaced, you actually turned everything into real.

685
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Silly. With me around, how could you be in trouble?

686
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,860
How could you be in trouble?

687
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,860
Your hand is not working anymore.

688
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,860
In the Sky Demon Garden, the Sky Demon Spirit has sent out the magic that I have.

689
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,860
I'm glad that you and Master are together. It's fine now.

690
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
That's great.

691
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
I have to take it seriously.

692
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,860
The Sky Demon Garden has a lot of magic that is so dangerous. How could you just jump?

693
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,860
I just don't want Chong Guang to force you.

694
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
Why are you so silly?

695
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,860
If I didn't get up to save you,

696
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,860
the Sky Demon Spirit and the Sky Demon Spirit will all disappear in the Sky Demon Garden.

697
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Even you...

698
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I'm not afraid.

699
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,860
As long as I'm doing what you're doing, I'm not afraid of anything.

700
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
Silly.

701
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Mo Xiao, you said that we have already left the Sky Demon Garden.

702
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,860
Don't you need to do what the Fairy Demon has told you to do?

703
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,860
I was just thinking about what the Fairy Demon has told me.

704
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,860
I thought that there are only three people in the Spirit Bead.

705
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,860
I didn't expect that...

706
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I'm really happy that something good happened. Right?

707
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,860
The world is full of fruits.

708
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
Life is full of years.

709
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
This life is impossible.

710
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
This day is the most difficult.

711
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Li Xuan.

712
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,860
Promise me.

713
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,860
From now on, don't do anything stupid.

714
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Okay.

715
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,860
