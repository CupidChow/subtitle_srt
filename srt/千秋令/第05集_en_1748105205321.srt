1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the wind, the moon is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the waves of the fog are up

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows and the waves of the fog are up

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The flowers in the water are not shadow

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers in the water are like dreams

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like you

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've been careful not to be careful

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't get away from the tears

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain in another world

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll wait for you at home

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll wait for you at home

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll wait for you at home

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You are awake

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You are like a snow

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are different from me

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm just a small dot in the clouds

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't open my mouth for a while

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It seems that your wound is not too good

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Eat some more

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's wrong with you

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You want to eat some fruit

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You still use a kind

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can see the way to understand

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Tell me better

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Or you

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Open your eyes

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Just want to eat some juice

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Open your eyes

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Just want to eat some fruit

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You want to eat some juice

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then I'll help you

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You are happy to see it

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Come

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Xiao'er, be closer

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, I know you are hungry

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But the fruit is finished

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then I'll give you a home meal

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yours is snow peach

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Where is the tomorrow

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mine is

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's red and beautiful

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A little sour

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is obviously snow

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You are awake

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can move

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can still speak

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then you are like me

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You are different from Xue'er

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are usually like this

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's not possible to live

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I know this

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But Xue'er is really too hungry

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Our fruit is also full of fruit

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I always want to eat it

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I always want to eat it

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will eat it

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will eat it

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I will eat it

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I will eat it

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I will eat it

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I will eat it

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will eat it

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I will eat it

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you for saving your life

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
How about this

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll help you to eat it

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's not good

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There are many snow wolves here

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you go to fight with snow wolves

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then don't go

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Little which

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If not

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's gonna be wet

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Snow

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Or

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We should go to observer

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,120
Anyway, we don't need to divide into three.

114
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,680
We should be able to eat full stomach. Let's go.

115
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm back.

116
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
You're back.

117
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
What is this?

118
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,320
The stone lions in the mountains only came to Tianming.

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
We've waited for a long time. Let's eat while it's hot.

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,000
This is the food that the people in the mountains eat.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,440
That's right. I think that snow and wild grass are not enough to overcome.

122
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,240
So I bought some glutinous rice balls in the market.

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm hungry. I should eat this.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,360
Xue'er, let's go. We don't have wild fruits to eat.

125
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,520
If you really don't eat, I can only feed it to the snow wolf.

126
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,920
This is a waste.

127
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,400
But if the snow wolf knows that I don't have food from the people in the mountains,

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,920
he will come to me to trouble me.

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
You're right.

130
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,120
Then you can exchange these for my wild fruits.

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,040
Okay. Hurry and eat while it's hot. If it's cold, it won't taste good.

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,320
Your wound hasn't healed yet. Do you want to take some more of this to exchange for my wild fruits?

133
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
No. I still have a chance to return to the stone lions' house.

134
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll take my leave now.

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,720
Wait. After you leave, I won't be able to eat glutinous rice balls anymore.

136
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,320
If you want to eat, you can only eat it in the mountains.

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,120
Miss, it's my intuition. This mountain of snow is not a place for a word.

138
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
You'd rather go down the mountain to look for a village.

139
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,520
You're in the village. If you take care of each other like this,

140
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,120
you'll feel more comfortable in the form of a temporary residence.

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,920
I can't go down the mountain.

142
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Why?

143
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,520
I'm different from the commoners.

144
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Since you have this intuition, I won't ask you more.

145
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,920
If you want to go down the mountain in the future,

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,720
you can go to Mount Zu to find me.

147
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,520
Report to my name. I'll definitely help you.

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,320
Mo Xiao?

149
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
May I ask your name?

150
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Name?

151
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,320
This name is your name.

152
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,720
Wu Chen.

153
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Xu Er.

154
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,120
Miss Wu Chen, I'll take my leave now. We'll meet again in the future.

155
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,520
Look.

156
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,520
I've already eaten the glutinous rice dough.

157
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,520
The silver juice and the oil are not good to eat.

158
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Miss Wu Chen.

159
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Miss Wu Chen.

160
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Miss Wu Chen.

161
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Miss Wu Chen.

162
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Are you okay?

163
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I still want to eat the glutinous rice dough.

164
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Okay.

165
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Miss Wu Chen.

166
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,520
We're not working at the end of this journey.

167
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,000
We lost the other two together.

168
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,400
The world was in pickup.

169
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,680
We must eat together, not be induvid satisfactions.

170
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
Miss, this time the medicine tastes weird and black.

171
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
He did it himself.

172
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Where is Wu Chen?

173
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Mo Xiao took him down the mountain.

174
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
So smoothly?

175
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Since Wu Chen has left,

176
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Xue Hu doesn't need to stay in the cave.

177
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
After the demon is removed from the mountain,

178
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
he will come back to the tea.

179
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I just sealed his demon aura with the seal.

180
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,720
He will stay there and show his magic.

181
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Do you want to kill him?

182
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
No.

183
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Stay here.

184
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
I have a place to stay.

185
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
His spirit is so strong in me.

186
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I am a stranger.

187
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,720
I have been fighting with my body for so long.

188
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
But before he passed away,

189
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
who is he?

190
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
You are not afraid of me?

191
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Why are you not afraid of my body?

192
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,720
You are the first person in this world to enter my body.

193
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
I was born to be a stranger.

194
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
No one can enter my body.

195
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
You are so amazing.

196
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
You are the first person in this world

197
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
who is not afraid of my body.

198
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Miss Wu Chen,

199
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,720
do you know where you got the energy from?

200
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
I don't know.

201
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I don't know why the energy in my body came here.

202
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
I don't know how to get out of here.

203
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
I can't control it.

204
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
So I live alone in the snow mountain.

205
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Why?

206
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Do you also hate my energy?

207
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
No.

208
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Why does Qi Han

209
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
have the same energy as Li Xue?

210
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Is it possible?

211
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
No.

212
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
It's impossible.

213
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Li Xue is dead.

214
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
I saw it myself.

215
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
She is dead.

216
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Immortal.

217
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Immortal.

218
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Immortal helped us get rid of the monster.

219
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
It's good to have the shape.

220
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
You are welcome.

221
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
This monster is the essence of my disciple.

222
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
But Immortal,

223
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
you bring back the girl.

224
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Yes.

225
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Miss Wu Chen is the girl I have been looking for.

226
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I brought her to the village to heal her.

227
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Good.

228
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
What's wrong with you?

229
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,720
It's just that the mountain is so far away.

230
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
There is no one in the snow.

231
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
What about the girl?

232
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
It's not good.

233
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Miss Wu Chen.

234
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Immortal.

235
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Why are you looking for her?

236
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
It's warm.

237
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
You are not afraid of me.

238
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
It's warm.

239
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Aren't you afraid of me?

240
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
I am not afraid of you.

241
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Aren't you cold?

242
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
I am not cold.

243
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
I am a little bit cold.

244
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Uncle.

245
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Are you afraid of me?

246
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Immortal.

247
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Don't misunderstand.

248
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Don't misunderstand.

249
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
They are all warm like you.

250
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Miss Wu Chen.

251
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
You should learn to protect yourself.

252
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
It's hard for a girl to be hurt.

253
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
What is it?

254
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
It's hard for a girl to be hurt.

255
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Let me explain to you later.

256
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Look at them.

257
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Follow me.

258
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Is this pretty?

259
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Yes.

260
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Look at the windmill.

261
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
It's fun.

262
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
It's fun.

263
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Look.

264
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Miss.

265
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
You haven't given me the money.

266
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
What is the money?

267
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
You are playing with me.

268
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
What is the money?

269
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
The money is the ancestors.

270
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
The ancestors?

271
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
What is the ancestors?

272
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Can you play with me?

273
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
I am your little girl.

274
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I am here to find tea.

275
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Boss.

276
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Sir.

277
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
You are...

278
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Can you take away the thing

279
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
she wants?

280
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Yes.

281
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Take it.

282
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Thank you.

283
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
What did you give them?

284
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
You asked them to give me this?

285
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Remember.

286
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
The first thing you want

287
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
is to exchange the items

288
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
with the other ones.

289
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
What are the items?

290
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
This one.

291
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
This one?

292
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
I think these items

293
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
should be enough

294
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
for you to exchange the basic life.

295
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I can take

296
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
the items I like.

297
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
That's right.

298
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
This one is for you.

299
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
This one is for me.

300
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Boss.

301
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
This one is for you.

302
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Thank you, boss.

303
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Here.

304
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Boss.

305
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
This one is for you.

306
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Is it good?

307
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Boss.

308
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Thank you for giving me this.

309
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
It's really good.

310
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
We have changed the street

311
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
twice.

312
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Where are we going next?

313
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Go ahead and check it.

314
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Okay.

315
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Follow me.

316
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
What is this place for?

317
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
We are going to change our clothes?

318
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
That's right.

319
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Let's see if we like it.

320
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Sir,

321
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Sir, are you buying clothes?

323
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Yes.

324
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
I'll put this on

325
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
this lady.

326
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Okay.

327
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Then Miss Han Jin

328
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
will try it on first.

329
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Give this to me.

330
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Wait.

331
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Hurry up.

332
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Hurry up.

333
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
What is this?

334
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
What is this?

335
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
What is this?

336
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Is it done?

337
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Yes.

338
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
It's so simple.

339
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
You will do this for me

340
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
in the future.

341
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
The second one.

342
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
It's not easy to

343
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
avoid people when you want to wear clothes.

344
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Even you want to avoid them.

345
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Of course.

346
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Okay.

347
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
No.

348
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
It's a special thing.

349
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Then the peasant girl.

350
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Now I'm confused.

351
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Can I go home?

352
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
You can go.

353
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
You can go.

354
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
I'll go.

355
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Okay?

356
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Okay, let's play.

357
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Let's play.

358
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Pan Zi is coming.

359
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Pan Zi is coming.

360
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Wait.

361
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
You need a gesture.

362
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
This is the fourth rule.

363
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Good.

364
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
I used chopsticks.

365
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
This is the fourth rule.

366
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Don't touch your head.

367
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
The fifth rule.

368
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Don't do anything on the street.

369
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
The sixth rule.

370
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Don't look left and right when you walk.

371
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
The seventh rule.

372
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Don't touch anyone's head when you're with someone else.

373
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Especially when you touch someone's head.

374
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
What are you doing?

375
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I didn't touch you.

376
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Let go.

377
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Let go.

378
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Let go.

379
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
The seventh rule.

380
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Don't touch anyone's items.

381
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Girls should be careful about the rules and etiquette.

382
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
The twenty-eighth rule.

383
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Don't look at anyone when you're walking.

384
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
And the twenty-nineh rule.

385
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
The twenty-nineh rule.

386
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
The twenty-nineh rule.

387
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
When someone talks to you,

388
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
you should listen carefully and carefully.

389
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
This is a respect and respect for others.

390
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
You're hurt.

391
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
How did you get hurt?

392
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,720
The thirty-eighth rule.

393
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
You're hurt.

394
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
How did you get hurt?

395
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
This is the most important rule in the thirty-eighth rule.

396
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Listen carefully.

397
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Don't ask anything on the street.

398
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
I asked you to marry me.

399
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Now I want to give you a new rule.

400
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
What rule?

401
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
This rule is...

402
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,720
You can't give me a new rule!

403
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
This is not a busy mountain.

404
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Nor is it the snow mountain you're familiar with.

405
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
You only need to get used to these rules

406
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,720
to live well with the villagers.

407
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I did all this for your own good.

408
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,720
You want me to live with the villagers?

409
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Hua.

410
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
What's this?

411
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
It's a bookshelf box.

412
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
What's a bookshelf box?

413
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Didn't your mother make it for you?

414
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
I don't have a mother.

415
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
You don't have a mother?

416
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
You're so pitiful.

417
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I'm not pitiful.

418
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
You don't have a mother.

419
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Who's pitiful?

420
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I don't have a mother.

421
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I don't have a glutinous rice ball.

422
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I'm pitiful.

423
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
How did you live

424
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
on the busy mountain?

425
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
No one was hurt.

426
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
No one taught you.

427
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Come.

428
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Let's sit down.

429
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Sister Wu Chen, you're so beautiful.

430
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
What do you mean?

431
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Is it good or bad?

432
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Of course it's good.

433
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Mr. Wu, you're leaving?

434
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I've been busy with my studies.

435
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Now Miss Wu Chen is unwell.

436
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
I should go back to my husband's house.

437
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Miss Wu Chen has been living on the busy mountain for a long time.

438
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Now she's resting in the village.

439
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Please take care of her.

440
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
I'll do my best to

441
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
take care of her.

442
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
I'll let my son and Miss Wu Chen

443
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
be sisters.

444
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I'll stay at home and teach her.

445
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
I'll thank Jia Wu for her care.

446
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Of course I won't let her down.

447
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Don't worry.

448
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
It's not good for you.

449
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
I'll thank you for Miss Wu Chen.

450
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I won't bother you

451
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
for the rest of my life.

452
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
I'll leave now.

453
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
I won't leave

454
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
your husband's life.

455
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Please.

456
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Miss Wu Chen.

457
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Why are you still standing there?

458
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Come here.

459
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Miss Wu Chen,

460
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
you're unwell now.

461
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
As for your health,

462
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Han Zheng is not healthy at all.

463
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
I'm in a hurry to go back to the mountain.

464
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
So I'll keep you in your house for now.

465
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
I'll take you to the mountain.

466
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I'll go back to the mountain.

467
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
I'll go back to the mountain.

468
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
I'll go back to the mountain.

469
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
I'll take my husband back to the mountain.

470
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
I'll think of a way to cure Han Zheng for you.

471
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Am I beautiful?

472
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
What are you doing?

473
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
What about this?

474
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Am I beautiful?

475
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Miss Wu Chen,

476
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
who did you choose with?

477
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
What do you mean?

478
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Why did my magic

479
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
not work on you?

480
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
What magic?

481
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Hua,

482
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Hua,

483
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
why did you call me

484
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
magic that doesn't work on him?

485
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
What magic?

486
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
This.

487
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
A woman in the world

488
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
has a beauty

489
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,720
and has the most powerful magic.

490
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
What magic?

491
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
It's to make men

492
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,720
never leave you.

493
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,720
How can you use this magic?

494
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Miss Wu Chen,

495
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
that's...

496
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
that's the trick

497
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
that the woman said.

498
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
How can you

499
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
say that to the Immortal Sect?

500
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Miss Hua,

501
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
why did Miss Wu Chen

502
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
do something

503
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
that doesn't work on him?

504
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
There are some things

505
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
that we need to be taught.

506
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
What the Immortal Sect said

507
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
is a bit of a shame.

508
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Right, Miss Hua,

509
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
I brought some glutinous rice cakes here.

510
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
They're in the stove.

511
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
Please take them to Miss Wu Chen.

512
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
There are glutinous rice cakes?

513
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I'll go.

514
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Miss Hua,

515
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
my magic is useful.

516
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
The glutinous rice cake

517
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
is the best proof.

518
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Miss Wu Chen,

519
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
don't move.

520
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Be careful.

521
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
She's not going to say goodbye to you.

522
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Take care.

523
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Where's Mo Xiao?

524
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Where's Mo Xiao?

525
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
What are you doing?

526
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
What are you doing?

527
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Where is Mo Xiao?

528
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
You hide him.

529
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Immortal Sect has returned to the mountain.

530
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Don't make a fool of yourself.

531
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
He's gone.

532
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
He can't leave me.

533
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
He's been lying to me.

534
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm going to find him.

535
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Miss Wu Chen,

536
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm going to find him.

537
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
What?

538
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Miss Wu Chen,

539
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
is this the way to go?

540
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
I'm afraid

541
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
he is going to be in trouble.

542
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
What's wrong?

543
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
You're lying to me. I'm going to find her.

544
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Sister Wuchen.

545
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
You're not the only one who's not good at cleaning.

546
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Ah Hua, take her back to the room.

547
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Sister Wuchen, just go back with me.

548
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Ah Hua, don't touch me. Don't force me.

549
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Or I'll hurt you.

550
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
You two, hold her. Hold her.

551
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Pull her out.

552
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Don't force me. Don't force me.

553
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
I'll hurt myself.

554
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Let go of me.

555
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Don't force me.

556
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Ah Hua, don't force me.

557
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Sister Wuchen.

558
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
The late leader is a disciple of the late emperor.

559
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
He's a heartless and ungrateful person.

560
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
You're a mortal woman.

561
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
You can't be with him.

562
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
He has entrusted you to my family.

563
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Don't worry. We'll take good care of you.

564
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
What mortal woman?

565
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
He gave me a glutton.

566
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
He took me down the mountain.

567
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
I'm going to be with him.

568
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Sister,

569
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I understand your feelings.

570
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,720
But he's a immortal.

571
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,720
He won't be heartless to you.

572
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,720
You should just die.

573
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Let me go again.

574
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
You're living in my house.

575
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Two years have passed.

576
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
I helped you find a good person to marry.

577
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Then you'll have a daughter.

578
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Isn't life good?

579
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Do you want to let me go?

580
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Sister Wuchen.

581
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
Just listen to me.

582
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm doing this for your own good.

583
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Sister Wuchen.

584
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Here.

585
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Eat it.

586
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
This is so good.

587
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,720
What's going on?

588
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
What's going on?

589
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
Miss Wuchen.

590
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Wuchen.

591
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,720
I knew you wouldn't leave.

592
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,720
I need to tell you something.

593
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,720
It's all my fault for breaking the rules.

594
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,720
I forgot this.

595
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Cule, what's this?

596
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Now, if you keep your secret,

597
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,720
we'll have to go to Mount Shu.

598
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,720
No matter how great the world is,

599
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,720
the sect leader of Mount Shu will give us justice.

600
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,720
You should give us a good news.

601
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,720
You'll leave or not?

602
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,720
If that's the case, I'll take Wuchen back.

603
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Master, you're a great swordsman.

604
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,720
You're not just a demon.

605
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
You're taking her away.

606
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Master, I think you're confused by the demon.

607
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
That's right.

608
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
What do you want to do?

609
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Only the sect leader of Mount Shu will give you justice.

610
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I think you should leave the demon to us.

611
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
You can leave.

612
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Go!

613
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Hurry up!

614
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Hurry up!

615
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Master, you can't do this.

616
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
You're doing this to kill innocent people.

617
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Master, hurry up!

618
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Wuchen.

619
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Master!

620
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,720
The sect leader of Mount Shu is a man of the world.

621
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,720
He can't use magic to kill people.

622
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Are you going to break the rules of Mount Shu?

623
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
You're still a swordsman.

624
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
You're so evil.

625
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
The sect leader of Mount Shu is a demon.

626
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
But you're not good at dealing with the demon.

627
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
You're just insulting the sect leader.

628
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
That's right.

629
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
What do you mean?

630
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
You're just insulting the sect leader.

631
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
A disciple like that should be kicked out of the sect.

632
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
The sect leader of Mount Shu!

633
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
The sect leader of Mount Shu!

634
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
The sect leader of Mount Shu!

635
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Master.

636
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,720
I don't need the sect leader to teach me.

637
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,720
I can use my body to teach me.

638
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Is that okay?

639
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Cut it out.

640
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Cut it out.

641
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Hurry up.

642
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Hurry up, run!

643
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Hurry up.

644
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
Hua, I can't run anymore.

645
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Wuchen, run now.

646
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,720
If they find you, you'll be burned.

647
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Why are they burning me?

648
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Because you're a demon.

649
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Demon?

650
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,720
A demon will be burned to death.

651
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Demon will always harm people.

652
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Of course, it will be killed.

653
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,720
But, Hua, I've never hurt anyone.

654
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Didn't I tell you?

655
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Don't force me.

656
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I can't control my energy.

657
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Hurry up!

658
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Hurry up!

659
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Hurry up!

660
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Over there!

661
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Over there!

662
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Over there!

663
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Over there!

664
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Over there!

665
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Over there!

666
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Wu Chen,

667
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
you don't have to say anything now.

668
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
No one will believe you.

669
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Then why would you believe me?

670
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Why did you save me?

671
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
I know you haven't hurt anyone.

672
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Hurry up and run.

673
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,720
But what if I leave and Mo Xiao does?

674
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
It's already late.

675
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
You're still worried about him?

676
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
We're in the village.

677
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
We're running to the right.

678
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,720
There's a temple of the Goddess.

679
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
You go there first.

680
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
I'll tell you about the future.

681
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
I'll listen to you.

682
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
After you see Mo Xiao,

683
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
remember to let him come to me.

684
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Okay.

685
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Then you should go.

686
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Hurry up.

687
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Hua,

688
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
you're a magical girl.

689
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
You're beautiful.

690
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Hurry up and go.

691
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Hurry up.

692
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Hurry up.

693
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Hurry up and run!

694
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Hurry up!

695
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Go over there!

696
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Over there!

697
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Hurry up!

698
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Where are you going?

699
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Over there!

700
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Let's run!

701
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Go over there!

702
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Go over there!

703
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Don't let him go!

704
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,280
Sir, Sir, Sir!

705
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,580
Minister!

706
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
Moshiao reported it to Chenfleng Sect.

707
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,500
傳回信息來了

708
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,640
The Yao from Mount Shao back here.

709
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,720
Said she won't come back

710
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,760
and was attached to her Simple fulfilment.

711
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,440
That's good.

712
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,040
It's good that Ping'an is back.

713
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,200
What's wrong?

714
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,880
What else do you want?

715
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,680
Just a message from the mountain.

716
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,800
It says that the locals are discussing

717
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,800
that the ancestors of Mount Zu are protecting the demon girl.

718
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,960
Protecting the demon girl?

719
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,360
The villagers are talking about

720
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,600
the demon girl who is on the mountain.

721
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,120
But when she went down the mountain,

722
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,920
she brought a strange woman.

723
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,400
This woman is very suspicious.

724
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,040
She is the demon girl.

725
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,360
Anyone here?

726
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,560
Let's go.

727
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,720
Are you hungry again?

728
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,760
Mo Xiao.

729
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,600
I knew you would take me down the mountain.

730
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,040
You wouldn't ignore me.

731
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,080
Taking you down the mountain

732
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,200
is a responsibility.

733
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,200
I was afraid that I would miss you

734
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,560
when you were on Mount Zu.

735
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,400
I almost hurt you.

736
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,880
You know that you can't do this again.

737
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:53,440
según

738
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,520
What are you doing?

739
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,680
Boiled minced meat.

740
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
But this stove...

741
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,680
So you can't do anything about it.

742
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,680
I can't. I know Shao Shuang is going to use the stove.

743
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,680
But Zisu used to help me.

744
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,680
But I remember that's how I made it.

745
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
Let go. I'll do it.

746
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
You?

747
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
This is how you do it.

748
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Look.

749
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
It's quite simple.

750
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
What's wrong?
