00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind blows warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the fog rises

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows and the river flows

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling water is helpless

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers of life

The history is not clear

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain of another life

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If I don't let him go, what do you want?

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you don't let him go,

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
even if I let all the guards on the left side of the iron gate

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
get out of here,

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
it's good.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's good.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's good.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Listen to my command,

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
strengthen the magic spell.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Princess.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're a princess.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm just a ghost.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll come back to you and let you go.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Master.

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Master.

Master,

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,160

I like this feeling.

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,360
This pain

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,760
makes me feel

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,760
that I'm alive.

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,640
Great.

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,960

No wonder.

75

Russians,

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,240
what should we do now?

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
is to bring Him to life

No

81
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,360
He can't have anything to remind that person

82
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,280
Monster Branch purple

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,580
ebony

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,180
You called me

85
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,820
But I can only what you say

86
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Repeat

87
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,400
No

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,180
It's not your fault

89
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,080
The Lord's suit

90
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,060
Le'er

91
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,940
No one can survive today.

92
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,620
Get out of the Demon Palace

93
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,900
and lock her up in the Sword Pavilion.

94
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,940
Yes, master.

95
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,500
Let me go.

96
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,060
Master.

97
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,500
Master.

98
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,420
Wu Qian.

99
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,140
Are you handsome?

100
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:42,440
Are you a武

101
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,420
at Chinese real estate?

102
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,820
Do you have the Power

103
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,260
to kill the evil spirit

104
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,900
by attacking me?

105
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,580
I'm afraid he's been hurt by Xue Yao.

106
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,300
I'll bring him back to heal him.

107
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,260
You're still lying.

108
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,180
Tell me.

109
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,740
Why did you save him?

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,700
This girl...

111
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,540
is innocent.

112
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,420
I saved him...

113
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,820
for...

114
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,580
Tell me.

115
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
Why did you save him?

116
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,660
You've never...

117
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,220
ever lied to me.

118
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,540
You never let a Shushan back.

119
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,980
You're the only heir to the Jianzun Sect.

120
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,700
You're the hope of my future.

121
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,820
But now...

122
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,140
you forgot...

123
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,180
the fate of the Jianzun Sect...

124
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,460
for that Wu Chen.

125
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,580
I dare not forget.

126
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,700
I was born to be the one who saved the Jianzun Sect.

127
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,740
For Shushan...

128
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,940
and for the world.

129
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,700
Then why did you...

130
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,340
leave everything behind...

131
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,900
for saving him and not to risk your life?

132
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
What is this for?

133
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,140
Because of him.

134
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,180
Because of Wu Chen.

135
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,740
Because of the world.

136
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,940
Is it not because...

137
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,940
he's Feng Lixue?

138
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,060
Do you want me to leave?

139
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,820
And then?

140
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,100
Maybe you're fed up with your big brother's plot.

141
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,820
And he's dreaming of the future.

142
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
You knew it was hard to finish.

143
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
That's why you hid her here.

144
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
Did you forget?

145
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
That year, Jianzun figured out that you had a life barrier.

146
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
That's the girl.

147
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
How could I not leave?

148
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
That year, it was because of Li Xuan.

149
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
It was my fate that ended.

150
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
We were trying to stop her.

151
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
But we couldn't catch up.

152
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
It was my fault.

153
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
If I hadn't finished it,

154
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
I would have died in the Palace of Demonic Demon.

155
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
How could I face the justice of Mount Shu?

156
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
For you, for Mount Shu,

157
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
for the sake of the world,

158
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
I can't take the risk.

159
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Master, even if I was killed by Mount Shu,

160
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
I would have been responsible for it.

161
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
But you...

162
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Never forget.

163
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,820
That year, Jianzun used her life to protect you.

164
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
For what?

165
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Master.

166
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
What do you say?

167
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,820
The message from the Chief is that

168
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
he has no life problems.

169
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
But I suspect that

170
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
he will bring trouble.

171
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Did that fox bring it back?

172
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Yes.

173
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Let him in.

174
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Come in.

175
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Greetings, Master.

176
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
I have lived in Mount Shu for ten years.

177
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
I have completely become a human.

178
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
It is a standard.

179
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
But it's a pity that you can't use it.

180
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I was saved by Master.

181
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
I was given by Master.

182
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
I can practice the punishment

183
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
because I am Master's benefactor.

184
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
As long as Master needs it,

185
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
I can become anything.

186
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
I like your appearance.

187
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
Come.

188
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
Let me out!

189
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Let me out!

190
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Let me out!

191
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
Don't be afraid.

192
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
He is just a spirit.

193
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Let me out!

194
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,820
He can't hurt you.

195
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
From now on,

196
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
I want you to be his body.

197
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
From now on, you will be his body.

198
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Master,

199
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
I am just a snow fox who is on the road.

200
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
I am afraid...

201
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
I will be your life.

202
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
Master.

203
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Master.

204
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
Master.

205
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Get up.

206
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Are you hurt?

207
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
No.

208
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
It seems that I have wronged you.

209
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Since you are the daughter of the Heavenly Lord,

210
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
you are on the road to the Ice Lake.

211
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I am afraid that

212
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
the war between Qi and Han

213
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
is really a coincidence.

214
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
But that Feng Mian Yu

215
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
suddenly appeared on the road to the Ice Lake.

216
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,820
And he told the world about the world

217
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
when he opened the Heavenly Realm's secret treasure.

218
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
It's a coincidence.

219
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Master, what are you worried about?

220
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Do you remember the scene

221
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,820
where the Sword Master left before the first stone?

222
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Feng Xing Tian has been trained

223
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
from the Demon Palace of the Thousand-Globes.

224
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
But he caused the Demon Palace to be in trouble.

225
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
The Sword Master decided

226
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
to use the Demon Power to

227
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
help others to train their children

228
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
and help them to become a city.

229
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
If that is the case,

230
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
now that the Demon is in peace,

231
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Feng Mian Yu will be in trouble.

232
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
If there is someone

233
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
who is in trouble,

234
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
I am afraid that the good news

235
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
that the Sword Master said

236
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
will come.

237
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Master, let me go.

238
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Can Feng Mian Yu

239
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
really go to the Ice Lake?

240
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Or is there really someone

241
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
who is in trouble behind the back?

242
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
I will go and check it out.

243
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Mo Xiao,

244
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
remember that

245
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
the Ice Lake is your life.

246
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
You must not be responsible

247
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
for the cliff incident.

248
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Just hide the trace.

249
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Yes.

250
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
How should I go for this?

251
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
If he is like his father,

252
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
he is in the Demon Realm

253
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
and has trained the Demon Palace,

254
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
you must get rid of him.

255
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
I know.

256
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
I have ordered people to

257
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
turn off the power of the Demon Palace.

258
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Maybe

259
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
I really misled Wu Chen.

260
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,820
You go to the Demon Palace and get him out.

261
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Take him to the Anzhi.

262
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Yes.

263
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Wu Chen.

264
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Wu Chen.

265
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Wu Chen.

266
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Wu Chen.

267
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
The sword in your eyes

268
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
the sword in your heart

269
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,820
The sword in your heart

270
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Luckily, there is a purple snake

271
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,820
in the lake.

272
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
It didn't hurt you.

273
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,820
I want...

274
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Wu Chen.

275
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
I knew that you would come and save me.

276
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Luckily, I didn't hear him.

277
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
He?

278
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Who is he?

279
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,820
There is a person with a mask in the lake.

280
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
He said that the rat god will cure me and the dead.

281
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
He wants to take me away.

282
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
But I won't go.

283
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
I will wait for you.

284
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
But who is he?

285
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
He has a mask.

286
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
I can't see his face.

287
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Wu Chen.

288
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
The night is full of years.

289
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
I have to be careful.

290
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
I can't breathe.

291
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
The rain in your eyes

292
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
is waiting for me.

293
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Where are you going?

294
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
You are awake.

295
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Don't worry.

296
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
This is the Tiance Garden.

297
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
You can rest assured.

298
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,820
I will get the purple snake to cure you later.

299
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
The young master is in your back.

300
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Your back?

301
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
It's nothing.

302
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
It's just a small wound.

303
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Zisu.

304
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
Take care of Miss Wu Chen.

305
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
I should take care of the young master first.

306
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
It's okay.

307
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
I have something else to do.

308
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Take care of Wu Chen first.

309
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Where are you going?

310
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Drink it.

311
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,820
If you don't like me,

312
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
you don't have to take care of me.

313
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I am just a command of the young master.

314
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,820
It has nothing to do with whether you like me or not.

315
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
If you don't like me,

316
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
you like Mo Xiao, right?

317
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
What are you talking about?

318
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
I am the young master's guard.

319
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
I can follow him around.

320
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
This is my honor as a disciple of Mount Zu.

321
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
I don't have any personal feelings.

322
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
Your expression now

323
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
and your appearance

324
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
are especially good like my painting.

325
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,820
You think Mo Xiao will take care of me and protect me,

326
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
so you don't like me.

327
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
When I asked you just now,

328
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
you were like a ghost.

329
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,820
You dare not admit it or confess it.

330
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,820
Your heart is so slow.

331
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Look at those weird and chaotic paintings.

332
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
You learned these weird paintings.

333
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
Actually,

334
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
he knows about them.

335
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
Who?

336
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Who knows?

337
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Mo Xiao.

338
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
Mo Xiao knows about them.

339
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
But he pretended not to know.

340
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,820
It's because he didn't want you to confess.

341
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
I also think

342
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
you should not say it.

343
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,820
It's a good thing to hide it in your heart.

344
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
I want you to take care of me.

345
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,820
Why should I listen to you?

346
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Because

347
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,820
I am the one he likes.

348
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,820
His every expression is like my painting.

349
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,820
He must like me.

350
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,820
You...

351
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,820
Are you not going to give up?

352
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Feng Mian Nu.

353
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

354
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

355
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
I, Su Yuting,

356
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,820
summoned you here.

357
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,820
But I came here to show you the world.

358
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,820
It seems that

359
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
the news of the Great House

360
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
is very clear.

361
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,820
Do you have any plans?

362
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Back then,

363
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,820
my Celestial Demon Clan and the Immortal Sect fought.

364
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,820
The Celestial Demon Order was crushed in the battle.

365
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
It was drawn into three holy stones.

366
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,820
It fell under the Mount Buzhou.

367
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,820
One of them was the sacred stone of the Love Ceremony.

368
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,820
Brother Ye Yuan passed it to me.

369
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,820
The other two were the sacred stones of the Wuyen Cult.

370
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
But they were not clear.

371
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
In the news,

372
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
the Master of the Heavenly Formation, Feng Xing Tian,

373
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
has become the most important person in the world.

374
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,820
If our two sacred stones

375
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
are in the Wuyen Cult,

376
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,820
shouldn't we

377
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
invite our sacred stones here?

378
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
You have such a plan.

379
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,820
Why don't you let me go back to the sacred stone?

380
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
The Seven Stars Sect has been summoned.

381
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,820
The Immortal Sect of the Wuyen Cult is in the name of the Emperor.

382
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,820
What do you think?

383
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
You have your own plan.

384
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
We'll wait and hear from you.

385
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm just like the Immortal of the Wuyen Cult.

386
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
I'll listen to you.

387
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
If that's the case,

388
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
then fine.

389
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Chang Ming.

390
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Master, I'm here.

391
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,820
You've worked hard to go to the Wandao Ice Lake

392
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
and invite our sacred stones here.

393
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
No!

394
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Master,

395
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
the sacred stone is related to the Heavenly Formation.

396
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
It's my clan's sacred stone.

397
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,820
Chang Ming's protection law has been in my clan for more than ten years.

398
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,820
Besides, it's not my clan's.

399
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,820
I'm the one who's more suitable to bring back the sacred stone.

400
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm not from the Heavenly Formation.

401
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
As you wish.

402
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,820
I should also let the Lord know

403
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
and return it to you.

404
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Right?

405
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,820
I don't mean that.

406
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,820
I think you mean that.

407
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,820
Are you going to kill me because of this?

408
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Can't.

409
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Wait.

410
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,820
I promised Brother Yeyuan

411
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,820
not to kill you were the Demons.

412
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Don't excited.

413
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Let's go.

414
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,820
This area is a war zone.

415
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,140
It must be a border between the Immortal Sect and the pugilistic sect.

416
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,740
The Star Lord is worried that the Long-Long-Long-Hood is too weak.

417
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,340
He wants to help the Long-Long-Hood.

418
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,940
As you said,

419
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,740
the Long-Long-Hood has been with you for more than ten years.

420
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,540
It's your right arm.

421
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,260
It's the most reasonable way to get away.

422
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,540
Right?

423
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,260
The Star Lord.

424
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,980
The Star Lord of Xu Yuan is indeed the descendant of the past.

425
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,340
He speaks well and is very clear about things.

426
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,940
The Star Lord wants to learn more from the Star Lord of Xu Yuan.

427
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,620
You should be more cautious in your words.

428
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,700
If it's not my fault,

429
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,860
I'm afraid that it will hurt a lot of people's ears.

430
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,900
I respect your advice.

431
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,260
I'm sorry.

432
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,860
Wushuang has left for so long.

433
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm afraid that the fire in the Apothecary House will be re-heated.

434
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,660
I'll take my leave now.

435
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,260
Since I became the Lord of the House,

436
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,980
the Star Lord of Xu Yuan rarely participates in the clan.

437
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,900
Is it because he can't see me

438
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,500
and sits on Ye Yuan's throne?

439
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,300
The Star Lord of Xu Yuan is a father and a son.

440
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,620
He's a good man.

441
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,420
He's not the Lord of the House.

442
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,820
You're not a bad man either.

443
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,780
Are you sure?

444
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,100
Of course.

445
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,500
I have to do it myself.

446
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,420
You didn't do it because of me?

447
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,820
He has no change, no fortune, no long life.

448
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,340
He is the one who is the leader of the world.

449
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,820
There is a person in the world who is wearing a mask.

450
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,940
He said that Shushan wanted to kill me.

451
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,980
He wanted to take me away.

452
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,460
Is he the same person?

453
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,580
But how could he break into the Fukuoka Palace?

454
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
It's impossible.

455
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,500
Shushan.

456
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:24,780
You...

457
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,820
Please.

458
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,860
Master.

459
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,800
looks like there are some move on

460
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,980
The three sacred stones of the Demon Clan.

461
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,780
Two of them are out of the world.

462
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,300
The only one that loves the sacred stone

463
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,220
is in my hand.

464
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,140
They've been red-eyed for so many years.

465
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,980
Now they finally get the news of one of them.

466
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,140
Of course, they have their actions.

467
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,340
Then, do you want to stop them?

468
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,700
No need.

469
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,340
We also need to find the three sacred stones.

470
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,980
As long as they don't fall into chaos,

471
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,140
we can take them with us.

472
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,980
As long as the three sacred stones of the Demon Clan

473
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
are out of the world,

474
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,540
we can complete the wish of the Lord

475
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,700
at that time.

476
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,100
By the way,

477
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,860
we need to find the blood of the Night Circle

478
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,980
to return to the sacred stone.

479
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Changming, you've been with me for so many years.

480
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,900
You need to remind me

481
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
what you should know and what you shouldn't know.

482
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,300
I know my mistake.

483
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,140
I'm going to Wan Dao Ice Lake

484
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,460
to find the sacred stone for you.

485
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,460
Go ahead.

486
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,620
This time, it's a good chance

487
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,380
to go down the mountain.

488
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,220
It's also a good chance to practice.

489
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,260
I...

490
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,980
I'd better not go.

491
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,140
Why?

492
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,500
I've been working on the responsibility

493
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,980
of guarding the four gates of the Shushan Sect.

494
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,140
I rarely attend to

495
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,420
any other sects besides the four gates.

496
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,060
I'm more likely to be in contact with the sect leaders.

497
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,580
I don't want to be a brother to my sect.

498
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,420
I'm afraid I'll be offended by the sect leaders.

499
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,140
You're a very

500
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,060
good-looking young master.

501
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,060
You're also one of the four gates of the Shushan Sect.

502
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,460
Why do you care about

503
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,020
the rumors and rumors about others?

504
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,500
Where are you going, Mo Xiao?

505
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,220
I'm not going there.

506
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,620
Father, I'm not going there.

507
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,860
Do you want me to go there?

508
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,700
They've practiced all the mountain practice.

509
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,500
I've never been to any place.

510
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,180
Do you know where you're going this time?

511
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,260
The mountain is important this time.

512
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,940
This trip is not more than a long trip.

513
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,540
You'll have to go there to help your mother.

514
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,340
You should practice your Baotar Bell well.

515
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,980
When you're done with the training,

516
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,220
I promise you

517
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,340
I'll take you to the mountain to enjoy the world.

518
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,660
Father,

519
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,260
the young master's trip to the mountain

520
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,740
is just to find out the truth.

521
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,940
But when I'm in the Shushan,

522
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,660
I'll be the chief of the Fengyu Sect.

523
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,620
I'll definitely not let the young master fight in the mountain.

524
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,580
But before that,

525
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,940
I'd better not go there.

526
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,220
I'd better go there.

527
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,660
Father,

528
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,700
I want to see you.

529
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,300
Really?

530
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,220
These are all my mind.

531
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,300
Enjoy it.

532
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,940
You two

533
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,020
don't want me to don't you?

534
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,460
I'm sure

535
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,660
Dad, tell me where you want to go.

536
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,660
You can't go anywhere. Stay at home.

537
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,060
Dad, what else?

538
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,060
You won't tell me?

539
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,460
I'll find it myself.

540
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,020
Who is

541
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,260
the DD frog in the cave?

542
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,660
DD

543
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,740
Love

544
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,260
THESE ARE THE F pull the horn

545
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,260
FOR WHICH GAME

546
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,060
Why there is a hat on the floor?

547
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,660
They are all long round

548
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,380
Go

549
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,140
Who are you

550
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,580
Who are you

551
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,940
I am Wuchen

552
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,260
I am the famous Young Master of the?」!

553
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,460
You are the demon that Brother Mo Xiao brought back from Mount Mang.

554
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,860
You must be a orphan.

555
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,860
We grew up together in Mount Shu.

556
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,060
Of course, it's good that you're happy.

557
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,860
But Mo Xiao said that he has been training in Xuan Qingyue.

558
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,460
You are also...

559
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,860
You are the one who is responsible for it.

560
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Why should we tell you about Mount Shu?

561
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,060
Where is Brother Mo Xiao? I'll go find him.

562
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,460
You like him.

563
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,860
You like him, right?

564
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,660
What are you talking about?

565
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
You are very obvious.

566
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,460
You want to show something special in him.

567
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,660
But I'd better go and let you go.

568
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Otherwise, you will be very sad.

569
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,260
I don't understand what you are talking about.

570
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
What are you giving up?

571
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,260
What are you talking about?

572
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,860
I am the one he likes.

573
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
You?

574
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,460
Yes.

575
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
You...

576
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,660
You are really not a bad girl.

577
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,860
It seems that it's really troublesome for you to give up.

578
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,460
Brother Mo Xiao.

579
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,260
Brother Mo Xiao.

580
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,260
The...

581
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,260
Get out of my way.

582
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,860
This is my seat.

583
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
I sit here every day in the garden.

584
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,860
Get out of my way.

585
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,060
But Mo Xiao taught me to read and write.

586
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,660
They are all here.

587
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,660
This is my seat.

588
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
Mo Xiao.

589
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Right?

590
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,660
Brother Mo Xiao.

591
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,060
Look at him.

592
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,060
He finally came here.

593
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,860
Ling Ling.

594
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,060
You came just in time.

595
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
You are so polite.

596
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,460
Every time I come to the garden,

597
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
I sit here.

598
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,460
Why do you let him sit here?

599
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,860
Did you forget what you came here for?

600
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Brother Mo Xiao.

601
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,860
You want to take me to the Ice Lake?

602
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Mo Xiao.

603
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
You are going out again?

604
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Young Master.

605
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,660
I want to ask you to come over.

606
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Coming.

607
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Brother Mo Xiao.

608
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,660
You want to promise me first?

609
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,660
Mo Xiao is here.

610
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Master.

611
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
Uncle.

612
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Brother Mo.

613
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,660
You are the one who should be the master.

614
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
Okay.

615
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Mo Xiao.

616
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
I just received news from the Feng Lv Sect.

617
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
In the capital,

618
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
the old department of the Yuan Tianxing Sect

619
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,660
has started to have a new record.

620
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Especially Feng Xingtian.

621
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
He was killed by the guards.

622
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,660
I'm afraid that this is a cause

623
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,660
for me to be killed.

624
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
I will get ready to leave the city.

625
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,660
I will do my best to stop him.

626
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Okay.

627
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Okay.

628
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Jing.

629
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,660
The guard is not here.

630
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
You go and sit.

631
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
No need.

632
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
The master doesn't want to let me go.

633
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
I won't fight with you.

634
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,660
Anyway, I'm going to go to the Ice Lake with Brother Mo Xiao.

635
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,660
I'll sit with you.

636
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
It's okay.

637
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
He will take me out.

638
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
Take you.

639
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,660
You will not help other than scaring people.

640
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,660
What do you do with me?

641
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
You don't understand.

642
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,660
But if you just help me,

643
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,660
you are my friend and my brother.

644
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,660
I'm saying, Wu Chen.

645
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,660
I'm afraid that you will be bored

646
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
in the Xuanqing House

647
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
and give you time to use it.

648
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
I didn't expect that you would learn it quickly.

649
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
Why do you use it in my life?

650
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Exactly.

651
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,660
You also believe in the things in the painting.

652
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
You are so...

653
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
Guo Jing.

654
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,660
I'm not afraid that you will trouble me.

655
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Mo Xiao.

656
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,660
Don't be anxious.

657
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,660
I'll go and take a look.

658
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,660
Mo Xiao.

659
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,660
Is something wrong?

660
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Is there still no news from the stone lake?

661
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,660
It should be just a few days.

662
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,660
Can't wait?

663
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
I'm afraid that I can't wait.

664
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,660
The situation is urgent.

665
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,660
I must get up and go to the Ice Lake.

666
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,660
Okay. I'll go with you.

667
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,660
You can't go.

668
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,660
Why?

669
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,660
Aren't we brothers?

670
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,660
Last time you went to Mount Mang,

671
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,660
you were in a hurry to go to the night.

672
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
I don't care.

673
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,660
You have to take me with you no matter what you say.

674
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
Master ordered me to take the Three Lakes Law

675
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
to lower the mountain.

676
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,660
Can I take you with me?

677
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
You are so thoughtful.

678
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Who is more suitable for you

679
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,660
to be the guide of your mountain training?

680
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,660
No.

681
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,660
We have other things to do.

682
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,660
What is it?

683
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
Take care of Wu Chen.

684
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Me again?

685
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
You forgot to give him the gift last time.

686
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,660
What's the result?

687
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
You still trust me.

688
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,660
So this time,

689
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
you can do it.

690
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
Fine.

691
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
I'm afraid that I'm wrong.

692
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,660
How about you take him with you?

693
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,660
No.

694
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
I'm not well-behaved this time.

695
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,660
I'm going to visit

696
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
the people who have been buried in the Sky Land

697
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
and re-established the human world.

698
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
It's not necessary to take Wu Chen with you.

699
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,660
Then you can keep him in the Sky Land.

700
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
He is still in the hospital.

701
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,660
I'll keep him in the hospital.

702
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
It's not necessary to take him to the hospital.

703
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
Who told you to bring trouble back?

704
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,660
How about

705
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,660
we call him Murong Jing?

706
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Look.

707
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,660
I'm going with you

708
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
to visit the people who have been buried in the Sky Land.

709
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,660
No one is here.

710
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
At least I'm a girl.

711
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
It's not convenient to take care of Wu Chen.

712
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,660
Young Master Xie.

713
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
You are afraid that

714
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
you will be in trouble.

715
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
Look at them.

716
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
No.

717
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,660
You two

718
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
are not in a fight?

719
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
No.

720
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,660
I'm not in a fight.

721
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660
I'm not in a fight.

722
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,660
You are not in a fight?

723
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,660
What's the secret idea

724
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,660
of Xie Lingyun?

725
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
We said we would go to Wan Dao Ice Lake together.

726
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,660
You are trying to

727
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
betray me for your own sake.

728
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
No.

729
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,660
I'm doing this for your own good.

730
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,660
It's for my own good.

731
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
You are not good enough.

732
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,660
How can you not understand?

733
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,660
You, come down.

734
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
You have heard

735
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,660
what I said to him.

736
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,660
I have heard it all.

737
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,660
You are going to leave me alone again.

738
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Mo Xiao.

739
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
It's already the third time.

740
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Do you really think

741
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
I'm in trouble?

742
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,660
I've never thought you are in trouble.

743
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,660
I've said it all.

744
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
It's just three times.

745
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,660
The first two times.

746
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,660
Maybe it's because of the difficulty.

747
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
But if there is a third time,

748
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,660
do you really want to leave me alone?

749
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
No.

750
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Who do you think you are talking about?

751
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
Don't interrupt the topic.

752
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,660
If you really think I'm in trouble,

753
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
just tell me.

754
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,660
I'll leave.

755
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,660
I didn't.

756
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
I've never thought you are in trouble.

757
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Wu Chen.

758
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Actually, I first brought you to Shushan

759
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
just to cure your cold.

760
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
When I found the doctor

761
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
to cure your cold,

762
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
I would send you down the mountain

763
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,660
to find a cure for your cold.

764
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
I've never said

765
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
I would take you to the江湖 for travel.

766
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
Okay.

767
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,660
I understand.

768
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
Anyway,

769
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
everything is for me to leave.

770
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
You are not in Shushan.

771
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
I don't need to stay here.

772
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Then I'll leave.

773
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,660
I'll leave now.

774
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,660
No.

775
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Wu Chen.

776
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,660
No.

777
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
The painting is not blood.

778
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,660
If I cut it like this,

779
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,660
he will come after me.

780
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Brother Mo Xiao won't take us there.

781
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
What should we do?

782
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
I don't want to go to the shanghai.

783
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

784
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
I don't want to go to the shanghai.

785
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
I don't want to go to the shanghai.

786
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,660
I don't want to go to the shanghai.

787
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
I don't want to go to the shanghai.

788
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
What should we do?

789
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,660
He doesn't want to take you there.

790
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,660
But he will take me there.

791
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
Why would he take you there?

792
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I'm the young master Xie.

793
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,660
It's a good old man.

794
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
It's not useful to take me there.

795
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
You are a big lady.

796
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
And you will get the news.

797
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
You won't do anything else.

798
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
It's a trouble to take you there.

799
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,660
Do you understand?

800
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
I'm a young master.

801
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Why do you have no idea?

802
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,660
Do you want to compete with me?

803
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,660
I'm a young master Xie.

804
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,660
I'm a young master Xie.

805
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,660
I'm a young master Xie.

806
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,660
I'm a young master Xie.

807
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
I'm a young master Xie.

00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
I'm a young master Xie.

809
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,660
I'm a young master Xie.

810
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
I'm a young master Xie.

811
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,660
I'm a young master Xie.

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,660
I'm a young master Xie.

00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
I'm a young master Xie.

00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,660
I'm a young master Xie.

00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,660
I'm a young master Xie.

00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
I'm a young master Xie.

817
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Look at a sudden encouragement.

You are a singer

My career is more sustainable

826
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,660
I don't want to wake up

827
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,660
The sun is shining

828
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,160
I want to wait for the cold

829
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,660
I want to walk around the world

I want to be with you
