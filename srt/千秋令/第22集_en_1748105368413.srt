1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Flower petals bloom in the wind and warm

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Always give up, don't kneel, do not go to the wind, go to the river

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Falling, flowing, water, and no shadow

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is the flower of life, like a dream, like you

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Always, thousands of years, no words, no breath

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The history is not clear

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain of another life

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 1

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Master

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to the secret room to make a secret letter to Chang Mi to protect her

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Take good care of her

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Master

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why are you here?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
She is full of blood

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She can't stay in the body for a day

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Otherwise, the war is over

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can't face the suffering of the mortal world

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your hard work may not be understood

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The years are endless

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Only she can accompany me forever

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
One day, she will understand

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Master

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Feng Mingxu

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You have a bad luck

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't deserve the love of Master

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You must kill Master

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You should go to hell

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mo Xiao

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now you are under the whole of the Mount Suyu

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How dare you come to the Five-star Palace?

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you dare to shout, the dagger will be killed

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I will break your good luck

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You just saved her

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you know she is willing to do it?

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are a fool

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You are the fool who was killed by Feng Lixue

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She is the same as Chong Guang

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You think Feng Lixue is so sacred

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The Mount Suyu is 3000 meters high

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She is the most concerned about Chong Guang

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't think I dare not kill you

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can kill me

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But you can't take her away even if you kill me

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Because she won't go with you

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If I were you

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I would kill her if I can't get her

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because you are not me

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The Mount Suyu

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How is it, Jing'er?

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is it better?

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What happened to her?

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She was hit by the Lotus Thread Embroidery

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I was trying to get the information about Jing'er

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I was so scared

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why are you two here?

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
She is here

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's important to solve the problem

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We should go back

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Huayun

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They are here

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Huayun

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This is not a place to talk

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Get in the car

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jing'er

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How are you feeling?

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I am fine

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Where are my father and uncle?

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Uncle Shibao was injured in the Mount Suyu

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My father and uncle Xie were sent back to Mount Suyu

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will suggest you and the young masters to go with them

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You two are so good at fighting

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You two are so naughty

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are so good at fighting

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You are so good at fighting

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Luckily nothing happened

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If something goes wrong

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't want to take the blame

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I know

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I am wrong

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I am wrong

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What are you thinking about?

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Nothing

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do the young masters still have news?

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Didn't you say she would keep going?

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why didn't she come back with you?

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She needs to know about the mountain

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
She will go to the Shaman School in the future

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
to know about the world

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Jing'er

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Take care of your wound

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I will go to meet the doctor

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
You should rest well first.

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
I'll go and check on Young Master.

115
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,960
Young Master Xie,

116
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,560
Zi Feng and Zi Mu have gone to the forest and mountain to wait for Young Master.

117
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,360
I'd better go there myself and be more at ease.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm going to go to the forest and mountain.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When I get out of the barrier, I can't be at ease.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you for helping me.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You don't have to thank me.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You helped me.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You helped me.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's Li Xue.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The plan will be in vain.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why do you still want to help her?

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because she is the only friend I have on this mountain.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm not going to let her go.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll go to the forest and mountain.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
She is also the only friend.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
She has a friend like you.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
She is worthy of that.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You must tell her about this when she wakes up.

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Actually, the first time I saw her,

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I knew that she is not as stupid as she is.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Take her away.

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The more you look at her, the better.

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But I have a condition.

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Tell me.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Take good care of her.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I tell you.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you take good care of her,

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I will go to you.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are the chief of Chu.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are very good looking.

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't worry.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I won't let you look for me.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Where is she?

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Miss Mo took her away.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm lucky.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Xuezi is willing to leave with Mo Xiao.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
She attacked me.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm not against it.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
My thing

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
will not allow anyone to take her away.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Even if she can't use her poison as much as I can.

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Who do you think you are?

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Who?

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Mo Xiao

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I've kept you a life.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You should return to your mountain of trees.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How dare you take away my phoenix snow?

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're too weak to lose it.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
As long as I'm alive,

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I won't let the snow stay in the Demon Realm and use it.

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you think you can take it away today?

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do you think you can keep it?

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Strange...

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The Devil Lord?

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,800
No, it's not your fault.

172
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
Mo YT!

173
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,680
Yin Xue.

174
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Yin Xue.

175
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,480
My lady.

176
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,920
My lady.

177
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,320
Don't move.

178
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,120
Go.

179
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,440
My lady,

180
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
the friction inside your body has worked harder

181
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,480
It's getting harder.

182
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,840
Don't be soStep

183
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,080
I should be.

184
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,160
My lady.

185
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,840
The sher mob.

186
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,520
I fear

187
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,360
it'll be time for the purple ice tone

188
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
in not losing college students.

189
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,900
The time still

190
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,720
is high.

191
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,680
My lady.

192
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,200
It's just that your

193
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,520
interior is all

194
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,320
He's just a container for you to put in the spirit.

195
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,720
You've learned to work hard to be with him.

196
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,320
Isn't it just for today?

197
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,520
The Purple Ice Manor has already been renovated.

198
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Master, what are you hesitating about?

199
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Shut up!

200
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,520
Changming, you're so bold.

201
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I...

202
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,720
Li Xue is my son-in-law.

203
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,920
How should I use it?

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,520
It's not your turn to teach me.

205
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,120
Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,720
I need to close the door for three days.

207
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
Within three days, no one will disturb me.

208
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,720
I'll give this to him.

209
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,320
Look at him.

210
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,920
Without my order,

211
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
you can't leave Suyu Mountain.

212
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,320
Yes.

213
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,120
Cuiying, send this medicine to Feng Li Xue.

214
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,520
And, you must take good care of him.

215
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,120
Yes.

216
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
This is the medicine that you gave to me.

217
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,720
You're already in a good position.

218
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,120
You'd better be self-aware.

219
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,520
You should reflect on yourself in the Shao Hao Palace.

220
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Feng Li Xue, you're not a good person.

221
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
You're the one who was hurt.

222
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,120
If you have any issues,

223
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,320
even if you die a thousand times, you'll be punished.

224
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,320
Let me tell you.

225
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,520
If you dare to do anything to our Lady again,

226
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
I'll kill you.

227
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,920
I'm here to give you the medicine.

228
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,320
And you dare to touch me.

229
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
The owner is your owner.

230
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
My master is the only one who is our Lady.

231
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,120
What? Do you want to try it?

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,720
I dare to kill you?

233
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
No. Let her go.

234
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,520
Let me tell you.

235
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,120
From now on, without our Lady's permission,

236
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,120
you must enter the Shao Hao Palace again.

237
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,920
Do you understand?

238
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,520
Get out!

239
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,920
Young Master Jing and Young Master Xie are back for so long.

240
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,320
Why hasn't Young Master Chen come to see the body?

241
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Nothing will happen, right?

242
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
Don't talk nonsense.

243
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,920
Young Master Chen has broken the magic barrier.

244
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,720
What else can we do? Let's wait a little longer.

245
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,120
Young Master Jing and Young Master Xie are back.

246
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,520
Young Master Jing and Young Master Xie are back.

247
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,120
Let's wait a little longer.

248
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,720
Young Master Jing and Young Master Chen are back.

249
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Let's wait a little longer.

250
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,920
Young Master Jing and Young Master Xie are back.

251
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,880
He has helped Baku Binvan

252
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,680
겨 company grow up

253
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
How could he own out his power?

254
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
No milk

255
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
It happens

256
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,160
I filmed when his service in Shanghai

257
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,840
he said he worked hard

258
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,440
Boss

259
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,240
What are you saying?

260
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,460
But, why did your sister cut the car cause yourself?

261
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,840
Ban �ology

262
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,540
Theolar lotus

263
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,620
Hi

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,040
Hi

265
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,620
I think, l can help you

266
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,720
can only get to doctor here

267
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Zi Feng, Zi Mo.

268
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,640
Young Master, Young Master Xie, why are you here?

269
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Where's Mo Xiao? Is he still not here?

270
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,240
Young Master Xie, are you sure he's fine?

271
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
Didn't you say he'd be here any minute?

272
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,240
Why haven't you seen him for so long?

273
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,640
Yes, Young Master.

274
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
Are you hiding something from us?

275
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Your head is reacting very fast this time.

276
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,640
I don't want to know if your Young Master will be able to save Feng Li Xue.

277
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,640
What? Why didn't you stop him, Young Master Xie?

278
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,840
Feng Li Xue is right by the Demon Lord's side.

279
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
The Sect Leader's door broke into the Su Yu Hall.

280
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,040
He must have already angered the Demon Lord.

281
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,840
He still didn't dare to leave the body. He even saved that demon girl.

282
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,640
That's right, Young Master. You didn't stop the Sect Leader's door.

283
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
You two are using my instructions.

284
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,440
Can you stop the Sect Leader's door if you say you can?

285
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,240
That's right.

286
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,840
Mo Xiao!

287
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,840
Mo Xiao!

288
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,640
Mo Xiao!

289
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,840
Mo Xiao!

290
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Mo Xiao!

291
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Mo Xiao!

292
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Mo Xiao!

293
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Mo Xiao!

294
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Mo Xiao!

295
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Mo Xiao!

296
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Mo Xiao!

297
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Mo Xiao!

298
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Mo Xiao!

299
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Mo Xiao!

300
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Mo Xiao!

301
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Mo Xiao!

302
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Mo Xiao!

303
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,440
Mo Xiao, what's wrong with him?

304
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,240
What are you doing, Murong?

305
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,040
Still not telling the truth? What exactly did Mo Xiao do?

306
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,640
To tell you the truth, he called Feng Li Xue.

307
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,040
Feng Li Xue? That demon girl?

308
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Mo Xiao, he...

309
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,440
Enough! What has he been hurt?

310
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,040
The most important thing right now is to save him.

311
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,240
We'll talk about it when he wakes up.

312
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,240
Oh right, even though you Feng Yu Sect is sending out news,

313
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
don't let this news spread to the Su Shang.

314
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,840
You're still trying to fool him? This isn't a trick.

315
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,040
But he indeed went to break the Su Yu Hall.

316
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,440
He was the one who saved Feng Li Xue after he cut off the Gu's position.

317
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,640
He also knew that the leader of the same sect was in danger.

318
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,640
But he didn't even care about this. He only cared about the future.

319
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,240
What are you still doing, Young Master of Mount Zu?

320
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,040
Murong Se, I don't like what you said.

321
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,240
What's wrong?

322
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,840
Does the Young Master of Mount Zu have to exist in your eyes?

323
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,640
Can't you be a little bit more emotional?

324
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,840
Are you still a human being?

325
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,040
Although we are from the sect, we don't have the right to break the love.

326
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,840
But Feng Li Xue is a demon girl.

327
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,240
Mo Xiao, you must not fall in love with her.

328
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,840
Murong Se, you're already over twenty.

329
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,040
Do you have someone you like?

330
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,040
I'm telling you the truth. What are you saying?

331
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,240
No wonder you never fell in love.

332
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
So you won't understand.

333
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,440
Whether you can break the love or not is not a matter at all.

334
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,440
Master.

335
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Did you bring the things?

336
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,640
I brought them.

337
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,040
Master.

338
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,640
Since Yu Gu came back, you've been taking the medicine on the mountain every day.

339
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
You've been working hard to be with Master.

340
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,840
Master, you've worked hard.

341
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,040
You're younger than us.

342
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,840
You're the best at learning.

343
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,840
You're the only one who comes to visit us often.

344
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,040
Yes.

345
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,240
Enough.

346
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,040
You all use your skills to be grateful.

347
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Master will be happy for you.

348
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,640
Okay.

349
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,840
I heard that this time, Yu Gu was able to solve the demon poison by Master.

350
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,440
He only broke into the mountain and fell into the rain.

351
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
He only came back safely with the same disciples.

352
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,040
Master is really good.

353
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
That's right.

354
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,240
If it weren't for Master,

355
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,440
how many of the disciples would have been demonized by Mo Xiao?

356
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,040
I heard that even the master's hand is poisoned.

357
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,440
So even if Master is not the master's hand,

358
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,840
the position of the master is also a waste.

359
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,840
Master.

360
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,440
Master, are you okay?

361
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm fine.

362
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,040
Master, don't listen to them.

363
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,640
They don't even have a mountain to go down.

364
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,240
They're just as dangerous as being in the Aiyu Valley.

365
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
But they all heard the story and fell into the river.

366
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
That's right, Master.

367
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,840
The three of us are deeply in love with each other.

368
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
But we're determined to be loyal to each other.

369
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,240
We're going to be loyal to each other.

370
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm sure that we'll be loyal to each other.

371
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm sure that we'll be loyal to each other.

372
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Master, we're going to be loyal to each other.

373
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,640
Master, what's the matter?

374
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Master, we're determined to be loyal to each other.

375
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,240
We're not demonized by each other.

376
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
Besides, we're helping everyone to save so many Martial Souls.

377
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
We're also a good friend of the Aiyu City.

378
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
That's right.

379
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,040
Okay, take the medicine back.

380
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,440
I'll be back soon.

381
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Master, you're...

382
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,040
Hurry up.

383
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,040
Stop.

384
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,240
Come here.

385
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,040
Do you know why I let you kneel here?

386
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,040
I helped Li Xue and Mo Xiao to escape from the Yushan.

387
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,440
I taught them to hurt their mother.

388
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
You're not my biological daughter.

389
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,640
You're not Ye Yuan's blood.

390
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,240
So she's in pain.

391
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,240
You can't put it in your heart, right?

392
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,840
It's not like that.

393
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm just being jealous of my friend's will.

394
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,640
I can't stand it.

395
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,840
But besides that,

396
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,640
all I did was to help my mother find my brother.

397
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
I did what my mother wanted.

398
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
What I wanted?

399
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
You know that I'm just two new friends.

400
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,040
I helped Ye Yuan to avenge your brother.

401
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,240
I was wrong.

402
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I was punished by my mother.

403
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,040
Of course you were punished.

404
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
If it weren't for my Yulin Palace,

405
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
even Chong Guang wouldn't have been able to move.

406
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Do you think you can still kneel here in peace?

407
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
But if I don't punish you,

408
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Chong Guang and Tian Mo will be punished.

409
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
How will you treat my Yulin Palace?

410
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
I'll go to the prison to take action.

412
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I'll face the death penalty.

413
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Do you really want to go to the prison to take action?

414
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Since you're guilty, you can punish me.

415
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
This medicine...

416
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,040
You must take six times a day and take half a day each.

417
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,040
You must take it twice a day each.

418
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
You must be careful.

419
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
You must be accurate in taking the medicine.

420
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
You must be careful.

421
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Understand?

422
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Yes.

423
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Junior.

424
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Junior, stay here.

425
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Senior, you go first.

426
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Senior, you're here to see the sect leader, right?

427
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Yes.

428
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Sect leader has been suffering from such a serious injury for so many years.

429
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm really worried about him.

430
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
And the wind and rain are coming.

431
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,040
The sect leader is suffering from the injury in the Demon School now.

432
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
He's recuperating in the original land.

433
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Now it's the autumn of the mountain of Shu.

434
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I really can't rest assured.

435
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Why?

436
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Don't you trust my medical skills?

437
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Junior, what are you talking about?

438
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Junior, you've been managing the mountain for years.

439
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
And you've got the true legend of the county.

440
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
These years, you've been doing well.

441
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
You've been doing well.

442
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Although you're not fully recovered,

443
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
you've been doing well.

444
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,040
I can't rest assured if you're here to help him.

445
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Then, Senior,

446
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,040
are you worried about Zisu?

447
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,040
A few days ago, I came here with the wind and rain.

448
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,040
I didn't say anything, but I was just safe.

449
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
I was talking about the rain.

450
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
I was worried that these children,

451
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
they were young,

452
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
and they were not good at handling matters.

453
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
And there was some trouble.

454
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
I'm very stable.

455
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Besides, Mo Xiao is here.

456
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
There shouldn't be anything wrong.

457
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Senior, don't worry too much.

458
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Master! Master!

459
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Why are you panicking?

460
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,040
The sect leader suddenly got confused after the medicine.

461
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
What?

462
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Go and have a look.

463
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Senior.

464
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Senior.

465
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Senior.

466
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
How is Senior?

467
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Didn't you say that after the medicine,

468
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
he's getting better?

469
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Why is he confused again?

470
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Senior.

471
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Senior.

472
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
He was poisoned.

473
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Poisoned?

474
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
That's right.

475
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
That's right.

476
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
If I remember correctly,

477
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
the poison was written on the ancient books.

478
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
It was not even poisoned.

479
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,040
This poison has been growing in the area of the Sha Qi Qi.

480
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
The people who poisoned this poison

481
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
will gradually be swallowed.

482
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
The whole person will gradually appear

483
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
and become a fool.

484
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
The area of the Sha Qi Qi?

485
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Could it be that this poison came from the Buddhism?

486
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Why would there be a poison from the Buddhism?

487
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
What if there is a person from the Buddhism

488
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
who got us into the Sha Qi Qi?

489
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
That's impossible.

490
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Zisu.

491
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
The young master has been unconscious for so long.

492
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Why is it still not working?

493
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Did your medicine really work?

494
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
The master jumped from the Bai Cao Gate to Zisu.

495
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
It was also the best in Bai Cao Gate.

496
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
He said it was fine.

497
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Then it must be fine.

498
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
I'm just worried about the young master.

499
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Zisu.

500
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Zisu.

501
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Zisu.

502
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Zisu.

503
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Zisu.

504
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Zisu.

505
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Zisu.

506
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Zisu.

507
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Mu Xiao.

508
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
What's wrong, Mu Xiao?

509
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Nothing. I've taken the medicine.

510
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
I'll come back in one night.

511
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Zisu.

512
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Zisu.

513
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Zisu.

514
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Master.

515
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
The master got poisoned by the flower.

516
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
He's unconscious in the mountain.

517
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Master.

518
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Zisu.

519
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
What are you thinking about?

520
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Nothing.

521
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Are you worried about the young master's injury?

522
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
I always think that the young master's injury is a bit strange.

523
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
It seems that there is some kind of magic power.

524
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
It seems that there is some kind of magic power.

525
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Magic power?

526
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
If the young master's hand is touched by the devil,

527
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
and the demon's hand is hurt,

528
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
then it's normal that he's touching the magic power in his body.

529
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Then it's normal that he's touching the magic power in his body.

530
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
It should be like this.

531
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Something bad happened to the mountain.

532
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Something bad happened to the mountain.

533
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

534
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Master got poisoned by someone.

535
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
His father passed out.

536
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
But Brother Mo Xiao is unconscious.

537
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
How can we go back to the mountain?

538
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
You're right.

539
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Now that Master got poisoned,

540
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
we can't let him know about the injury.

541
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
How about this?

542
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
You and Sanhu Fa will go back to the mountain first.

543
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
It's too obvious.

544
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
I'll go back after Mo Xiao wakes up.

545
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I have to stay and take care of the young master.

546
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
We'll stay too.

547
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
It's good.

548
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
I'll go back to the mountain first.

549
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
If you have any news,

550
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
let us know.

551
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
It's not fair.

552
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
I'll go and see Brother Mo Xiao.

553
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
No need.

554
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
He's gone.

555
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
He's gone?

556
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
I'll go find the antidote to save Li Xue.

557
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Wait for me at the mountain.

558
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
When did he know?

559
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
The young master is going to find the antidote for the young master.

560
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Why didn't you tell me?

561
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
He said he would go to find Feng Lin Xu.

562
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I'll explain it to you.

563
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
He has a legend.

564
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
So his news won't be better than Feng Lin Xu.

565
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
He left when I was asleep.

566
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I didn't tell him.

567
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
It's because of this that I didn't let the mountain know.

568
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
And I didn't want to let the young master know.

569
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
What should we do now?

570
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Wait.

571
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
It's you.

572
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
It seems that there's nothing to misunderstand.

573
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
You lied to me.

574
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
I'm sorry.

576
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
I'm sorry.

577
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I'm sorry.

578
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
I'm sorry.

579
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
I'm sorry.

580
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm sorry.

581
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
I'm sorry.

583
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
I'm sorry.

584
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm sorry.

585
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
You lied to me.

586
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Feng Lin Xu.

587
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
The ancestral hall was destroyed.

588
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
The imperial jade was destroyed.

589
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
All the people in the imperial jade mountain

590
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
are all the same.

591
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
You colluded with the mountain.

592
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
You ruined the sacred qi of the Tianmu Clan.

593
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
You have no way to win.

594
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Today,

595
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
I will definitely put you in the Tianmu Garden.

596
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
I will definitely split you.

597
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
It seems that you want to take the master's life.

598
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Kill me.

599
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
My dear masters.

600
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
You are really a great person.

601
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Cut the crap.

602
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
You colluded with the traitor of the mountain.

603
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
You have no way to win.

604
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
You have no way to win.

605
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,040
You should have saved me.

606
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
Are you all right?

607
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Huisun Residence

608
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Meet me at Chongguang.

609
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,520
all of you have to die here in recent years.

610
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Master.

611
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
What is it?

612
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,040
It may look like in the future.

613
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
He is good in every aspect.

614
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,600
Why is üuperень Someone eschewed

615
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,540
She dosen't want to increase the time

616
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,420
Afraid of losing Yan

617
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:42,400
Forreating wrist

618
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,700
I Aku

619
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
on the ground?

620
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,060
Yes.

621
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,060
Miss Disha is in a bad mood today.

622
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
She is weak.

623
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,780
No.

624
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,860
I was just attacked by Xu Yuanwu

625
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
and the Emperor of the People's Emperor.

626
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,380
I was in the wrong place.

627
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,300
What?

628
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,580
They almost threw me into the Sky Garden.

629
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,860
But an old witch saved me.

630
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,260
Have you seen this person?

631
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,100
Old witch?

632
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,340
No.

633
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,860
We didn't have such an old witch in the Shao Hao Palace.

634
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,540
Miss.

635
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,220
It's fine.

636
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,860
Save the stress.

637
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,940
Just go back first.

638
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,420
Miss, are you really okay?

639
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,180
I am.

640
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,180
That's for sure.

641
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,140
In order to enjoy safety...

642
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,660
You want to seeomme?

643
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,180
That depends on you.

644
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,900
I can't trust him.

645
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,540
I just want you...

646
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,380
Come with me.

647
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,780
I promised to go with you.

648
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,580
You always wish for it.

649
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,740
Give up.

650
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,940
Give up?

651
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,300
You've already told me to give up so easily.

652
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,060
Did all the demons we've experienced

653
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,260
tell me to give up?

654
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,180
Can I give up if I tell you to give up?

655
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,420
What else?

656
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,500
There won't be any results.

657
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,500
It's meaningless to tell them.

658
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,660
What do you mean?

659
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,820
Hurry up.

660
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,340
I'll find out.

661
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,580
I think

662
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,420
I must keep my father's real death.

663
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,020
I can't leave with you.

664
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,860
Actually, I came here

665
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,680
to find something else.

666
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,260
What is it?

667
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,780

Yes.

671
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,140
I know it.

672
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,540
I only did nothing good in thisysł.

673
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,940
shot specify

674
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,280

Wu Xiao.

676
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,860
Miss.

677
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,820
Tian Qing Chu.

678
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,760
Chuan

679
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,820

682
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,520

Chuan

684
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,460
Then I eat it

685
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,260
Then I could say

686
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,520
I eat

687
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,240
===

688
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,980
I should say

689
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,460
I feel clumsy

690
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,840
and bring some trouble

691
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,420
in Man Assistant City

692
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,260
Well said

693
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,600
what has happened

694
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,800
is where there was no Qi Han

695
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,840
at that time

696
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,680
some people practiced Kung Fu in the cave

697
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,460
Hey, what a waste.

698
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,920
Do you know

699
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,580
From child poking happily

700
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,600
at the Franco guns

701
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,400
I'm afraid of the Qi Han

702
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,000
that serve as a lot

703
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,200
uh

704
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,760
can not use the magic

705
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,260
for enemies

706
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,260
If she's locked up for a few days,

707
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,260
she'll suffer from the pain of the Qi Han's every day.

708
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
How can she be recovered?

709
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,260
Tian Xin, tell me directly.

710
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
How can I help her?

711
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
Master Hui,

712
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,260
this is the Bi Han Ji from the Shanggu bird.

713
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,260
Bring it to the body.

714
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,260
It can light up the Zhou Shenshu's stone steps and warm up the Bi Han.

715
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,260
That day, I saw you in the ancestral hall.

716
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
It can be cold and cold.

717
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,260
So I know you're not afraid of cold.

718
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,260
So I'm afraid to ask you to help us in the Yuan Dynasty.

719
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,260
I'll definitely repay this kindness.

720
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,260
Tian Xin, I've helped you.

721
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Go back now. Don't let anyone find out.

722
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
Thank you, Master Shanghao.

723
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,260
Let's go.

724
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,260
Miss,

725
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,260
the new emperor of the Yun Dynasty has helped you to get off the mountain.

726
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,260
Now all the new emperors of Su Yushan are looking for you.

727
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,260
I think it's better to do less than to do less.

728
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
The new emperor of the Yun Dynasty is to save me.

729
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
How can I do something that's not right?

730
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
I'll go with you.

731
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,260
No.

732
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,260
That's the Qi Han's place.

733
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
Don't be so agitated when you go there.

734
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,260
And I'll go there alone.

735
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,260
Miss, be careful.

736
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,260
By the way,

737
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,260
Mo Xiao is still in Su Yushan.

738
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,260
Mo Xiao is under the sun?

739
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,260
He's looking for the root of the flower and antidote.

740
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Help me to check it.
