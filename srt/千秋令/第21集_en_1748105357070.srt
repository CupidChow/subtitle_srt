1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the wind, they are warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There are no ghosts, no ghosts, no waves, no wind, no river, no rain

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No water, no rain, no water, no shadow

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The flowers of life are like dreams, like you

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of the future

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of the future

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
oh

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Dagi

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:55,000
o

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,380
as soon as possible

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,920
At ease

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,760
one more nicely

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,560
Mo Xiang...

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
Mo Xiang!

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,040
Monster begone.

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,960
You like to jot the finishing arts呢

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
言我喆一同鼠山帝子

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,800
带我去继续

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,200
让我在继续

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,120
包括说的教练

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,520
乡タ山爆笑的

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,440
我救了你

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
My lord,

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,280
is triumphant.

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,680
How dare you

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
quatre Ohm,

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,600
rule the world,

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,880
and poke its death.

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,200
End this word of yours.

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:32,260
Dou

51
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,020
Wunyao

52
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Crown Prince.

53
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,440
vanished!

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,840
It's okay.

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:33,340
You want Ji

56
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Ji

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,180
You don't

58
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,680
He can set a trap in the Guanjiania Palace

59
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,380
How could this be possible

60
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
We're of no use

61
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:24,160
we won't let 100

62
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,960
than your spiritual power to this girl.

63
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
The key is in your blood.

64
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,760
Your blood is the antidote to her illness.

65
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,160
If one day, she is ill,

66
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,760
she will die in the valley.

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Why don't you die?

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,760
Die?

69
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
I can predicttin you from that teacher.

70
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,720
Actually she is the one Chinese nobody else loves her for.

71
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,360
She has the ownership of this house while living indogs too.

72
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,960
Let me give you a different view.

73
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:18,260
Before we are all broken,

74
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,760
leave here and pay for that Délai bets.

75
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,160
I've stated instead alone

76
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,040
that there is no one who can kill you.

77
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,920
You can't die just like this.

78
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,520
Thanks.

79
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,960
Mo Xiao!

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,160
Mo Xiao,

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,640
are you still in my dream?

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,480
I dreamt with my wife.

83
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
I must have many people

84
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,160
who must marry you.

85
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,720
Mo Xiao, how dare you set up a barrier in my Sky Demon Sect?

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,760
Are you trying to make me a demon?

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,640
The three of us are together.

88
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,360
I don't believe that I can't destroy the barrier set up by a foreign clan.

89
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,760
Since they don't want to come out, and they don't want us to go in,

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,560
then that's good.

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,760
Then just keep their lives in the Sky Demon Sect's grave.

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
refuge

93
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,200
ternal health

94
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
The Great Wall

95
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Episode 1

96
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
The Great Wall

97
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Episode 1

98
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
The Great Wall

99
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Jing'er, if we take this maze away,

100
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
we can't get out of here.

101
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
So I made this one.

102
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Zhu Qingting?

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
That's right.

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I made Zhu Qingting.

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
It's not ordinary.

106
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
It can be taken to the road.

107
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Let's see if it can take us out.

108
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
The Great Wall

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
The Great Wall

110
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
The Great Wall

111
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
The Great Wall

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
The Great Wall

113
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
You...

114
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Do you know how to make Zhu Qingting?

115
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Of course.

116
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
This is the first time I've made a machine gun.

117
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I've been practicing it.

118
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Then...

119
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Will Brother Mo Xiao know how to make it?

120
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Of course he doesn't.

121
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
If you say you've met him,

122
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
he's indeed a little better than me.

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
But if we talk about machine gun magic,

124
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I, Xie Lin Yun, will say the second place.

125
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
No one dares to say the first place.

126
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Why didn't you say it earlier?

127
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
What's so good about it?

128
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Isn't it just a Zhu Qingting?

129
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
I know how to make it.

130
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Don't worry.

131
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
I'll go check it out.

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Little girl.

133
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
The poison is already coming out.

134
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
I have to go to the dance class.

135
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
You rest for a while.

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Zhu Qingting will take you down the mountain.

137
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I'll go check it out.

138
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
I'm not going anywhere.

139
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
All right.

140
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I'll go check it out.

141
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm going to check it out.

142
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
I'm going to go with you.

143
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Go.

144
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I'll go check it out.

145
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Little girl.

146
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I'm going to go check it out.

147
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I will go down the mountain with you.

148
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
It's you.

149
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,160
It's you who saved me in the back mountain ten years ago.

150
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
It's you.

151
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I didn't think that it was the Mo Xiao from the Xuan Qing Garden.

152
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I still can't do it.

153
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Don't cry.

154
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
It's nothing urgent.

155
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
We have a way to get out.

156
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
If we can't get out,

157
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I will make you feel a little bit guilty.

158
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
We are in this yard,

159
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
a man and a woman are born and raised.

160
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
We are angry with the devil.

161
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Okay?

162
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Go.

163
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Who wants to be a baby girl with you?

164
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Come here.

165
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Come back.

166
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Jing Er, come and catch me.

167
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Where are you?

168
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
What's wrong, Jing Er?

169
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Jing Er.

170
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
You...

171
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
What did you eat with me?

172
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Liu Yun.

173
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
What's wrong with you?

174
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I just fainted.

175
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Since we are caught by you,

176
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
please give us a quick break.

177
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
You put us in this maze.

178
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
What's the use of it?

179
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
If you want to live,

180
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
I will stay here.

181
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Thank you, Liu Yun.

182
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Let's go.

183
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Cong Er.

184
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Cong Er.

185
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Father, thank you, uncle.

186
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Cong Er.

187
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Since the魔 Sect has been removed,

188
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
you should arrange for everyone to leave Ayu Valley

189
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
in case of any changes.

190
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Father,

191
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
we are all safe and sound.

192
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Now, we are left with

193
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
the disciples of Mount Zu in Ayu Valley.

194
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
That's good.

195
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Where is Ling Yun?

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Why didn't he see the shadow?

197
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Well,

198
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
two chiefs,

199
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Chief Xie and Junior Jing,

200
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
have already broken out of Ayu Valley.

201
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
What do you mean?

202
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Where have they gone?

203
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Father,

204
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
since Jing Er stole my jade pendant

205
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
and the real brother's head,

206
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I guess they went to Suyu Mountain.

207
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
They were so angry that

208
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
they saw that they had succeeded.

209
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
My Master Su,

210
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
they went to Suyu Mountain.

211
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
That bastard is so unreasonable.

212
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
Jing Er is still holding it.

213
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
What if there is any short and short time,

214
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
or if he meets any danger,

215
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
how can we explain to Senior Wen Rong?

216
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Well, Junior Brother Xie,

217
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
don't worry.

218
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Since our own leader has been removed,

219
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
it means that

220
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
the battle has ended on Mount Suyu Mountain.

221
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Jing Er and Ling Yun

222
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
are going to Suyu Mountain.

223
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Maybe they can meet Senior Brother Zhang Wen

224
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
and the chief.

225
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
There won't be any big trouble.

226
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
No matter what happens,

227
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
they won't be able to save

228
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
the jade pendant.

229
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
They went to Suyu Mountain on their own.

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm dead?

231
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I just thought of a dream.

232
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
What's the matter?

233
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Pei Pei Pei.

234
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm not dead.

235
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Why are you crying?

236
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm not crying.

237
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm just lost by the flower powder outside.

238
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
I'll blow it for you.

239
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
You'd better take care of yourself first.

240
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
The iron door of Tangtang is the chief.

241
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
It's so dangerous

242
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
to be killed by someone

243
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
just in one move.

244
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Then I'm not worried about you.

245
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
If I'm not worried about you,

246
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
can I be attacked by that ghost shadow?

247
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
That person said

248
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
the four states are all in a maze.

249
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Even if the Great Luo Jinxian can't get out,

250
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
will we be

251
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
starved to death here?

252
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
You two

253
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
did the devil send you here?

254
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Why did he lock us up here?

255
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
You two are talking.

256
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
What does this mean?

257
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Are you going to eat?

258
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Don't you know

259
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
how we eat?

260
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I think the two of them are dumb.

261
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Enough.

262
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Don't bother them.

263
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Eat.

264
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Since Su Yiding has been broken,

265
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
he's been missing the chief and the young chief.

266
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Since he's been missing the chief and the young chief,

267
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Young Master Jing and Young Master Xie are back.

268
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Are they going to be in the mountain?

269
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Please do the three-dial law

270
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
and investigate the mountain.

271
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Well...

272
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Senior Murong,

273
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
why don't I go with you?

274
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
It's good.

275
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Report.

276
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Chief, the chief is back.

277
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Go and have a look.

278
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Senior Murong.

279
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Brother.

280
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Go and bring your master in.

281
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Lin Xi.

282
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Lin Xi.

283
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Mo Xiao.

284
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Mo Xiao.

285
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Mo Xiao.

286
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Lin Xi.

287
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Lin Xi.

288
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Are you all right?

289
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Are you hurt?

290
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
I trust you.

291
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
What?

292
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
My father was in a coma.

293
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I believe you.

294
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
I believe you.

295
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Maybe this is a miracle.

296
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I came to save you today

297
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
because before the accident,

298
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I had to keep your life.

299
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
You can't die.

300
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
But if you lie to me,

301
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I'll still kill you.

302
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
All right.

303
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
I'll keep this mask for you.

304
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
I'll keep it for you.

305
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
I'll keep it for you.

306
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
I'll keep it for you.

307
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
I'll keep it for you.

308
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Chief.

309
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
It feels better.

310
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
How is the ancestral hall?

311
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
It opened the ancestral hall.

312
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Where is Feng Li Xue?

313
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
She...

314
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
dropped her with Mo Xiao into the ancestral hall.

315
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
What?

316
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Chief.

317
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Why didn't you stop her?

318
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Chief.

319
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Li Xue has trained Mo Xiao

320
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
to give her the ice cream.

321
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
She has already disturbed

322
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
the spiritual power of the Ice Manor.

323
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
She is against it.

324
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
To me,

325
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
there is nothing more important than protecting you.

326
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,160
You know how important they are to my plan.

327
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Chief.

328
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Mo Xiao has broken the magical device of the Celestial Demon Sect,

329
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
the Su Yu Deng.

330
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
He has committed a big crime.

331
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Don't talk about the two-starred clan.

332
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
The Celestial Demon Clan won't let her go.

333
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Li Xue You has saved Mo Xiao

334
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
from the ancestral hall

335
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
in the middle of the crowd.

336
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
She has become the main power of the two people.

337
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Chief.

338
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
If you still try to protect her,

339
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
our plan will be exposed.

340
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Chief.

341
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
San Si.

342
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Li Xue

343
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
must not stay in the Celestial Demon courtyard.

344
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Celestial Demon Lord.

345
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
The Cult has become well-set.

346
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
We should protect it.

347
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Thank you.

348
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
What's this?

349
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,880
I used experienced经 fragrance to catch the magic怎麼樣?

350
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Have a look on the outside.

351
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,320
Take care.

352
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Li Xue.

353
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
Who are you?

354
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,680
Who are you again?

355
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,280
I'm a disciple of Mount Shu.

356
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Mo Xiao.

357
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Mount Shu?

358
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,480
You're a disciple of Mount Shu?

359
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
That's impossible.

360
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
It's impossible.

361
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Mo Xiao.

362
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Master.

363
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Come with me.

364
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
But Mo Xiao...

365
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Shut up.

366
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,080
Who are you?

367
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Senior sister.

368
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm a disciple of Mount Shu.

369
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Mo Xiao.

370
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,280
May I ask you who you are?

371
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
No.

372
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
You're not a disciple of Mount Shu.

373
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,880
Everything here

374
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,480
is not suitable for you.

375
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,480
What do you mean?

376
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
The Sky Demon Spirit.

377
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,080
It must be the summoning of the Sky Demon Spirit.

378
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
You may leave.

379
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Senior sister.

380
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
I'll take you with me.

381
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
No.

382
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
When you're done,

383
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,280
you'll return to this place

384
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,280
after you've done what you should.

385
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,280
I'll wait for you here.

386
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,280
I'm getting a handle on things.

387
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,880
What are you thinking about?

388
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,880
Aren't you all hungry?

389
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Have some.

390
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Since your food is bad,

391
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
I've driven over it for you.

392
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm sure there won't be any poison himself.

393
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,040
What does it mean?

394
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,560
It's been so long.

395
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,480
Such a good dish is taking us.

396
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,200
Do you want to drive us away

397
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,520
and sleep in your Tian Mo's sleep?

398
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,120
It must be duck.

399
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
Eat it, Jing'er.

400
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,440
You're really wasting it.

401
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,120
Take it.

402
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,760
Wait.

403
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,160
I'll have another one of this soup.

404
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,240
You're still drinking?

405
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,640
Are you afraid of losing your stomach?

406
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
Why don't you drink it?

407
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,160
Why are you hitting me?

408
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,400
It hurts.

409
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,720
You hit me with your hand.

410
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,160
What did you find?

411
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,360
Do you want to escape from the courtyard?

412
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Do you have a way?

413
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Of course.

414
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,880
Guys,

415
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,920
I'm coming over.

416
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,440
What a wonderful start.

417
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,280
What's up?

418
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,640
How can I help you?

419
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
You're sweating?

420
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
Be careful.

421
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,840
You said that the two stars are really making trouble with the lord.

422
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Who are we listening to?

423
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Of course, we are listening to the lord.

424
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
The lord is the biggest.

425
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
But the lord is not my Tianmou clan.

426
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
His disciple is with the Shushan disciple.

427
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
He is trapped in Tianmou Garden.

428
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
The lord saved his disciple, Feng Lixue.

429
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,840
It seems that he doesn't care about the destruction of my clan.

430
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,840
You said that the lord is not like the lord.

431
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Could the two stars really be able to stop the lord?

432
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,840
But Tianmou clan has never had such a strong mind.

433
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Even if the lord can't stop the lord,

434
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,840
his disciple, the lord of Shaohao,

435
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
will definitely not stop.

436
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
What are you doing?

437
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Hurry up and follow him.

438
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Here we are.

439
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Is the Shushan disciple, the brother Mo Xiao?

440
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Is there anyone else besides him?

441
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Then brother Mo Xiao should be trapped in Tianmou Garden.

442
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Where is Tianmou Garden?

443
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
We have to save him.

444
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
If the map is not wrong,

445
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
it should be under the ancestral hall of the Demon School.

446
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Where is the ancestral hall of the Demon School?

447
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Follow him.

448
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Drink it.

449
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,840
The master told you that the Han Ice Fist is the Shushan Heart Fist.

450
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
It is similar to your internal force.

451
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
It is strong and powerful.

452
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
The internal force of the two bones is similar in the body.

453
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Your body cannot be held back.

454
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
You cannot use it.

455
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Why don't you listen to me?

456
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
The situation is dangerous.

457
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
I am afraid that I will be in danger.

458
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
I am afraid that I will be in danger.

459
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
I am afraid that I will be in danger.

460
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
I am afraid that I will be in danger.

461
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I am afraid that I will be in danger.

462
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
I am afraid that I will be in danger.

463
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Fortunately, there is a master by your side.

464
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Drink the medicine.

465
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
It will be cured soon.

466
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
What's wrong?

467
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Master, I am almost recovered.

468
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
I don't need it this time.

469
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
You are not a master.

470
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Master,

471
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Mo Xiao is still trapped in the Sky Fist.

472
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
We cannot be a master.

473
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
How do you want to be a master?

474
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Master promised me that

475
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
he would complete the plan by himself.

476
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
And Mo Xiao's life is mine.

477
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I said so.

478
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I am a master.

479
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
I am a master.

480
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
I am a master.

481
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
I have said so.

482
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
So before that,

483
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
I don't allow anyone to kill him.

484
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
If

485
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
it is master who wants to kill him,

486
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I will kill him.

487
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Zi Su, how is master's wound?

488
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
The wound is scarred.

489
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Fortunately, the knife and wind

490
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
have two parts that have not been damaged.

491
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
But it is too much blood,

492
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
it can only cause a big wound.

493
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Father,

494
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
the affairs of the Apricot Valley

495
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
have been handled well.

496
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
The whole world is about to leave.

497
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Now, the master is seriously injured.

498
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
How about you and Mr. Xie

499
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
go to the Sky Fist?

500
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
I will go to the Sky Fist.

501
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
I will wait for the young master

502
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
and Jing Er's news.

503
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Then you stay here.

504
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I will send the young master to the Sky Fist.

505
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
If anything happens,

506
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
remember,

507
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
you must send the wind and rain

508
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
to me immediately.

509
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Yes.

510
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Master,

511
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
we are the young master's guards.

512
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
We will also stay here

513
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
waiting for the young master,

514
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Young Master Jing and Young Master Xie.

515
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Yu Hang,

516
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
you stay with me.

517
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Jian Chuan,

518
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
your master said that

519
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
he would come to the Sky Fist.

520
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
I will wait for him.

521
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Jian Chuan,

522
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
your master is injured.

523
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Someone needs to take care of him.

524
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
You go with us to the Sky Fist.

525
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
I understand.

526
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
You must be very careful

527
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
when you stay here.

528
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Yes.

529
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Mother,

530
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
how is the ancestral hall?

531
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Are you going to ask

532
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Feng Lixue?

533
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Mother is waiting for the young master

534
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
to go to the palace.

535
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
But she is still very worried.

536
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Are you worried about me

537
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
or about Feng Lixue?

538
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Of course I am worried about you.

539
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
But

540
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
is Lixue all right?

541
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Mother,

542
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
you have been weak

543
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
for so many years.

544
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I know.

545
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
The Poisonous Demon Lord

546
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
also avoided the matter

547
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
in the school.

548
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Why are you

549
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
suddenly concerned about it?

550
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
I think

551
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
you should be careful.

552
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
You and I

553
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
avoided the Poisonous Demon Lord

554
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
to avoid the teaching.

555
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
What did you do?

556
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Do you remember?

557
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Of course it was to avoid

558
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
the Chongguang Labyrinth.

559
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
I secretly looked for

560
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
the unknown brother.

561
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Back then,

562
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
I suffered from the pain of dying of husband and son.

563
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
I couldn't be free for long.

564
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
I secretly went back to Li Shui He.

565
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
But I was lucky to meet you

566
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
at the river bank.

567
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
I took you back to

568
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
the Suyu Mountain

569
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
and took you as my adopted son.

570
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
When you were eight,

571
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
I took you to the ancestral hall

572
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
and made you

573
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
the youngest householder

574
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
in the ancestral hall.

575
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
What did you do?

576
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
I was looking for the Poisonous Demon Lord

577
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
to find the Poisonous Demon Lord

578
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
to find the Poisonous Demon Lord.

579
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
I hope that one day,

580
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I can find the unknown brother

581
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
in the lower realm

582
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
and find the real Poisonous Demon Lord

583
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
of the Heavenly Mother Tribe.

584
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Very good.

585
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
You still remember?

586
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
It's been eighteen years.

587
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
If my child

588
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
is still in this world,

589
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I will

590
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
be like the chief of the Suyu Mountain.

591
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
I'm afraid that you are too old.

592
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
I really can't wait any longer.

593
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Poisonous Dark cold

594
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
I still remember

595
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
When you just got on Mount Mang,

596
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I went to see you every time.

597
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
What was the first thing you did?

598
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Actually,

599
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
we recently met.

600
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Brilliant.

601
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
I can act too.

602
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
I'm laughing as beautiful as you.

603
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
I haven't gotten too excited.

604
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
It's not that.

605
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
I am doing this for my own good.

606
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
The first time I did this for myself,

607
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
was when you taught me.

608
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
You like beautiful things.

609
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
The world is too long.

610
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
If you are not good enough

611
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
for what you do,

612
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
you can destroy it.

613
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
I will do it.

614
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Li Xue,

615
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Master is going to repair it tonight.

616
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Come and help him.

617
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Master,

618
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840
can I let Chang Ming help?

619
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Why?

620
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
You want to reject me?

621
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
I am not feeling well.

622
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
I want to go back to the palace for a rest.

623
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
You are still my Li Xue?

624
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Master,

625
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
you are always Li Xue's master.

626
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Miao,

627
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
you are good at it.

628
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
But you have to remember,

629
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,840
we are not just simple masters.

630
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
We are not just simple masters.

631
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
We are just simple masters.

632
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
We are one.

633
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
You are always,

634
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,840
always my Li Xue.

635
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
I am sorry.

636
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
I am sorry.

637
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
It should be here.

638
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Is it wrong to go back to the palace?

639
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
It should be.

640
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
We have tried it.

641
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
If it is wrong,

642
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
it can only prove that the map is wrong.

643
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
You are so mean.

644
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
If it is not for you,

645
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
we would not use

646
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
so many places to find the village.

647
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Enough.

648
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
Go down now.

649
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
I...

650
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
You are so sweet.

651
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Then follow me.

652
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Stop.

653
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
All the exits of the prison

654
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
must not be taken away.

655
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Yes.

656
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Yes.

657
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Jing'er, what's wrong?

658
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,840
I have pretending to be the prince of the emperor.

659
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Jing'er, hold on.

660
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
We can definitely get out.

661
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Come on.

662
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Have a good rest.

663
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Mu Xiao.

664
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Mu Xiao.

665
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
You are so sweet.

666
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Why are you here?

667
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
I heard that you are in the prison.

668
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
It's dangerous.

669
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
He is going to save you.

670
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Are you all right?

671
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
I am fine.

672
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
By the way,

673
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
why are you here?

674
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Where is master and their master?

675
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
How is Aiyu?

676
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
We were going to make some progress.

677
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
We have to do some research.

678
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
We have to find them.

679
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
We are going to find them.

680
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
I will go to the prison.

681
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
I am sorry.

682
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
We are not going to find them.

683
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
I am sorry.

684
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
I will go to the prison.

685
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
No, you can't go.

686
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
I will go to the prison.

687
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
No, please.

688
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Excuse me.

689
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Are you all right, master?

690
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
I am fine.

691
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
Master and a sound.

692
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Yes.

693
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Right.

694
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
We are on the Theater Supervisory.

695
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
You are in the favorites room.

696
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Here is another,

697
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
these woodenеждеler with rail.

698
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Hi.

699
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
Yes, master.

700
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Haимeng...

701
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Thank you for your hard work.

702
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,840
I will remember

703
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
where they will buy again.

704
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
We will perform some research after the freshman year.

705
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Let's go.

706
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Yes.

707
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
I am glad.

708
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
I got to know what is better.

709
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
But I don't think

710
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
they could understand

711
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
that we are lost now.

712
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
So,

713
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
now not quite sure

714
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
You're thoughtful.

715
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,960
Qing Shi Mei?

716
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,280
What's wrong with her?

717
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,720
She was hit by the Lotus Thread Embroidery of Ming Huan.

718
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,960
It's all my fault.

719
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,680
I should have let her come down first.

720
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,080
Ling Yue, how about this?

721
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,080
Let's let Qing Shi Mei rest here.

722
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,080
You go with me in there.

723
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,600
Okay.

724
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,000
Boxiao, what's wrong?

725
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,120
It's nothing.

726
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,520
Maybe she was sucked in by the Spirit Spirit

727
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,880
by the Spirit Spirit.

728
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,960
She's a bit dizzy.

729
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,840
Qing Shi, how are you?

730
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm fine.

731
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,240
Don't worry.

732
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,360
Hold on for a while.

733
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,600
I'll let Zi Su

734
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,960
take care of you right away.

735
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Don't bother me.

736
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,720
Go find the exit.

737
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,440
Okay.

738
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,600
Let's go.

739
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Isn't it a secret passageway?

740
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,400
Can you run further if you get out from it?

741
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,600
Are these were按刀 of Demon Clan?

742
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,440
That's right.

743
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,400
I was also�나

744
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,000
pretty shocked to find it

745
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,760
once I saw it on the map.

746
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,040
I didn't expect

747
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,600
such a large prison hand geen cer obl and

748
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
the guards of the Demon Lord's Army.

749
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
But they can't stand it.

750
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,160
Every exit?

751
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,120
You mean the tunnel

752
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,640
leads to every palace in the Demon Lord's Army?

753
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,280
Yes.

754
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,040
The Wuxiang Palace in Chonggong?

755
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,760
Mo Xiao,

756
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,880
when will it be?

757
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,360
We need to keep it safe.

758
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,760
I came here to save Li Xue.

759
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,440
I haven't made any progress.

760

Why are you so stubborn?
