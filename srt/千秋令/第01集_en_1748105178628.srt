00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Even if Plague changed,

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,560
you could fight such hints

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,140
But the Glid reflection until now

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,420
can fail

44
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:15,060
such a deceptive spirit was the great deity to stop the established demon world by great demons,

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,780
allowing the selection of all kรiced of the gods and the subspecies of all the langot 적ankind.

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,060
All the demons in the world have beensecurity sent to the power of the рек,

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,060
which will allow the gods known to be state-bound.

48
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,060
Death is not being afraid of coming against them.

49
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,180
The slow death of the deity will bring another death.

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,180
The King of Heaven, Degu, tried to take over the Three Realms of the Thousand-Glorious Order.

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Xun Yi led the Demon Lord to the Heaven Realm to fight with Bai Yan.

52
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,180
The Immortal of the Clouds, Yu Qing, and Shen Ai Xuan.

53
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,180
In the end, the Immortal of the Four Realms and Xun Yi colluded with the Thousand-Glorious Order.

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,180
The two of them returned to the Imperial Realm.

55
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,180
The Immortal of the Clouds, Bai Yan, has used his own spiritual power to distract the Thousand-Glorious Order.

56
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,180
He protected the two realms of the Two Realms.

57
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Bai Yan has used his soul mate, Han Bing, to put the Thousand-Glorious Order into the Heavenly Realm.

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,180
He has sealed the Thousand-Glorious Order with his own spirit.

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,180
The Thousand-Glorious Order has left the Ice Palace from here.

60
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Bai Yan's Immortal has left the Ice Palace from here.

61
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,180
This time, the Immortal of the Immortal, Demon Lord, will fight and fight.

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,180
The Immortal of the Immortal and Xun Yi committed a crime of colluding with the Thousand-Glorious Order.

63
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,180
When the Immortal of the Clouds, Yu Zu, has been implicated,

64
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,180
the Heavenly Emperor has sent a decree to cast her out of the Heavenly Realm.

65
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,180
She is no longer in the Immortal-Glorious Order.

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,180
Lord Dan He, look at my unrivaled feather.

67
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
It is not pretty at all.

68
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,180
Or we won't be able to pull it out.

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,700
Exactly. My old wife

70
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,380
is just a few of these official servants.

71
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,580
She's going to be exposed to this old thing.

72
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,180
I think that Bai Yu Ling Shan

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,380
is useless.

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,580
What is it?

75
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,980
Yes, Lord Dan He.

76
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,780
You've already made two spiritual mountains.

77
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,780
You can't take back her original spirit.

78
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,380
I don't think this spiritual mountain is useful at all.

79
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,180
Before, it was not as good as before.

80
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Maybe this one will be enough.

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,180
If the Nihuang can find back her original spirit,

82
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,180
maybe our Yuzu will still have the day of the Shen Clan.

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,180
He Ying, what are you doing?

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,580
Put down the spirit.

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
You're helping her find her sister again?

86
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,380
That sister is the culprit of colluding with the Demon Clan.

87
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,380
Is she coming back to kill our Dan Xue Shan?

88
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,180
The most important cards in our Dan Xue Shan

89
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,180
are all given by her sister.

90
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,180
She's a monster who can only be born with a single body.

91
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,980
I think she's not a normal bloodline.

92
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,780
He Ying, don't talk nonsense.

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,780
Nihuang is the owner of Dan Xue Shan.

94
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,180
Even if it's a Heavenly Palace's crime,

95
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,380
we can't fight with each other.

96
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,380
What do you think? Come and fight with me.

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,980
You're so nice.

98
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,180
Nihuang, your sister was punished by the Heavenly Palace.

99
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,980
She's not the only one who's guilty.

100
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,380
The Fire Phoenix Clan has long been the master of the Dan Xue Shan Yuzu.

101
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,180
He Ying, the road is rough, the wall is weak.

102
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,980
Even the little birds that just grew out of the forest

103
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,180
can understand the reason.

104
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,380
How could I be able to stand by your side?

105
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,180
That's right.

106
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,380
Say it.

107
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,780
You stupid birds, how dare you stand with her?

108
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,380
You should have been punished by her.

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,180
Nihuang is not fair to us.

110
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,580
Why should we punish her?

111
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,380
You should be punished.

112
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,780
Yu Qing is the most innocent.

113
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,180
He always wants to be a good person.

114
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,580
He wants to revive Yu Qing.

115
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,780
If he is known by the heavens,

116
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,380
he will definitely destroy her spirit.

117
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,780
By then, you will kneel at my feet

118
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,580
and beg me to protect you.

119
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,180
Protect us?

120
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,580
With your cultivation?

121
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,980
What's wrong with my cultivation?

122
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,380
You are just a little bit of a coward.

123
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,580
What's so great about that?

124
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,780
He Ying, listen to me.

125
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,780
My sister liked Demon Lord back then.

126
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,980
She was cheated and used at the same time.

127
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,780
Now, I want to find her spirit.

128
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,980
I just want to take her to the heavens and make a good talk.

129
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,780
My sister didn't commit a crime. Why should she be punished?

130
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,180
The Lian Yu Tribe is not fair.

131
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,380
After I finish this matter,

132
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,380
the Lian Yu Tribe will be re-established.

133
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,580
They will not be punished by the late.

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,580
Nihuang, wait!

135
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,580
Sooner or later, I will kick you out of the snow mountain!

136
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,780
Thank you for helping me collect the spirit.

137
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,180
Nihuang, I support you to find Yu Qing's spirit.

138
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,580
I don't want to see you suffer.

139
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,380
The Heavens are free to lead the country.

140
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,980
You don't need to beg.

141
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,580
Dan He and Grandpa, you are the ones who have sent me here.

142
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,380
I won't suffer.

143
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,580
Now, Bai Yu has already collected the spirit.

144
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,580
This time, you must succeed.

145
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,180
I have failed twice.

146
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,980
Now, I have found the magic of using this fan.

147
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,180
The spirit is rising.

148
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,980
Is it the spirit of my sister?

149
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,380
Who are you?

150
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Why are you here?

151
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,780
If you don't say anything, then I will punish you.

152
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,380
The jade ring of the Heavens is not dead.

153
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,980
But the jade ring has the spirit power to move.

154
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,380
It cannot be found clearly.

155
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Dan He, you are just like the jade ring.

156
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,780
You just looked fierce.

157
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,180
You thought you were a good person.

158
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,780
Why did you change your mind?

159
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,980
It seems that you have been frozen here for a long time.

160
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,580
Your head is frozen.

161
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,580
Just let the position of vital integrity,

162
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,180
I can't.

163
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,380
But the power that I have with you,

164
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,780
it's very powerful.

165
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
You need to protect me at all costs.

166
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,180
facilitated

167
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,980
Is it a real thing?

168
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,680
You can go to sleep without harsher.

169
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,480
Don't drink.

170
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,380
I am sitting here.

171
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,980
there was a movement.

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,460
But we can't find out

173
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,100
why it was caused.

174
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,260
Your Majesty,

175
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,780
I've checked Li Jing Tian's body.

176
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,260
Li Jing Tian's body is fine.

177
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,140
But there's a movement in his body.

178
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,300
I can't find out clearly.

179
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,060
I'm afraid that I can't get into

180
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,260
the secret mansion of the Heavenly Lord.

181
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,940
Is there really

182
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,060
no impression of the body?

183
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,940
No.

184
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,380
Your Majesty,

185
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,060
the God of War

186
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,020
has sealed the seal of the Heavenly Lord.

187
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,740
It's been thousands of years.

188
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Li Jing Tian's body is moving.

189
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,260
I'm afraid that

190
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,580
the God of War will wake up

191
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,060
if he's re-waking.

192
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,540
If the God of War really wakes up,

193
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,260
then it's a good thing for me to do.

194
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,220
Lord Yuan You,

195
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,460
please don't disturb the God of War

196
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,460
in the next few days.

197
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,900
Lord EmaICao,

199
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,060
why are you soords Cruelessly pointing at His Majesty?

200
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,300
I hope not.

201
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,140
Don't move.

202
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,740
Father.

203
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,580
Father.

204
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,980
Father.

205
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,180
Father.

206
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,040
DesIRE

207
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,380
Where did the this alp Copenhage see?

208
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,340
Lin Jing is impermanent

209
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,120
Are you waking up?

210
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,620
Like this?

211
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,340
Yes.

You just are embarrassed.

I'll observe the king's behavior for now.

245
00:14:51,680 --> 00:15:13,560
You must be serious about

246
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,840
your princess'stalk,

247
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,040
Why did you appear in the forest?

248
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,480
You'd better answer me this question.

249
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,440
Otherwise,

250
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,840
there's no window, no door,

251
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,240
and no one is watching.

252
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,720
I came in.

253
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
You came in?

254
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,200
Yes.

255
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,560
You came in from the forest?

256
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,320
Yes.

257
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,280
How's the weather outside?

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Cold?

259
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,560
Messages.

260
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,120
A thousand years.

261
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,440
A thousand years.

262
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,280
Finally a cold wave came from the sky.

263
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,840
A thousand years?

264
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,400
You said that

265
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,160
you'd been trapped in the soldier's floor for a thousand years?

266
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,840
алось.

267
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,200
Waking up is not!

268
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,340
What's the difference?

269
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,340
If I didn't break in, you'd be trapped here all the time.

270
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,340
No wonder you came out and asked if it was cold outside.

271
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
You haven't answered my question yet.

272
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,340
How did you break into this Li Qing Tian?

273
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
I'm Ni Huang.

274
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
I heard that a relative of mine

275
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,340
brought me here to summon the Three-Demon-Eyeed God.

276
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,340
But I didn't expect that you brought me here

277
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,340
to break into your sister's room.

278
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
Where's my spiritual fan?

279
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Where's my spiritual fan?

280
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,340
What are you looking at? Don't believe me?

281
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Forget it. Do you believe I'm not important?

282
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
I'm going to find my spiritual fan.

283
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
Xiang Tao?

284
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,340
What's wrong with your white snake?

285
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,340
I saved you because I wanted to repay you first and second.

286
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
Instead, you asked me everywhere.

287
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,340
I've already said that I have something important to do.

288
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Let go.

289
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
It's not clear whether the Three-Demon-Eyeed God is not important.

290
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,340
You can't leave.

291
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,340
Three-Demon-Eyeed God?

292
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,340
You're too stubborn.

293
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
You...

294
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
What's going on?

295
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
I saved you because you wanted to repay me first and second.

296
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
Let go of me.

297
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
I think there's a demon.

298
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,340
I'll help you.

299
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Hurry and leave.

300
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,340
I can't stand it anymore.

301
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
I'll kill you.

302
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,340
I'll kill you.

303
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Ni Huo.

304
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
Ni Huo.

305
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Ni Huo.

306
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
Wake up.

307
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,340
I saved you again.

308
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,340
I'm fine.

310
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
Wake up.

311
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,340
Wake up.

312
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,340
It's cold.

313
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,340
He's got my soul-dry illness.

314
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
I'll leave him again.

315
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
I can't help but to get better.

316
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,340
What's going on?

319
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
Rest well.

320
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
Come with me.

321
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
Wait.

322
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
I'll go with you.

323
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
I'm afraid...

324
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I'll make you sad.

325
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,340
We've been together for a night.

326
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,340
I saved you too.

327
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
But...

328
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,340
I won't let you go.

329
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,340
Please don't let it go.

330
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
The internal conflict between us is over.

331
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
I'm afraid...

332
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
we'll be separated.

333
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,340
The fate between us is here.

334
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,340
It's still a long way to go.

335
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,340
You can't leave

336
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
before you say why you broke into the Li Jing Tian.

337
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
Even if you want to keep me safe,

338
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
you don't have to say a word.

339
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
I saved you.

340
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
You saved me.

341
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,340
We don't want to see each other again.

342
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,340
I said you can't leave.

343
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
I'll help you find

344
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
the fan that you want.

345
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
My fan?

346
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,340
My spiritual mountain is with you.

347
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,340
Where did you hide it?

348
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,340
I'll give it back to you when I open it.

349
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
Let's go.

350
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Come on.

351
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
General Zhan.

352
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
But this is General Zhan.

353
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Hurry up and go to see him.

354
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,340
Thank you, general.

355
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Master, you're back.

356
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
Master?

357
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,340
You still have a disciple?

358
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,340
Welcome back, Master.

359
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,340
I'm not here.

360
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,340
Do you have any energy?

361
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,340
I'm just guarding the Silver Flower Palace.

362
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

363
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

364
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

365
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

366
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

367
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

368
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

369
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,340
I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.

370
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
You're so stupid.

371
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Master, this is...

372
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,340
This is a disciple I've received from the Imperial Guards.

373
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
He went into the Heavenly Palace to try something.

374
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
You should take good care of him.

375
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Don't let him get in trouble.

376
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
I'll go find the Heavenly Lord and give him a life.

377
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
I'll be back in a minute.

378
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,340
A disciple?

379
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,340
You're a disciple I've received.

380
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,340
That's my junior.

381
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,340
I'm not his disciple.

382
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
I'm his savior.

383
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Save me.

384
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,340
You didn't do anything wrong, did you?

385
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,340
Master, he saved the God of War in the Three Realms.

386
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,340
You saved him?

387
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
Welcome back, God of War.

388
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,340
Welcome back, God of War.

389
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,340
Heavenly Lord.

390
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,340
The God of War has been sealed for thousands of years.

391
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,340
He's finally back in the Four Realms.

392
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,340
He's truly a great man.

393
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Heavenly Lord, you're so great.

394
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
You've protected the Three Realms.

395
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,340
You're a great man.

396
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,340
I haven't seen you for thousands of years.

397
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,340
The God of War has been sealed for a long time.

398
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,340
It's a great gift from you.

399
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

400
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,340
Congratulations on your return.

401
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,340
You've been a great man for thousands of years.

402
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,340
You've been a great man for thousands of years.

403
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,340
Now that you've been a great man, you're in a good mood.

404
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
Thank you, Heavenly Lord.

405
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,340
You're welcome.

406
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,340
The God of War has returned to the Three Realms.

407
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,340
I heard that there's another little fairy

408
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,340
who has returned with the God of War.

409
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,340
I wonder which way to go.

410
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,340
She's a little fairy from the military base.

411
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,340
She was a human after my spiritual power.

412
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
I took her back to the Heavenly Palace

413
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,340
to teach her to get the God of War.

414
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
So you're the disciple of the God of War.

415
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
What a pity.

416
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
This is your residence.

417
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
You really have to learn the rules.

418
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Are you really a God of War?

419
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,340
I don't know how he can take your disciple.

420
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,340
I'm not his disciple.

421
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,340
I'm your...

422
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
Qing He.

423
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,340
Master.

424
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
It's too cold in the palace.

425
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
You can warm her up.

426
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,340
By the way, bring my Purple Star Soul Lake with you.

427
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Yes.

428
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,340
You'll be in trouble again.

429
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
I won't let you talk about it.

430
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,340
And don't mention the matter of the bed.

431
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Do you hear me?

432
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
Tell me.

433
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Why?

434
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Why?

435
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,340
Why?

436
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,340
You can't stand the fact that you're a God of War.

437
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
I'll tell you clearly in front of the Heavenly Lord.

438
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
I came here to get the spiritual fan.

439
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
I didn't know what the problem was.

440
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Besides, your problem is too weak.

441
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,340
I can't afford to go in.

442
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,340
Are you afraid that the Heavenly Lord will blame you?

443
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
So you're going to blame me?

444
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,340
Even if you're not a God of War,

445
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,340
you can't get rid of the Heavenly Lord's kindness

446
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,340
by using your identity as a God of War.

447
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
A God of War?

448
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
How did you know that?

449
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
Okay.

450
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
I can't mention Li Jing Tian's matter.

451
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,340
But you can see my identity as a God of War.

452
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
And the other Immortals can see it too.

453
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
How can I hide it?

454
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,340
I've told the Immortals that

455
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,340
you're just a small gold-gainer under the Ice Garden.

456
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
You're the one who changed my personality

457
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
under my spiritual power and self-reliance.

458
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
Now you're my disciple.

459
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Gold-gainer?

460
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
I'm a single-legged mountain fire-gainer.

461
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
You let me put on a fish?

462
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
I'm afraid of water the most.

463
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Water is like fire, so I don't know how to attract people.

464
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,340
I've sealed your body.

465
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
Most people can't break it.

466
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
You sealed your body?

467
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I...

468
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,340
Hey!

469
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,340
You really changed me into a fish?

470
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,340
You're so annoying!

471
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
Where's my phoenix?

472
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
Give it back to me!

473
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Can you help me change my personality?

474
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
It's too strong.

475
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Before the seal is removed,

476
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,340
you can only use your spiritual power.

477
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
I'm begging you,

478
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,340
when can you help me remove it?

479
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
When you leave me,

480
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
I'll help you.

481
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
When can you let me leave?

482
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,340
My current mission is to find my White Rain Spirit Fan.

483
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
By the way,

484
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,340
you told me on the ice garden that

485
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
you had a close friend.

486
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
How much money did you have?

487
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
The one who killed Xiang Yi.

488
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
He killed Xiang Yi?

489
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
It's...

490
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
Fu Xue.

491
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,340
It's you.

492
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
My White Rain Spirit Fan

493
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
brought me into the forest.

494
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
He must have his reason.

495
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
If I hadn't saved you in the middle,

496
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,340
I might have found my broken spirit.

497
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
By the way,

498
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
you're the real Dragon God.

499
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
You should know my sister.

500
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,340
Although you've been apart for a long time,

501
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,340
can you help me recall?

502
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
Maybe you can find

503
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
the key to breaking my spirit.

504
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Your sister?

505
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,340
Yes.

506
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,340
I've etted you back

507
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,920
since the spring swing was and

508
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,780
that you've both altruistic and

509
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
astringent.

510
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
My son?

511
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,340
I have to see him in person because

512
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,180
of this OMOROOMED

513
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,380
I'm not asking for your help.

514
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,780
I'm not asking for your help.

515
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,980
I'm asking for your help.

516
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Originally, the Immortal Army

517
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
was looking for you when I was six years old.

518
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,380
But I thought that you were just awake

519
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,780
and you weren't recovered yet.

520
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,980
So I made the decision

521
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
and pushed you all the way here.

522
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,180
That's great.

523
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,580
You know me best.

524
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,780
I know I'm not good at this.

525
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,180
Come. Please have a seat.

526
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,780
You're so good to wake up.

527
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,980
Some days ago,

528
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,780
Li Jing Tian suddenly had an operation.

529
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,180
We thought

530
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,180
there was a demon demon.

531
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,180
So our Immortal Army has recovered its spiritual power.

532
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,780
It's about to wake up.

533
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,780
Let me show you something.

534
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,980
This is a magic weapon I found

535
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,780
outside the barrier

536
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,380
ten days ago.

537
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,380
Although this fan

538
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,580
doesn't have much spiritual power,

539
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,380
it appears outside the barrier.

540
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
It's not as common as it used to be.

541
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
But it's not as confusing as it used to be.

542
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,380
Before I found the Immortal Master,

543
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,380
I didn't return to the Heavenly Lord.

544
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,180
This is just a small fan that has a spiritual power.

545
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,780
Which little immortal

546
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,180
did you leave behind?

547
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Maybe.

548
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,180
Where's the Immortal?

549
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,980
Who?

550
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,180
The disciple you brought back from the Ice Garden.

551
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
He can be a spiritual power

552
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,580
that is adopted by you in the world.

553
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,380
It's really a rare opportunity.

554
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
You shouldn't let me see them.

555
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,380
He's just a very low-ranking spiritual power.

556
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,180
He's not good at understanding spiritual skills.

557
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,180
I'm afraid he'll be laughed at by everyone.

558
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,380
I'll let him go.

559
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,180
Since you've taken him as your seat,

560
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,180
you must leave in the Heavenly Palace.

561
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,580
The disciple of the Immortal,

562
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,180
won't you let him go to the palace

563
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,980
to see a gift?

564
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,580
You're hiding it like this.

565
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,380
Is there anything special about this disciple

566
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,980
that you're so familiar with?

567
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,980
Where?

568
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,380
He's very clever and has a very good form.

569
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,180
I want to make some more adjustments before I do.

570
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,980
I'll see you in the Heavenly Lord.

571
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,180
Qing He, what's wrong with your master?

572
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Why did you get so much trouble here?

573
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,180
It's not my master. It's our master.

574
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,380
Yes, our master.

575
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,980
He was scared by the cold.

576
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,380
Master said that he's been feeling

577
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,980
a warm and warm atmosphere for thousands of years.

578
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
He must be very cold.

579
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,380
What is he doing there?

580
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,180
This is a habit that master has been using.

581
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,980
He uses silver and water to soak his feet every day.

582
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,980
He's gone to the cold and has a long way to go.

583
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,980
He's been resting with him.

584
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,980
No wonder he's able to become

585
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,580
a master who has lived for thousands of years.

586
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,980
So he's so well-groomed.

587
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
He must be well-groomed.

588
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,180
You're also well-groomed.

589
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,780
You two come over too.

590
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,380
Okay.

591
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,580
How is it? Is it very comfortable?

592
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,180
Qing He, I'm a bit thirsty.

593
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,380
Get me some water.

594
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,980
I'm a senior, you're a junior.

595
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,180
You should go if you want to take out the water.

596
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,380
I'm older than you. I'm a senior.

597
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,180
You go.

598
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,180
I'll go first. I'm a senior. You go.

599
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,780
Master, what did you drink?

600
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,380
Give me a sip.

601
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,580
What is this?

602
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,180
You dare to drink the tea of master?

603
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,580
Master drinks it at night, but it's a pity.

604
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,980
He drinks it at night?

605
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,180
Then he drinks it in the morning?

606
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,380
Yes. I'll tell you later.

607
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,380
From tomorrow on, you have to learn to prepare tea for master.

608
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,580
Master needs to drink different kinds of tea on a daily basis.

609
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,980
In the morning, he needs to be treated by Bai Yu and Qiong Jiang tea.

610
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,380
He's not angry.

611
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,180
After he goes to bed, he needs to be treated by Yun Shan Shou Mei tea.

612
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,380
He's drunk and has a fever.

613
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,380
Before he goes to bed, he needs to drink the same kind of tea.

614
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,180
Calm down and rest in peace.

615
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,780
You've been living for tens of thousands of years.

616
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,580
You've already passed away.

617
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,180
Why do you still want to raise your child?

618
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,780
The three realms have me live well.

619
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,580
This cultivation and raising of the body is a kind of cultivation.

620
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,460
Level 3 Qiong Jiang

621
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,680
Level 4 Yun Shan

622
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,160
Qinghe, didn't you use the tea only at night?

623
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,360
Why are you still here?

624
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,480
You only use it before the road is blocked.

625
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,360
Hurry and go.

626
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,640
I'll go.

627
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,640
If I can't use it well,

628
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,200
I'll ruin your master's tea.

629
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,080
You go. I'll learn it later.

630
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,720
What's the use of using the tea?

631
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,640
You know each other.

632
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,240
I'll go back to prepare the tea.

633
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,440
Come back early.

634
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,720
Don't let him lose his mind

635
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,880
and make his master angry.

636
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,600
Let's go.

637
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Don't go.

638
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,440
I'll go back and prepare the tea.

639
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,480
You stay here.

640
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,240
Why do I feel like

641
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,040
you're afraid of what?

642
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,360
Are you afraid of water?

643
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,600
Aren't you a carpenter?

644
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,440
I've lived for so long.

645
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,480
It's the first time I know

646
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,080
fish are afraid of water.

647
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,000
Nonsense.

648
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
I'm not afraid of water.

649
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,080
It's just that the road is blocked.

650
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,920
I'm afraid of the cold.

651
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,680
How can you be so angry

652
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,720
to make money with your master?

653
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,440
No.

654
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,560
You must be back today.

655
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm your senior.

656
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
I can't be the one

657
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,680
who can't take care of you.

658
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,240
Alright.

659
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,200
I have to prepare the tea for my master.

660
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,960
Go early.

661
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,040
Come back early after the tea.

662
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,800
Don't be greedy.

663
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,280
Bye.

664
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
Bai Yan.

665
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
It's all your fault.

666
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,880
What's the matter?

667
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
How can I see this?

668
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,600
The Yuzhu is afraid of water the most.

669
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,720
I'll die.

670
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,120
Master, you're up.

671
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,320
I'll prepare the tea.

672
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,160
Why are you alone?

673
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,800
Where's Yihua?

674
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,320
I asked her to collect the lotus seeds.

675
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,200
She's got water.

676
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,920
Yes.

677
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,160
Bai Yan.

678
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,840
Hurry.

679
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,480
Come and save me.

680
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,280
I'm sorry.

684
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,200
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
I'm sorry.

686
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
I'm sorry.

687
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm sorry.

689
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm sorry.

691
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I'm sorry.

692
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
I'm sorry.

693
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
I'm sorry.

694
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
I'm sorry.

695
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
I'm sorry.

696
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
I'm sorry.

697
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
I'm sorry.

698
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm sorry.

699
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
I'm sorry.

700
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
I'm sorry.

701
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I'm sorry.

702
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
I'm sorry.

703
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I'm sorry.

704
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm sorry.

705
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm sorry.

706
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
I'm sorry.

707
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I'm sorry.

708
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm sorry.

709
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Bai Yan.

710
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I finally understand

711
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
why my master bring you back.

712
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,200
You've known it all.

713
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,200
Do you know

714
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,080
what is the most千ye琳

715
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,240
in the world?

716
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
What?

717
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,260
Kneel blocks.

718
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
Out commerical fish.

719
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,020
Although you're an accurate priest,

720
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,100
you have always had in your eyes.

721
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
This matter is not on my head.

722
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
No.

723
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
It's not on anyone's head.

724
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
It can't be accepted.

725
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Then what can't be accepted?

726
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
This time, you were wrong.

727
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,100
I didn't expect that Yu Xian would actually be so mean.

728
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Didn't you just do it?

729
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
No, it was your master who did it.

730
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
It was also your master.

731
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Forget it.

732
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Where is Bai Yan?

733
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Where is he?

734
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
The Heavenly Palace is so dangerous.

735
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
I can't take him with me.

736
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
How dare you to accuse master of being evil?

737
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
I said I can't leave.

738
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Since you returned to the Heavenly Palace,

739
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
you have been thanking all the gods for your worship.

740
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Why are you here today?

741
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
I invited you here.

742
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,100
I've been in the military circle for a thousand years.

743
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
I should be more careful.

744
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Bai Yan,

745
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
you are not a person who knows how to be polite.

746
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Just say it if you need anything.

747
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
If that's the case, I'll just say it.

748
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
You once told me that

749
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,100
you had a white rain spirit fan under the ice.

750
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Could you give it to me?

751
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,100
What do you want that spirit fan for?

752
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
If not,

753
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
you would have felt the movement of the spirit fan

754
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
under the ice.

755
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Qing He wanted it.

756
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
You saw him grow up.

757
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,100
You also understand that he doesn't want to talk to me.

758
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Qing He wants it, of course there's no problem.

759
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,100
But I still have to find out the movement of Li Jing Tian.

760
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,100
Is there anything related to that white rain spirit fan?

761
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Spirit fan?

762
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,100
What spirit fan did you say?

763
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Shut up.

764
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
Don't be rude.

765
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Qing He, take her down.

766
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
What spirit fan did you say is...

767
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
This is the disciple you just said.

768
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,100
It looks like he's more playful than Qing He.

769
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Qing He.

770
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,100
Qing He,

771
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
I've just asked the God of Yuan You

772
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,100
to ask you for your favorite spirit fan.

773
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
It's just that this spirit fan is not very important.

774
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,100
So I'll just put it aside for now.

775
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,100
It's just a white rain spirit fan.

776
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
If you want it,

777
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
you can take it for a few days.

778
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Thank you, God of Yuan You.

779
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,100
Let's go.

780
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
Can you let me have a good heart?

781
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
It's not embarrassing enough.

782
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Qing He,

783
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
you go down first.

784
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Yes.

785
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Since the spirit fan is not with you,

786
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
why did you lie to me in the heaven?

787
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
I've never said that the white rain spirit fan is with me.

788
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Okay.

789
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,100
Then you promised me that you'd help me find the white rain spirit fan.

790
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
If that's the case,

791
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
my fan is with that god.

792
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Why can't I take it back by myself?

793
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Then how are you going to take it?

794
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,100
The face of the Heavenly Lord said that the white rain spirit fan is yours.

795
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
That's right.

796
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
It was mine.

797
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
Then where did you throw the fan?

798
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
You...

799
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Okay, I know.

800
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
I broke into the barrier.

801
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
I was going to be killed by the ten-spirit thunder.

802
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
I don't want to bear the thunder.

803
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
But that spirit fan is very important to me.

804
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
I must find it back.

805
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,100
I've said that I'll find the white rain spirit fan for you.

806
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,100
But from now on,

807
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
you have to take out the silver flower palace.

808
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,100
Why?

809
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Don't tell me you still want to get rid of it?

810
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Do you still want to get rid of it?

811
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
If you really want to get out,

812
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,100
I have to follow you.

813
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
How about this?

814
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

815
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Goodbye.

816
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

817
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

818
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

819
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

820
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

821
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

822
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100

823
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

824
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

825
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

826
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

827
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,100
I'll take you to Mount Wuya tomorrow.

828
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,100
