1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Always

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There is no miracle, no miracle, the waves are in the river

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The falling flowers are flowing, no water is no shadow

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The flowers of life are like dreams, like you

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no breath, no breath

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The history is not clear

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain of another life

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll wait for you in the next life

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll wait for you

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I knew you were dead

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why didn't you wake up?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
See?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a kind of poison

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's poison in your chest

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mo Xiao

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can get through the gold vein

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But you're like a dead person

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're going to die

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tell me

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You must want to know where this is

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why am I here?

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Right?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's long to say this

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There is such a big change in your Mount of Shushan

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can't hate the world

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now the devil and the immortal are looking for you

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They can't think of me

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They found you first

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I've sealed your spiritual power and magic power

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
They can't find you in a moment

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Why did you save me?

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You shouldn't have saved me

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Should I save you?

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm old-fashioned

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now you're my old-fashioned life

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
From now on, you'll be obedient

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And take care of your wounds

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They can't find you in this place

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're my son

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Mo Xiao

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're not a devil

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If he's not a devil

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How could I have three lives?

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He is a devil

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Devil?

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I didn't expect I'd be 18 years old

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But I found out I'm a devil

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I even wanted to kill myself

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But you saved me

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mo Xiao

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mo Xiao

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Where are you going?

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's out

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He's out

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You...

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're afraid of me?

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're afraid of me?

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're afraid of me?

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He's afraid of me?

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's afraid of me?

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's afraid of me?

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You all were cartoons?

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're afraid if you scared me

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You would come to me

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Then you're afraid if you're afraid of me

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,160
Then you're afraid that I don't

86
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,880
Do it.

87
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,600
Do it.

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
Hit me and kill me.

89
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,720
I won't return my hand.

90
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Do it.

91
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Is he crazy?

92
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,720
Why can't he move?

93
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
What are you waiting for?

94
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Do you know who I am?

95
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
I am the Demon Lord.

96
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,840
I am the Demon Lord's son.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,880
If you kill me,

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you will have merit.

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,520
You will have great merit.

100
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
What are you waiting for?

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,600
Come on.

102
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,720
Come on.

103
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
Come on.

104
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,200
You can't let me go.

105
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,960
Come on, come on.

106
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,520
How dare youlaugh at a patient!

107
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,320
What do you mean?

108
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
I said, Wolfie.

109
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,400
You're already one hundred years old.

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
Why are you still so ugly?

111
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
You didn't say anything.

112
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,280
You went to the spiritual temple first.

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
You've been the chief of the old group for so many years.

114
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,760
You're not even a little bit older.

115
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
Elder Hu Xin.

116
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,480
Why are you back again

117
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,520
after so many years?

118
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,960
Don't call me Elder.

119
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,080
I'm not your Elder anymore.

120
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm a doctor now.

121
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,560
I have a patient.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm here to cure him

123
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,560
to cure him.

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
I have to come back.

125
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,880
I said, Wolfie.

126
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,880
Don't think I'm here to see you.

127
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,280
I'm not interested in you.

128
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
It's him.

129
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,520
I've cured him.

130
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,280
You just got the spiritual temple account.

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
You killed him again.

132
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,600
You have to take responsibility for this.

133
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,040
A person who wants to die

134
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
and Elder Hu Xin,

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
what's the use of saving him?

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
I said,

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,560
don't call me Elder.

138
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,120
And,

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,720
saving him is my old man's happiness.

140
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,080
He wants to die and live.

141
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
Anyway, my old man has a way

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,840
to save him.

143
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,040
Elder.

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,160
Doctor.

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
What doctor?

146
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,960
I'll call you Elder.

147
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,120
Elder.

148
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,720
I...

149
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,040
Elder Hu Xin.

150
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,840
What...

151
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,760
Elder Seventh.

152
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,120
You knew a person

153
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,880
won't survive in me.

154
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,640
A Jackle can rise on you.

155
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,840
He can't.

156
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,720
What?

157
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,000
Can't?

158
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,040
Wolfie,

159
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,660
the Dijian Water Department

160
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,360
broke into you

161
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,040
on the path of moving water Hadiments.

162
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,640
Don't you dare to be interested in who he is?

163
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,680
A person who wants to die doesn't matter to anyone.

164
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,400
He is just a dead man.

165
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,480
What else can you expect?

166
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
Throw him out of the jade village.

167
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay.

168
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,200
I am Xiao Nantou.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,800
You are going to kill me, right?

170
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,240
Don't forget.

171
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
You were just a butt and were touching fish in the river.

172
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
Your father raised a stick and hit you everywhere.

173
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,000
I didn't take care of you.

174
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
Now you are a bandit.

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
You don't want to put me in your eyes.

176
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
Where are you going to throw me?

177
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,740
Stewards.

178
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,700
Stewards.

179
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
Stewards.

180
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,600
Be careful.

181
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,880
Go away, go away.

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
Be careful like you areassic.

183
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,800
You strength.

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,960
Okay.

185
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,320
Go, go away.

186
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,360
Be careful.

187
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,600
Okay.

188
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
The wedding?

189
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,240
On the day of the ancestral hall, I had announced to everyone that

190
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Li Xue was my son-in-law.

191
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,240
But I also owe her a wedding ceremony.

192
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Master, didn't you say that you would wait for the Heavenly Demon Order to open

193
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,240
and summon 100,000 Heavenly Demons to offer a wedding ceremony for your son-in-law?

194
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Mo Xiao is missing.

195
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,240
The Heavenly Demon Order cannot be opened at any time.

196
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Is it possible that my wedding ceremony will be held again?

197
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
No matter when the Lord will be here,

198
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
it will be the wedding ceremony that I, the Heavenly Demon, have called.

199
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,240
But, Master, the four elders who have been working on the wedding ceremony

200
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm afraid that we have to take care of them first.

201
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Where are they?

202
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Outside the hall.

203
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
The Heavenly Demon Order cannot be opened.

204
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,240
On the mountain of Mount Zu, they have sent out the body of the son of Ye Yuan.

205
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Of course, they cannot be opened.

206
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,240
I didn't expect that they would come so soon.

207
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Then, do you want to see them?

208
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Of course, I do.

209
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,240
The four elders suddenly came to visit today.

210
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I think that they heard the rumors about the son of Ye Yuan.

211
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Master, you are right.

212
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Ever since I heard that the son of Ye Yuan is still alive,

213
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,240
it has been the new leader of Mount Zu, Mo Xiao.

214
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I was so surprised.

215
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I also heard that Mo Xiao was killed by Mount Zu by the secret box.

216
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Now, the people of Mount Zu are looking for Mo Xiao all over the world.

217
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,240
The day before yesterday, we received the secret letter from the Chief of the Yao Lin Palace.

218
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,240
We will look for the son of Ye Yuan together.

219
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
We are so worried about the son of Ye Yuan.

220
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,240
We don't know how to make a mistake.

221
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Please, please respect the son of Ye Yuan.

222
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
There are so many nonsense.

223
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
You just want to ask me

224
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,240
whether you should look for the son of Ye Yuan?

225
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I have always followed the Tian Mo Clan to follow the order of the Tian Mo Clan.

226
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,240
But on that day, the Chief of the ancestral hall didn't open the order of the Tian Mo Clan.

227
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Now, with the Young Master's presence,

228
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,240
we don't know how to control ourselves.

229
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
This is...

230
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Enough.

231
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
What's so difficult about this?

232
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Since you are the Young Master of the Tian Mo Clan,

233
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,240
I, the Tian Mo Clan, will naturally look for the person.

234
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
But Chief, have you ever thought about it?

235
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,240
If the Young Master returns to Mount Zu,

236
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm afraid the position of the Demon Lord of the Chief will be in danger.

237
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
That's right.

238
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
What do you mean?

239
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Chief, the Tian Mo Clan is in danger.

240
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,240
The Demon Lord of the Chief is the Chief of the Tian Mo Clan.

241
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Now, the Tian Mo Clan is in Chief's hands.

242
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,240
If Chief can open the order of the Tian Mo Clan,

243
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,240
we will naturally be the Chief of the Tian Mo Clan.

244
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,240
But if the Demon Lord of the Chief can only open it with the Mo Xiao?

245
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Chief, I've said that

246
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,240
the Qi Dong of the Chief of the Tian Mo Clan is the Chief of the Tian Mo Clan.

247
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
I understand.

248
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,240
You mean, as long as Mo Xiao can open the order of the Tian Mo Clan,

249
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
you will transfer it to him as the Chief, right?

250
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Great.

251
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Since you have opened the Ministry of the City this way,

252
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,240
I'd rather tell you about the affairs of the Tian Mo Clan.

253
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,240
The Tian Mo Clan can only open it with the Mo Xiao?

254
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
But you must also know that Mo Xiao is a young and virtuous man

255
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,240
who has been taught by Feng Yue for many years.

256
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,240
You think that he will lead you to get the order of the Tian Qiu?

257
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
No, he won't.

258
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,240
He will lead you to get the order of the Tian Qiu?

259
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Will he lead you to get the order of the Tian Qiu?

260
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Will he beat up the Tian Mo Clan?

261
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,240
So this is the mysterious magic order of the Tian Qiu?

262
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,240
I'll wait for the death to follow the Chief.

263
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Remember,

264
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
you can get the order of the Tian Qiu.

265
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Only I can get the order of the Tian Qiu.

266
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I'll follow the Chief.

267
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Chief,

268
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
I'll follow the Chief.

269
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Only I can get the order of the Tian Qiu.

270
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Yes, Chief.

271
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Li Xue.

272
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Li Xue, I'm Yun Chao.

273
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
When will you wake up?

274
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
If you still can't wake up,

275
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
you'll be the Honorable Empress.

276
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
You won't be able to go back then.

277
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
I'm not going back.

278
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
I didn't expect that Mo Xiao

279
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,240
was the brother I searched for more than ten years with my mother.

280
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
He is the son of Ye Yuan.

281
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
But since that day,

282
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
after he was seriously injured and was beaten to death,

283
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,240
he was still alive and not known to the world.

284
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
You see,

285
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
if he was still alive,

286
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
would he have come to know about your wedding?

287
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Xu Yuan,

288
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
why are you here?

289
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm here to visit the Chief.

290
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
I'll visit him.

291
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
I'll visit him.

292
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Your brother is not well.

293
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,240
I'm sure that Xu Yuan must be in pain.

294
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
You're not at home to accompany him.

295
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
You're here to visit the Chief.

296
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,240
My mother has already been ill.

297
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
But Yun Chao doesn't want to see her illness.

298
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
He's going to the mountain to look for her.

299
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
But I heard that the Chief is going to hold a grand ceremony.

300
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I'm afraid that the Crown Prince won't attend.

301
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
He's here to attend.

302
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I understand.

303
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
But I think

304
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
you don't have to be so arrogant.

305
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Li Xue is going to become the heir to the world.

306
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
If your brother is alive,

307
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
I believe that he will find a way to come to Su Yushan.

308
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
You want to take her out?

309
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Yes.

310
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
In your current situation,

311
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,240
where else can she go except for Su Yushan?

312
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I understand what you mean.

313
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
But we still have to do what we should do.

314
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
I'll take my leave.

315
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Yixuan.

316
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
It's time to try on your clothes.

317
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Do you know them?

318
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Fengyue Sword.

319
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Fengyue Sword Mo Xiao.

320
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I took her away before the Demon Palace.

321
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Now, Fengyue Sword and you are all here with me.

322
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I guess she will come to take her.

323
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,240
But when she returns to Su Yushan

324
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
and becomes the Young Master,

325
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
you are already my son-in-law.

326
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Since you two have met,

327
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,240
why don't you leave this sword to me?

328
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
I'll take care of it.

329
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
When she returns to Su Yushan,

330
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
we'll return it to her together.

331
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Okay?

332
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I said, Wolf Boy,

333
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
you are so cruel.

334
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
Do you really want to kick her out?

335
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Do you know that those people outside

336
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
are waiting for the King and the Fish to go to the palace?

337
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Do you know that?

338
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I mean you.

339
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
When our men in Yuzun

340
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
never fall,

341
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
they all know that

342
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
they are more important than life and death.

343
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,240
They will never allow themselves to be the coward.

344
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
Since you don't want to leave,

345
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
then learn how to beg for life

346
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
for our men in our village.

347
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
I mean you.

348
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Okay, okay.

349
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
I won't tell you.

350
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I won't tell you.

351
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Wolf Boy, are you okay?

352
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Are you okay?

353
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
One, two.

354
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
One, two.

355
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Come on, let's do it.

356
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
One, two.

357
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
One, two.

358
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Come on, let's do it.

359
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
One, two.

360
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Come on, let's do it.

361
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
One, two.

362
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
I said, Wolf Boy,

363
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
What are you doing all the time?

364
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Water is fire and love is fire.

365
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Although Li Shui River is long-term waterless,

366
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
it is hard to keep it safe.

367
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
When my daughter and my family are in danger,

368
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240

402
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Little boy, how is it?

403
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Thank you, brother.

404
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Thank you, brother.

405
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Are you okay?

406
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Thank you.

407
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Little boy, you're still in the way.

408
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm really worried that this boy

409
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
will die in your village

410
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,240
in a chaotic and chaotic way.

411
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Little boy, you have to know

412
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,240
that this boy has been a great playboy

413
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
since he was a kid.

414
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I said, are you so willing to let him do this?

415
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
If I'm not wrong,

416
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
this kind of suffering

417
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
is the punishment you'll be punished

418
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
by your village men.

419
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,240
It's better than suffering from skin and flesh.

420
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Don't worry about him.

421
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Little boy,

422
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,240
you said that the rain season is coming.

423
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,240
You've been doing so much for the debt.

424
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
Is this necessary?

425
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
It's not necessary.

426
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
It's not necessary.

427
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
You...

428
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Little boy, time to eat.

429
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Time to eat.

430
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Thank you.

431
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Come on, eat.

432
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Everyone, thank you.

433
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Come on, eat.

434
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
They're all like the evil wolf.

435
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Why are you hiding?

436
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
If you don't come,

437
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
they'll steal the light.

438
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Thank you.

439
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I won't eat.

440
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
You're doing so much work.

441
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
How can you not eat?

442
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Eat. You must eat.

443
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Come on, eat while it's hot.

444
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
You said that the old group leader

445
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
made everyone repair the land so early this year.

446
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
What's the reason?

447
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Why?

448
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
To make these gold-shaped men work again.

449
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
If they don't work,

450
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
we'll have to fight.

451
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
You didn't have time to do that?

452
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Yes.

453
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Yes.

454
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
These days,

455
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
we can't fight anymore.

456
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Yes.

457
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
What should we do?

458
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
I heard from the patrols that

459
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
is having a grand ceremony.

461
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
To welcome the seven-leafed elders

462
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240

463
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240

was sealed.

465
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
It's been a few days.

AKO, go back and take a rest.

515
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680

00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,920
your character will live a miserable life.

00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,820
the joy of this world?

560
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,820
Why?

561
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,820
No!

562
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,820
I don't want you to be my puppet.

563
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,820
I want you to be my lover.

564
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,820
I want you to talk to me.

565
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,820
I want you to smile at me.

566
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,820
I can never be happy about something that has been broken.

567
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,820
The beautiful things can only rely on themselves.

568
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,820
I try to create them.

569
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,820
It's okay.

570
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,820
As long as you and I are together,

571
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,820
and the three lives' power is at the same level,

572
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,820
I believe that the power of the mortal world

573
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,820
can be eliminated.

574
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,820
We can...

575
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,820
I'm willing to let the rain fall.

576
00:36:52,820 --> 00:37:02,820
I'll stay in the mountains and the water.

577
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Thanks, you two.

578
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,820
Let's go.

579
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,820
Everyone wants you two to stay here.

580
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,820
Let's go.

581
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,140
Let him escort her.

582
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,080
Meng Xiao!

583
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,160
Meng Xiao!

584
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,800
It is scared to death, right?

585
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,840
But, what?

586
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,020
He really forgives me!

587
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,640
Let me go!

588
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,220
WNo bell,

589
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,780
not in reasonable order.

590
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:24,060
B厉害

591
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,080
There is a young man

592
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,240
pretty brave.

593
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,200
You...

594
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,480
Mo Xiao.

595
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,720
You cried?

596
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,640
Why?

597
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,680
Speak.

598
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,480
Did you hear what others said?

599
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,000
I told you.

600
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,160
You can't let you know about this.

601
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,200
You're not in the best of condition.

602
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,120
You won't be able to bear the tragedy.

603
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,600
Look.

604
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,600
Mo Xiao.

605
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,960
You can't give up your life.

606
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,280
Just live.

607
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,280
What do you mean?

608
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,160
What are you talking about?

609
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,840
You're not doing this for your master?

610
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
My master?

611
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
What's wrong with him?

612
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,640
Your master, Yuan Beichen, is dead.

613
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,560
What are you talking about?

614
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm not talking nonsense.

615
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
It's true.

616
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,880
My master is dead?

617
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,560
How could my master die?

618
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,120
How could my master die?

619
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Why do you lie to me?

620
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,480
I'm not lying to you.

621
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,680
Yuan Beichen, your master, is dead.

622
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,040
I heard that

623
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,280
two disciples in his sect

624
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,880
are the same as Mo Xiao.

625
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,600
One is a disciple of the same name.

626
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,000
The other is a demon.

627
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,600
The other is a demon.

628
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,520
So,

629
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,360
he is called the demon of the Shushan Sect.

630
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,080
He committed suicide

631
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,960
for the sake of his sin.

632
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,200
And,

633
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,720
the new sect leader, Murong Changfeng,

634
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,640
has closed the sect of Run Tian.

635
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,760
Yuan Beichen's body

636
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,960
is also thrown to the Soul Valley.

637
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,040
All the disciples of the sect

638
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,120
are going to the Soul Valley to guard the sect.

639
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,440
Don't you know?

640
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,800
Why are you crying?

641
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,440
Impossible.

642
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Impossible.

643
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,400
I'm going to ask him.

644
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,280
Mo Xiao, where are you going?

645
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,040
Where are you going?

646
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,880
I meant,

647
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,600
the guy has a heart surgery.

648
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,160
Hold this.

649
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,400
Hurry up.

650
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,800
Slow Cathie,

651
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,560
I'm going to get doctors here.

652
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,440
Tell me.

653
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,960
I'm going to ask on behalf of the sect leader,

654
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,040
the code was not valid.

655
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
He had gone.

656
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,720
Do you want me to test it?

657
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,920
My Grand Master.

658
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,400
No.

659
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,520
I have to talk to Mu Rong Changfeng.

660
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,480
Don't go.

661
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,120
Junior Sister.

662
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
You never care about the internal affairs.

663
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,880
It's really different this time.

664
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,480
Brother Yuan has committed suicide and committed suicide.

665
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,040
But Mu Rong Changfeng is still ungrateful.

666
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,760
No.

667
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,160
I have to ask for justice for him.

668
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,840
Senior Brother.

669
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,000
Senior Brother, we don't need to do anything for him.

670
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,360
Senior Brother said it himself.

671
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,000
Is it because he knew he was lively?

672
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,400
Waiting for you?

673
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:45,400
The soul is in the dark, the fire is burning, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the moon is in the dark, the

674
00:42:45,400 --> 00:43:03,040
fire burn, the 다� is worn bride, love gets you wrong, ruined your life, focused on love

675
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,680
Love can't come, it can't be alone

676
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:45,840
The thousand ways of life are like the world, not willing to wake up

677
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,280
The clouds are scattered, the clouds are open, the mountains are dark

678
00:43:52,280 --> 00:44:00,960
Turn around, every time we go round and round looking for knowfoldings

679
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:08,300
The past is like the cutless stage in the evening. Hurry up and pay όgrwhile she mentally olla

680
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,380
The twilight picks up my worry, the river and the water do not fear

681
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,700
Suddenly, the noisiest of life's life
