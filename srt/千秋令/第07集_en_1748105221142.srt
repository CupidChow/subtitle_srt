1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the wind, the moon is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Always

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The wind blows, the fog blows, the waves blow

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The wind blows, the river flows

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The falling flowers blow, the water flows, the shadow flows

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The flowers of life

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Like a dream, like you

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no breath

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No joy, no tears, no emotion

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Another life, rain, wait for the next

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Wait for you, wait for you

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Does it matter if it's mine or not?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is it your business?

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you don't give it to me, you'll be a rich man

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's talk about it later

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, it's late, I should get up

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You must be careful on your way back

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't be found

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't worry

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing with me?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll take Xue'er with me in this journey

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Go back

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't follow me

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's over

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The most promising painter in Mount Zu

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
is going to destroy the dance on a girl's hand

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Master

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ye Yun said I was the god of the nine heavens

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I will never die

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's the heaven's grace and grace to me

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's the curse

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you still want me to feel the glory for this?

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What I want is not to die forever

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What I want is to be together for three generations

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Master

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are lawless and you will be together for three generations

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How is it?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Did you bring back good news for me?

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I think the mountain is starting to investigate Xue'er

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you want it?

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's just the first time I asked the way

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I found the way

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What else do you care about?

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But master, you have been to Mount Meng after all

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:08,520
You can't find my

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's the position of the young master

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You are done?

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll pack it up

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't you want to eat?

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll take me to eat

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I knew you must be bored in this place

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I brought you my real painting

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How is it? Is it good?

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's really good

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But when will you give me a new one?

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll finish reading it right away

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll bring you a new one tomorrow

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If you really like it

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll take you to the mountain

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To the biggest bookstore in Fengdu City

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
To borrow your new painting

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But Mo Xiao won't let me go down the mountain

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You listen to her painting

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Of course I want to listen to her painting

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But you are sick

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You still have to leave here

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She is the future leader of Mount Shu

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She can't marry you

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't need her to marry me

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Just stay with her

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You are really a liar

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you like her very much?

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you like her very much?

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What do you like?

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How can I explain it to you?

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like?

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you like her

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You feel very comfortable

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
She is very relieved

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She is the only one for you

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In this world

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
She is the only one for you

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You just want to be with her

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You just want to be with her

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's what you like

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then I like her

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's over

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's over

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's time to change your name

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's over

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Who are you?

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I am Zisu

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The guardian of the sect leader

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You are Mo Xiao's guardian

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But he told me that there is a barrier here

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No one can come

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He told you to come

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't need to bother you

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have the gift and the painting

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Xie Lin Yun gave me

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's enough

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't need to accompany me

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The guardian of the sect leader may be afraid that you will stay here

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's too lonely

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am used to being alone in Mount Mang

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You don't need to accompany me

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mount Mang?

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is he the demon of Mount Mang?

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No wonder the guardian of the sect leader is so strange

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No wonder the guardian of the sect leader is so strange

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If the guardian of the sect leader is the demon of Mount Mang

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The guardian of the sect leader is going to be punished

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No, I can't let him stay here

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's it

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The guardian of the sect leader told me

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He told me to take you to the Heaven's Garden

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Heaven's Garden?

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But he didn't say that before

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Maybe the guardian of the sect leader is out

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He is worried that he will take care of you

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
At least we can take care of him

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Didn't you like to eat glutinous rice?

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Have you eaten it? I made it

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You made the glutinous rice?

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then you will be really inconvenient to send it to me

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then I will go with you

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No, wait a minute

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wait until it's done, I will take you there

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Xue'er

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Xue'er

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Xue'er

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Xue'er

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Senior Brother Lu

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I told the sect leader

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I found a girl who is good at breaking into the forbidden land

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I told her that this is the sect leader's practice

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I told her to leave quickly

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But she insisted that she wouldn't leave

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And she said that the sect leader is not famous

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
She is a good girl

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Nonsense

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Bring her up

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Zisu, why did you bring me here?

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Who are you?

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why do you want to break into the forbidden land of Shu?

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think I understand

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Mo Xiao didn't ask you to come to me

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You are lying to me

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Do you know how to do it?

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Do you know Mo Xiao?

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Who are you?

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I am Wu Chen

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why do you want to come here?

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You break into the forbidden land of Shu

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What is your intention?

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What are you doing?

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I said that I am not good at breaking into the forbidden land

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Mo Xiao brought me here

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The sect leader is so considerate

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How could he bring you here?

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why did you take him here?

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You are so innocent

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please leave

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Zisu will leave

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Zisu

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't be angry

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He is a weak girl

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He can break into the forbidden land of Shu

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It is a miracle

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Sister

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Please confirm

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Brother

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This girl is not suspicious

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She is a mortal girl

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Since she is a mortal

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
She is not a threat to me

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So she is going to deal with Zisu

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Zisu

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Take her down the mountain

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes, I will

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mo Xiao brought me here

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will go with Mo Xiao

203
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Since you know I am not dangerous

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I will go back to Xuanqing courtyard

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Stop

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The sect leader has ordered you to go down the mountain

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Where do you want to go?

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Just go with me

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Stop

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes, he is him

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He is the demon girl of Mount Wang

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Jianchuan

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What is going on?

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Master, the village people of Mount Wang are not so big

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He used the magic to poison this girl

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He used the magic to poison the village people

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The villagers were trapped

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They killed her

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What?

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But the sect leader has been protecting this girl

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He is trying to escape

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Now the sect leaders found her hiding in Xuanqing courtyard

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Is it true?

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I went to Mount Wang to investigate

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It is true

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If he is really a demon girl

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will not let him go

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Brother

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I have confirmed

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This girl is really a demon girl

232
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Maybe this girl has practiced the magic to poison the girl

233
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She has hidden the demon girl

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Maybe this girl has practiced the magic to poison the girl

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Since there is a village name in Mount Wang

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Since there is a village name in Mount Wang

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Let's put her in the iron door first

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Brother

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's wait for Mo Xiao to come back

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No need

241
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Take her up and put her in the iron door

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I want to wait for Mo Xiao to come back

244
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I came here for Mo Xiao

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I didn't harm you

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why did you do this to me?

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I thought you were her accomplices

248
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I didn't want to hurt you

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you treat me like this

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I won't interfere with Qi Ling

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You are so arrogant

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I have never killed innocent people

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why do you come to Qi Ling?

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Are you a demon girl?

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
As long as you enter the iron door

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There will be a result

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Take her away

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I will wait for Mo Xiao to come back

259
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I will protect myself

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you treat me like this

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't blame me for being impolite

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Demon girl

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You are

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You are

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
More than me

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Mo Xiao

267
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Mo Xiao

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You are finally back

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Master

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Mo Xiao

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's time for you to come back

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This matter is urgent

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I will go back to the iron door

274
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I will wait for you

275
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I will wait for you

276
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I will wait for you

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I will wait for you

278
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I will wait for you

279
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I will wait for you

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's time for you to come back

281
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What do you explain?

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Zisu

283
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Master

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This girl is innocent

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
She was poisoned by the demon girl

286
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
when I fought with her

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
As a disciple of Mount Shu

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I want to be the best for the world

289
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I can't ignore her

290
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I brought her back

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I will send her to the white grass door

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Why do you hide her in the Xuanqing Ruin?

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Master

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You just saw it

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Her coldness will be exposed

296
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It will become a cold place around

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
For the sake of prevention

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
She hurt innocent people and the people

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So she brought her back

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
She will find a cure for her own condition

301
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Master

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can testify this

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You know this too?

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Master

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You told me this

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So I found a cure

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I am not a demon girl

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I am not a demon girl

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Brother

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Master

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I did get it

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But I really don't know

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
how to find it

314
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I just sent her to the rice field

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I didn't go back to the iron gate

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I knew it

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I really don't know

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Master

320
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's me

321
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Zisu, what are you talking about?

322
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
How do you know about me?

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Actually, I felt weird

324
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
when you asked me to find the rice field

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Master Xie asked me to find the rice field

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I felt weird

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So I followed her

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and found that she went to Xuanqing Ruin

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Follow me?

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Master

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
When you just went back to Mount Zu

332
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Someone sent you to the Mount Mang

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
to protect a demon girl

334
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
When I saw the dust

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I understood

336
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know I want to keep a dust

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why did you want to take her down the mountain?

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because I can't let her destroy the front gate

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What do you mean?

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Master

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You have the authority to keep her from the mountain

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Xuanqing Ruin is the holy place

343
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can't even step into the mountain

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
when you saw the place of the cultivation

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You just hide her from the demon girl

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Besides

347
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What?

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The dust

349
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You just said

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
that she was suspicious of you

351
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If you really

352
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
tell the master

353
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
that you are going to be the mountain

354
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you will be the laughing stock

355
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We three

356
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
have been together for ten years

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,520
I can't just watch that

358
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
demon girl destroy you

359
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Master, it's all because of Zisu

360
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I was afraid that I would send her away

361
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
and you would blame Zisu

362
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
So I thought if I let the master know

363
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I would take the girl to the mountain

364
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
and send her down the mountain

365
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
I didn't want to hurt her

366
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
I didn't expect that

367
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Senior Lu would bring the people of Mount Mang

368
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
to destroy you and protect the demon girl

369
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Sect Leader

370
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Sect Leader

371
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Sect Leader, please go to the Sword Pavilion

372
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Sword Pavilion?

373
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
In the Pavilion

374
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
didn't the master

375
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
already know about this?

376
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Why did he suddenly let you go to the Sword Pavilion?

377
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
The Sword Pavilion is a holy place

378
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
If it wasn't for the sect's great power

379
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
the master wouldn't have sent the Sword Pavilion

380
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
It happened so quickly

381
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
It was indeed my fault

382
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
I should be punished

383
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
I, Mo Xiao, am here to punish you

384
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Why should I be punished?

385
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
I didn't tell the master about it

386
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
I should be punished

387
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Then is there any other way

388
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
to control the demon girl?

389
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
I was also caught

390
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
I sent your senior to the Sword Pavilion

391
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
to investigate secretly

392
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Since you have doubts

393
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
why don't you discuss with me

394
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
but you have to make a decision?

395
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I am not sure

396
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Please punish me

397
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Could it be

398
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
you have feelings for that woman?

399
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I have feelings for her

400
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
I have been practicing in the Sword Pavilion

401
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
I have been practicing in the Sword Pavilion

402
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,580
I ran into the trouble. I would never see my body

403
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
This life's not that bad

404
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
You are such a girl

405
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
No rush

406
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
You have nothing to add in it

407
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Fine

408
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,540
You at the front of the premises of the Sword Pavilion

409
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,560
and praise the God The Spirit of Sword Pavilion

410
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
Greetings, ein especial dedicatee

411
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I will wait

412
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,280
I, Mo Xiao, am here to inform you.

413
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,520
This is the order of the past.

414
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,920
Pass on the precepts.

415
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,120
Don't be too hasty.

416
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
Don't be too hasty.

417
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,720
Don't be too hasty.

418
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,320
I will take care of it.

419
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,720
Master, what order do you have for me to send the letter?

420
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
I'm not sending it to Mo Xiao.

421
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,920
The Young Master was sent by the Sect Leader to lock up the Sword Pavilion.

422
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,320
So...

423
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,920
Master, what's wrong with him?

424
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,720
We must immediately send him the precepts to enter his body.

425
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
To protect his heart.

426
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Master, he seems to be getting more and more uncomfortable.

427
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Zi Su, I'm going to give him a break.

428
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,120
Pass on the precepts. Don't be too hasty. Don't be too hasty.

429
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,520
Rest and don't be too hasty.

430
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Pass on the precepts. Don't be too hasty. Don't be too hasty.

431
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Rest and don't be too hasty.

432
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,120
This is the Three Demented Kinship complex.

433
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,420
He just loves to give the magnets,

434
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,220
Just like how he just said Those are the meanest gifts.

435
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,000
Poet.

436
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,820
You...

437
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,020
Jealous of Temptation ofenas

438
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,140
Wuchen. Wuchen.

439
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,820
Mo Xiang.

440
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,860
The master asked him to give me the White Grass Sect.

441
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,340
You can't take him away.

442
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,860
His Khan's ID can't be used to eat the internal energy.

443
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,060
Otherwise, he will die.

444
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,260
How do you know?

445
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,540
Uncle.

446
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,100
Let me take him away.

447
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,820
Mo Xiang.

448
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,820
Why can you cure his internal cold poison?

449
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
How did you do it?

450
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,180
Uncle.

451
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,620
You are always not interested in the White Grass Sect.

452
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,940
Let me take him away this time.

453
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,660
He is dying.

454
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,660
I beg you.

455
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,700
No.

456
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,020
I am very interested in this girl now.

457
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,500
I have been in the White Grass Sect for decades.

458
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,380
I have never seen such a strange witness.

459
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,140
I have to find a way to find a solution.

460
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,260
Mo Xiang.

461
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,020
I can't let you take him away.

462
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,860
Wuchen. Wuchen.

463
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,780
You can't save him at all.

464
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,980
Young master.

465
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,220
Why is he so drunk?

466
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,100
This is not true.

467
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,540
Should I mind my own business?

468
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,140
Mo Xiang.

469
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,420
I see.

470
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,120
Young Master.

471
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Jose.

472
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,540
Do you wear the Apple Sister Coin?

473
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,740
No.

474
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,700
Do you need a light?

475
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,860
You need someone like XiaoATafo.

476
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,860
What did you think of?

477
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,860
Do you still remember the 18-year-old girl?

478
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,860
You mean that girl who was born in the past

479
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,860
and was born in the past?

480
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,860
That's right.

481
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,860
That year, Feng Xing Tian was taken away from the Immortal Sect

482
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,860
and married into a female servant.

483
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
She was born into a female servant.

484
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
She was married into a female servant.

485
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,860
Did you think that

486
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Wu Chen was Feng Xing Tian's daughter,

487
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
Feng Lixue?

488
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
What about Mo Xiao?

489
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,860
She's afraid that she has the same idea as I do.

490
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,860
This demon is very powerful.

491
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,860
If anyone in the world uses it to train the demon,

492
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,860
it will be a huge disaster.

493
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,860
I'm afraid that there will be more Feng Xing Tian's flow

494
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
in the future.

495
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,860
I, Shu Shan, will be very lucky.

496
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,860
This child's body has a great power.

497
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,860
I've sealed this power with my spirit.

498
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,860
I'll send it to the Immortal Sect.

499
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
After my father's death,

500
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
I'll protect his heart

501
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
and not let the demon be punished.

502
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,860
If I have a good idea in the future,

503
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,860
I'll protect the descendant of the Immortal Sect

504
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,860
and protect the Immortal Sect.

505
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,860
You're the only one who knows this.

506
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,860
You can't let the second person know.

507
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Is the good idea of the Immortal Sect

508
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
really coming?

509
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
No.

510
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,860
I can't let this happen.

511
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,860
This woman is suspicious.

512
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,860
If she really let Lixue go,

513
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
and she's just a demon,

514
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
I'm afraid that

515
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,860
she'll be punished.

516
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
I only have to let her

517
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,860
enter the Immortal Sect

518
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
to protect her.

519
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,860
The Immortal Sect...

520
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860
The sword in the eye.

521
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,860
The sword in the heart.

522
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,860
I can't let this happen.

523
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Mo Xiao.

524
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
You're awake.

525
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,860
You're back.

526
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,860
I knew you'd come back.

527
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Where is this place?

528
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,860
Why am I here?

529
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,860
This is the Heaven's Garden.

530
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
My room.

531
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Don't worry. It's very safe.

532
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm not afraid.

533
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,860
When someone is chasing after me,

534
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,860
you'll come to save me.

535
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
I know.

536
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,860
It's right to go down the mountain with you.

537
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,860
Actually, they're just my senior brothers.

538
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,860
Because I didn't make it clear,

539
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
I'll be right to you.

540
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
You don't have to explain to me.

541
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,860
I don't care anyway.

542
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,860
Oh, by the way, Wu Chen.

543
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,860
Your Han Zheng is here to report.

544
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,860
It's hard to communicate with everyone about this.

545
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,860
So I'm afraid I can't stay here.

546
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,860
It's because of my Qi'an Zheng.

547
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,860
So they think I'm a demon.

548
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
They want to kill me.

549
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,860
I won't kill innocent people.

550
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,860
But once they recognize you as a demon,

551
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,860
even I can't protect you.

552
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,860
Are you afraid they'll hurt me?

553
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,860
Or are they afraid they'll punish you?

554
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,860
I know.

555
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Mu Xiao.

556
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Am I...

557
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,860
a burden to you?

558
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Senior Brother Lu, what are you doing?

559
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,860
I'm making you the order to take away my innocent daughter, Wu Chen.

560
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
The Heavenly Court is the head of Shao Sect.

561
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,860
It's closed for cultivation.

562
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
Without the head of Shao Sect,

563
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,860
no one can enter the Heavenly Court.

564
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Senior Brother Lu, even if you're the head of Shao Sect,

565
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
you still have to take care of the head of Shao Sect.

566
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,860
You can't take care of the head of Shao Sect.

567
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
You're a demon.

568
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
You're a demon.

569
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
You're a demon.

570
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,860
You're a demon.

571
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Senior Brother Lu, even if you're the head of Shao Sect,

572
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,860
you still have to pass the message outside the Heavenly Court.

573
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,860
You're taking people in like this.

574
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,860
Is there no Shao Sect in your eyes?

575
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,860
Junior Sister Zi Su,

576
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,860
I'm here to take people in the order of the head of Shao Sect.

577
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
It's a crime.

578
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,860
It's a crime to be a criminal.

579
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,860
Please let Senior Brother Lu out of the Heavenly Court.

580
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,860
How can I take people out of the Heavenly Court?

581
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
You're forcing me to fight.

582
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Who wants to break into the Heavenly Court?

583
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:21,860
GOär13

584
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,860
The order is medicated by Master Dao is to lead my daughter, Wu Chen.

585
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Master Dao listens to me.

586
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
Lady Wu Chen was sent by Han Zheng this time.

587
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,860
She's afraid of hurting the students of our school.

588
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
She's against my мояfarmation to take her back to Yuan Zhi.

589
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
She's almost stairs.

590
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,860
Moreover,

591
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,860
Master Shao just gave Master Dao the authority to teach his students.

592
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,060
He just reported the cold.

593
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,300
If he takes her away now,

594
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,700
I'm afraid he will

595
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,660
bring her to Senior Lu

596
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,860
and all the other comrades.

597
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:46,980
So,

598
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,980
please go back to report to the chief.

599
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,180
Just say that Miss Wu Chen reported the cold.

600
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,100
Tomorrow morning,

601
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,900
Mo Xiao will personally take Miss Wu Chen

602
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,180
to the Iron Law School.

603
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,140
And then,

604
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,540
he will go to the building

605
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,540
and continue to think.

606
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,500
So, in order to be safe,

607
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,780
Miss Wu Chen

608
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,500
should stay in the Heaven's Garden.

609
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,380
What should Senior Lu do?

610
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,500
Since he is the chief,

611
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
I have already planned

612
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,260
to report to the chief

613
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,540
to make him rest assured.

614
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,700
Senior Lu,

615
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,940
please sit down.

616
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
But Miss Wu Chen,

617
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,820
if the cold

618
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,460
leaves Mount Shu,

619
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,860
it's impossible to go anywhere.

620
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,380
Miss Wu Chen,

621
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,780
why don't you

622
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,980
take a rest in the room?

623
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,700
Mo Xiao,

624
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,260
I will go to the spiritual hair salon

625
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,340
and stay.

626
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,860
I will leave here

627
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,020
without spiritual hair.

628
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,780
Which of these two results

629
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,980
do you want?

630
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,380
You hurt the disciples

631
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,460
in Mount Shu in the Hall of Heavens

632
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,140
and should be punished.

633
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,340
I understand.

634
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,220
You mean

635
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,380
I should stay?

636
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,940
Okay.

637
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,340
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

638
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,380
You are thinking like this.

639
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,940
I will send you to the Iron Law School tomorrow.

640
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,500
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

641
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,540
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

642
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,740
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

643
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

644
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

645
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

646
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

647
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

648
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

649
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

650
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

651
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

652
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

653
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

654
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

655
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

656
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

657
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

658
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

659
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
I will go to the spiritual hair salon.

660
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
You are here.

661
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
You are here.

662
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Mo Xiao.

663
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,540
Why are you here?

664
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,540
What's wrong with your face?

665
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,340
You've been here all night.

666
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,260
You're not here to find me for the medicine, right?

667
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,580
You have a white grass-based protection method.

668
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,780
What medicine?

669
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,460
I'm here to find you.

670
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,180
Not only for the medicine,

671
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,340
but I also have something to ask you to help me.

672
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,620
What is it?

673
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,860
Here.

674
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,460
The special night I made for you.

675
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,380
You're going to the iron prison tomorrow.

676
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,980
Eat more.

677
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,140
Thank you.

678
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,940
When is it?

679
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,380
You're still interested in reading.

680
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,180
Aren't you worried or afraid at all?

681
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,700
What can I be worried about?

682
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,060
That's the special night I made for you.

683
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,260
Even if there's a person who's good at it,

684
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,420
it's hard to get out of there.

685
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:47,820
You...

686
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,780
Forget it.

687
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,580
You don't have to be afraid.

688
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,500
I've prepared all kinds of pills for you.

689
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,660
I can't die.

690
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,340
Why are you so nice to me?

691
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,300
Don't worry.

692
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,020
I won't let anything happen to me.

693
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,780
Stop saying that, okay?

694
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,140
The young master has caused so much trouble for you.

695
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,420
He's the most important person in the world.

696
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,060
He's been imprisoned by you.

697
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,580
If I were you,

698
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,580
I would have left myself.

699
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,540
I can't do anything about it.

700
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,340
He's my destiny.

701
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,100
I must be with him.

702
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,580
Don't say that.

703
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,220
You should be punished tomorrow.

704
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,140
You want the神 chicken map and the purple beast's belt?

705
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,660
The神 chicken map contains all the punishments of the iron prison.

706
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,020
The purple beast's belt can block the punishment and prevent the people from hurting.

707
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,180
You need to protect these two.

708
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,700
Do you want to turn the iron prison into a prison?

709
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,780
Mo Xiao,

710
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,780
when will you be able to do the same?

711
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,020
Do you have any?

712
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,580
I don't.

713
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,740
These two things are in the神 chicken shop.

714
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,140
They're all in the chicken coffin.

715
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,540
If you want to steal,

716
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,140
you'll have to die in the chicken coffin.

717
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,180
It's not that easy.

718
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,900
There are still the chicken coffin that you don't know about.

719
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,380
That's not true.

720
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,140
But I can't help but steal things from the iron prison.

721
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,180
It's hard to tell.

722
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,620
If that's the case, I'll go and ask for someone else.

723
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,260
I haven't finished my words.

724
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,620
I can't go.

725
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,460
But you're so kind.

726
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,660
You don't have to...

727
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,060
Go to the temple tomorrow to pick a magic trick you like.

728
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,420
Deal.

729
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,620
Master.

730
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,860
Is there any news?

731
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,940
After a number of investigations,

732
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,540
Xue Yao suddenly appeared.

733
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,860
It seems to be related to Mo Xiao.

734
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,540
Where is my daughter, Wu Chen?

735
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,540
I haven't found any information about her.

736
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,700
They picked Xue Yao as a monster.

737
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,860
I'm sure there must be some big moves recently.

738
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,420
You can continue to investigate.

739
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Yes.

740
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Wu Chen, Li Xue.

741
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Is it related to Mo Xiao?

742
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Are you ready?

743
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,180
Yes.

744
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,180
I can go now.

745
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
Me too.

746
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,180
Let's go.

747
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Let's go.

748
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
It seems that I came at the right time.

749
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,180
I said, I want to take her with me.

750
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Master is dead.

751
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
I'll pick up Wu Chen.

752
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Master Shao will go to the Sword Pavilion immediately.

753
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,180
I've given you the purple silk belt.

754
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
Why are you still worried?

755
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
Go to the Sword Pavilion.

756
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
Don't make that old man angry.

757
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,180
He wants me to watch him.

758
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Don't worry.

759
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
You are now the young master of Mount Shu.

760
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,180
You are going to the Iron Pavilion for a girl.

761
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
What's the point of moving?

762
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
Don't worry.

763
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
Ling Yun will accompany you.

764
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
You will be fine.

765
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
Are you going to the punishment?

766
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
You have your fault.

767
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
I have my fault too.

768
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,180
We all have to do the wrong thing for ourselves.

769
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,180
And we are punished.

770
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,180
I'll listen to you.

771
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Let's go.

772
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,180
Wait.

773
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
Be careful.

774
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,180
You also go with her.

775
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,180
If you need anything,

776
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,180
go to the Sword Pavilion to find me.

777
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Yes.

778
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,180
Master Shao.

779
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,180
Moushao,

780
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
I'm sorry.

781
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
Did you want to punishstatic натur kettle to the Ten Devisions Palace?

782
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,060
Here is yourcriptions.

783
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,500
Mo Xiao said you will bring me to Iron Sh mutually.

784
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,820
Why did you come?

785
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,380
Iron Sh tissue was made…

786
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,580
in the Does Talisman Palace…

787
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,100
because it unlocks your form.

788
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,700
Form?

789
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,260
What is the form?

790
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,700
If you confess your también with Mo Xiao's own purpose,

791
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,380
you tell us your true identity.

792
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,340
Perhaps,

793
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,820
I can identify your date.

794
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,220
I've already said it.

795
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,020
I'm the minister of Mount Mang.

796
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,380
Mo Xiao is my mastermind.

797
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,700
I must follow him.

798
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,860
I can't separate with him.

799
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,620
What is my purpose?

800
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,700
You're so ridiculous.

801
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,580
I'm a disciple of Mount Shu.

802
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,420
I'm a god.

803
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,940
Why do you say that?

804
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,860
You've been close to Mo Xiao.

805
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,820
You're so stubborn.

806
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,260
Mo Xiao is a fool to you.

807
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,980
But I've seen your true face.

808
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,580
I've already told you.

809
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,140
Only Mo Xiao can push me away.

810
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,220
You've seen it yourself.

811
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,940
Right?

812
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,140
Why don't you admit it?

813
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,180
Mo Xiao is a good example of my power.

814
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,100
It's not a surprise to push you away.

815
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,380
I won't let you

816
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,540
use your words to insult Mo Xiao.

817
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,340
Use her heart.

818
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,660
Come on.

819
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,700
Send her in.

820
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,340
Yes.

821
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,100
Don't come over.

822
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,140
Let's go.

823
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,260
Why did you let us separate?

824
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,300
Have you heard of the Snow Wind War?

825
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,940
Have you heard of

826
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,940
the name of Feng Li Xue?

827
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,180
What's the name of Feng Li Xue?

828
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,300
What's the name of Feng Li Xue?

829
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,260
Li Xue.

830
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,940
You're Li Xue, right?

831
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,780
Why do we all have the same name?

832
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,500
Miss Wang Shan.

833
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,580
Before you're Wang Shan,

834
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,780
who are you?

835
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
I don't know.

836
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,820
You're still acting?

837
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,820
Fine.

838
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,860
I'll let you do it.

839
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,540
You...

840
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,180
Stop her.

841
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,500
Let go of me.

842
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,700
Don't force me.

843
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,460
Mo Xiao.

844
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,740
Master.

845
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,260
You want to hurt Tong Men?

846
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:19,900
Master.

847
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,900
I took Wu Chen back to Mount Zu.

848
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,300
She's just a orphan.

849
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,740
Why did she do that?

850
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,620
Why should I do that?

851
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,260
You know it very well.

852
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,100
Master.

853
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
Mo Xiao never asked you for anything since he was a kid.

854
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,820
But this time, Mo Xiao asked you

855
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,140
to let Wu Chen go.

856
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,660
Master.

857
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
Master.

858
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,620
Master.

859
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,620
Master.

860
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
Master.

861
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,620
Master.

862
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620
Master.

863
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
Master.

864
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
Master.

865
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,620
Master.

866
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,620
Master.

867
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,620
Master.

868
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Master.

869
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,620
Master.

870
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,620
Master.

871
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,620
Master.

872
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,620
Master.

873
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,620
Master.

874
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Master.

875
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
Master.

876
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,620
Master.

877
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,620
Master.

878
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Master.

879
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,620
Master.

880
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,620
Master.

881
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,620
Master.

882
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Master.

883
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,620
Master.

884
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,620
Master.

885
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,620
Master.
