00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the wind, the moon is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the fog rises

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows and the wind rises

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling water and the water are helpless

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers in the rain

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Like dreams, like you

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, a year, a year, a year

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of the future

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of the future

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There is a lot of rain

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
another life

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,080
You'll also

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Wait for you

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Living with the shaping of the moon

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,360

00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,800

Video produced by Shanfang

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,880
Stitch year

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,840
You live進了一直事,

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,440
the prize 그것,

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,360
is nothing to do with you.

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,000
I ABCchildren in the Article

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
didn't want trust,

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,120
even preparing for that.

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
What are you waiting for?

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,720
I'm out of my mind.

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,880
Stay up to date.

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,480
Fatty,

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,360
let's come and see Sh walks.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,600
OK.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,880
Mo Xiao

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,680
you're thinking really well.

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,440
Are you influencering it?

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,800
It's best to be this way.

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,720
to tell the world that we should open the secret.

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Other people shouldn't have been in jail.

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,320
If you want to

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,360
go to the beach with us,

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
why do you have to

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
offend the people?

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,320
Yes.

61
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,360
Yes.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,560
Yes.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
Yes.

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,520
Where is Wu Chen?

65
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,320
Open the barrier first.

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,720
You will see Wu Chen.

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
Where is he?

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
Mo Xiao.

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,080
You have been fighting for your life.

70
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,400
You even don't know the rules.

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,600
Even if you change the conditions,

72
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,320
you should open the barrier first.

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,880
Whether you let Wu Chen go or not,

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,320
you can do it.

75
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,920
But you...

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,480
Yes. Open the barrier.

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Open the barrier.

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Open the barrier.

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,240
Open the barrier.

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Open the barrier.

81
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,440
Open the barrier.

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,040
Open the barrier.

83
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,120
Open the barrier.

84
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Open the barrier.

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Open the barrier.

86
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Open the barrier.

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Wu Xiao.

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,880
Are you crazy?

89
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,920
I can't give up on Wu Chen.

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,080
No one can leave me today.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
Do you want to leave Shanshan

92
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,520
for Wu Chen?

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,120
I will bear the consequences.

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
What are you talking about?

95
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm afraid you will be implicated.

96
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,880
If you want to save Wu Chen,

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,360
we can think of another way.

98
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,800
But if you do this,

99
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
the news will spread to Shanshan soon.

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,480
I don't know what will happen.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mo Xiao.

102
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
You always stay calm.

103
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,640
What's wrong with you today?

104
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,800
Retreat.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,260
And let me get the money.

106
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,140
Be good.

107
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,400
Go back to Heaven

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,320
and although it's said that the Emperor must have a share of it,

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,800
he Hari In as many people as possible.

110
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Go! Go!

111
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Go! Go!

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Go! Go!

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Go! Go!

114
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
We won't kill you, of course.

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
But if you don't hand over Wu Chen,

116
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
I'll let my Baotar Bell to accompany you here

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
until you hand over Wu Chen.

118
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Master, the Young Master's original intention

119
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
was to fight for the Martial Soul of the Heavenly Formation

120
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
to win the world's first prize.

121
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
But now, the Heavenly Formation is not yet in the world.

122
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
The Young Master's sect has been defeated by all sects.

123
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
It's really a blessing for our Mount Shu.

124
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Senior Brother Zhang Men,

125
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
what Jianchun said makes sense.

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
As the Young Master of Mount Shu,

127
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
his words and actions

128
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
represent our Mount Shu.

129
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
But his current actions

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
are not that effective.

131
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
How can we see the value of our Mount Shu in the future?

132
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
I have to say this.

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
There is indeed a reason for our Mount Shu.

134
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
If it weren't for Feng Yu Sect

135
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
to send back the news,

136
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
we wouldn't know what kind of trouble they would cause.

137
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
It's just that Wan Dao and Bing Hu

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
have different sects in the martial arts world.

139
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Their actions are complicated.

140
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
We can't determine

141
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
the reason for them.

142
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
We shouldn't make any conclusions too early.

143
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Sect Leader.

144
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Sect Leader, Tian Yu and Peng Lai are here to meet.

145
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
What are they doing here at this time?

146
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Please.

147
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Please.

148
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Please.

149
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
My shield.

150
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Watch out.

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Ling Yu.

152
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Thank you for your help.

153
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Mo Xiang, you saw it, right?

154
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
They have all been

155
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
in my hands to make the world a better place.

156
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
And you

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
are still trying to protect the world

158
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
and think that you can save them?

159
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
You took Wu Chen?

160
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
No.

161
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
I'm just saying that

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
they gave Wu Chen to me.

163
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
What do you want?

164
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
You want me to let them go to the clear island?

165
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
And then you want them to watch them fight for treasure

166
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
and open the world?

167
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Where is Wu Chen?

168
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
I don't like to make decisions for others.

169
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
I just like to make choices for them.

170
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
It's your time to make choices.

171
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
When you save Wu Chen,

172
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
you let them go.

173
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
When you save them,

174
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
you let Wu Chen go.

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
You can make a decision

176
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
for Wu Chen and Zhong Sheng.

177
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm the one who will kill you.

178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
You can risk my life.

179
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Wu Chen is so important to you.

180
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Or do you plan to

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
take the risk of

182
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
killing the same person?

183
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
I can prove it to you now.

184
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Since that's the case,

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
then follow me.

186
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Don't come any closer.

187
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Wait for me in the inn.

188
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
What's wrong?

189
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Nothing.

190
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Hello, tier 2 uniform.

191
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
We're here to see you.

192
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Let'sil

193
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Uncle,

194
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
you come here where

195
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
no one else lives?

196
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,480
to take the Heavenly Formation.

197
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
In the world, it's not just the first sect.

198
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,280
It's the Heavenly Formation.

199
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,880
They asked me if I had this incident.

200
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
Has this incident been spread to the Mount Tianyu?

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
It's not just the Mount Tianyu.

202
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,480
Penglai has always been in the Bishu Palace.

203
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,880
He's been rude to the people.

204
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,880
I didn't expect that he was also involved in this.

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,080
He's very popular.

206
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,880
My master also sent me here

207
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,480
to discuss with Shushan.

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
I wonder what kind of statement

209
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
the two masters of the Heavenly Fish and Penglai want.

210
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,880
My master said

211
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,880
we don't want to participate in any of the plans

212
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,280
and we don't want to know.

213
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,880
It's just that before the Bishu Palace,

214
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
it's best to make it clear.

215
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,280
It's said that it's your Shushan's family.

216
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
It's not that we're in the same group as the Immortal Sect.

217
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,680
That kind of Heavenly Formation is not a good idea.

218
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,480
This junior sister is really a fan of Penglai.

219
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,680
But there are some reasons.

220
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,280
Shushan and Penglai are the three great Immortal Sects of the Heavenly Fish.

221
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,080
It's not that Shushan is very famous.

222
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
Of course, we don't need to explain to Shushan.

223
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,080
We're not in the same group.

224
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
If we specifically announce the reason

225
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
to make the matter of the Immortal Sect a mess,

226
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
we won't be in the same group.

227
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Moreover,

228
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,480
the young master ordered us to investigate

229
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,680
the secret of the Heavenly Fish and Penglai

230
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,280
in order to stop the martial law.

231
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,680
As for the young master's personal actions and actions,

232
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,280
what's wrong with it?

233
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,480
We have our own rules and regulations.

234
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,280
As what my junior sister said,

235
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,880
the one who acts

236
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,280
is not equal to Shushan.

237
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,680
Then everyone knows that he is your senior master of Shushan.

238
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,480
Isn't that enough to represent Shushan?

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,880
So you mean to

240
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,280
cancel the name of the master of Mo Xiao's successor?

241
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,680
In this matter,

242
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,280
we should clear the relationship between Shushan and the entire Martial Soul Formation.

243
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,680
If Mo Xiao can't treat this matter well,

244
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I, Shushan, will definitely reconsider the choice of the successor of the master.

245
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,080
What on earth is it that hasn't been given to you yet?

246
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,280
When did you come back?

247
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,480
Computers and a relentless attack

248
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,760
I shouldn't have brought him here.

249
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
What did you say? What happened to the young master?

250
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,880
The young master was taken away by the Fengmian woman to save Wuchen.

251
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,600
Stop.

252
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,960
The young master was taken away by the Fengmian woman.

253
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,160
You're still standing here?

254
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
He told us to wait for him here.

255
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,200
He doesn't want us to risk our lives to save him.

256
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm going to save him.

257
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,760
No.

258
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,360
I'll say it again.

259
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,640
We can't go anywhere if we wait for him here.

260
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,360
It's okay.

261
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,160
Our mission is to protect the young master.

262
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,560
The young master doesn't want to save him.

263
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,840
You can stay here.

264
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,880
We'll go save him.

265
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,160
He's from the previous自願.

266
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,640
Think about it.

267
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,600
With Mo Xiao's body,

268
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
if he wasn't from the previous自願,

269
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
how could he have been taken away by the Fengmian woman?

270
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,600
Since he told us to wait for him here,

271
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,320
he has his own plan.

272
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
If we mess up,

273
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
we'll be in trouble.

274
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,640
Do you understand?

275
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,080
As for the principles,

276
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm still an observer.

277
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,320
I will not hold them back any longer.

278
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not hungry.

279
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,200
Hold your gun.

280
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,760
Hold your gun.

281
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,080
Hold your gun.

282
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,720
Take them back.

283
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,360
Ye Xiao was long away from the throne.

284
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,360
They almost killed him.

285
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't mama it.

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
You care so much about him.

287
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
I don't want to see him.

288
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
But as long as he lets go of him,

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
I'll let you go.

290
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
You risked your life to save him.

291
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Because you think he's innocent?

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,400
Or because he's Feng Linxue?

293
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Mo Xiao,

294
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,000
you've already decided that he's Feng Linxue.

295
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Just curious,

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,800
why Wan Dao Bin Hu Sheng suddenly appeared

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
a girl named Feng Xintian

298
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
and wanted to confirm that

299
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,200
you're wrong.

300
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,000
She's just a pawn.

301
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
And I'm Feng Linxue.

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,600
I remember my hatred and hatred.

303
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
I want to kill her.

304
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
Who is she?

305
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,200
Mo Xiao,

306
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
aren't you smart?

307
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
How can you be so smart?

308
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
You can't even guess it?

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
You're really Feng Linxue.

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,800
How did you live these years?

311
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,800
Live?

312
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
Good question.

313
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
How did I live?

314
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Ten years ago, my father was in the abyss.

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,600
He was in the same hell as me.

316
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,400
No,

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,800
he's even worse than hell.

318
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
He didn't even have a ghost.

319
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,800
I can't have any feelings in my heart.

320
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I only hate him.

321
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Because I can only hate him,

322
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm still alive.

323
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
If you can let Li Xue pay for it,

324
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I'd rather bear all this.

325
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
It's me.

326
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm the one who can't.

327
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm the one who can't.

328
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm the one who can't.

329
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I'm the one who can't.

330
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm the one who can't.

331
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm the one who can't.

332
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
It's me.

333
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
If you can't make it,

334
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
you're a liar.

335
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
If you still have a chance,

336
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
no,

337
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
you have no chance.

338
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Help!

339
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Help!

340
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Help!

341
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Help!

342
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
I can't remember the past.

343
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I can't breathe.

344
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I can't breathe.

345
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
I can't remember the past.

346
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I can't breathe.

347
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
The tree is breaking.

348
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Master,

349
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
the barrier is being set by Mo Xiao.

350
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
He's going to stop everyone from coming in.

351
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
The little bird is trying to stop me.

352
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Master,

353
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
the barrier is being set by Mo Xiao.

354
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm afraid we'll have to get the barrier.

355
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
I'm afraid we'll have to get the barrier.

356
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm afraid we'll have to get the barrier.

357
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Then we'll find Mo Xiao.

358
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
How serious is this wound?

359
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
It's all my fault.

360
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
It's okay.

361
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
This little wound is nothing to me.

362
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
I've always been used to

363
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
loving my father's iron edge.

364
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
But fortunately,

365
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
I helped you to get it.

366
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
If I really got it,

367
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
how will you marry me?

368
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Why?

369
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I wanted it.

370
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
But it teammates with her.

371
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I don't want to ruin it anymore.

372
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
I sent a message to Mo Xiao,

373
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
yet she centro lower me up.

374
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
You said there'll be a barrier for us.

375
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
But you told Nursing Master how to end this barrier.

376
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Can't you put an end to havoc?

377
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
What's the point of it?

378
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Young Master always has his own plan.

379
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
He has his own reason to arrange it.

380
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I think we should not be so reckless.

381
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
But don't you worry about Young Master's situation?

382
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Young Master is a legendary man of Fengyue Sword.

383
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Unless he is willing to,

384
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
who else can touch him?

385
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Look.

386
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Zi Mu is more calm than you.

387
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
How can you let Wu Zhen go?

388
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Don't worry.

389
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I haven't tortured you enough.

390
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
When I am,

391
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I will kill you.

392
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
So,

393
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
do you have the ability

394
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
to talk to me?

395
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
You don't want to kill me.

396
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Tell me.

397
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
If you want to kill me,

398
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
you should have done it.

399
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
What are you waiting for?

400
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
What are you hesitating for?

401
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
You are so confident.

402
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Do you believe me?

403
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I will kill you now.

404
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
You are Feng Nian Ning.

405
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
You released Feng Yuling.

406
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
You want to open the Heavenly Formation.

407
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Who are you?

408
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I am the Star Master of Dark Soul Palace, Ji Xingluo.

409
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Then this is Fengyue Sword Zong.

410
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
You are the disciple of the Star Master.

411
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Luckily, both of you are here.

412
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I will save you.

413
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
You two,

414
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
open the barrier quickly.

415
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Take me to the Heavenly Formation.

416
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Just you?

417
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I want to take you to the Heavenly Formation.

418
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Wu Gong,

419
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
who are you?

420
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
You are the Star Master of Dark Soul Palace.

421
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Sorry for the trouble.

422
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
You and my tent.

423
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Let's make a move.

424
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Let my body free.

425
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,400
It's strange.

426
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,800
Why will there be a unique method?

427
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,640
‫AN. Ziying.

428
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,400

You can go now.

434
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,760
I'll keep you for a few more days.

435
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,960
I'll go there another day.

436
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,360
I'll take you out of here.

437
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
Yun Yun, it's time to take the medicine.

438
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,440
Where is he?

439
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,760
Not good.

440
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,760
What do you think?

441
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,040
him?

442
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,480
Yes.

443
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,040
Yun Yun.

444
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,480
Yun Yun!

445
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,600
Pass her to Yun Yun.

446
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,120
Princess Jiang tochi gives you 60 Content money.

447
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,960
So you need money.

448
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,640
I can suggested them to Yuan Yun.

449
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,160
But it'll cost sufficient.

450
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,520
You said your plan was perfect.

451
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,720
So you recommended them to him.

452
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,840
Singkm guard all the涂 ice.

453
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,880
you, it's bent!

454
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,280
Chang Min, how dare you hit me!

455
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,360
If I didn't use this if I can't use it very smoothly,

456
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,760
you'd want to do it without anycanine, wouldn't you?

457
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,740
Good Master Zhou has not describes himself as one yet,

458
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,140
and will not win any over.

459
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,700
MasterLord has homeland of

Till now, he has plane of

461
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,680
Hope

462
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
I'm not going back.

463
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
The medicine is already cold.

464
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Where is he?

465
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm not going back.

466
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Xie Lianyuan.

467
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Xie Lianyuan.

468
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Xie Lianyuan.

469
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Qing'er.

470
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
What are you doing here?

471
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Why are you here?

472
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
I'm looking for you.

473
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
If you don't come back, the medicine will be cold.

474
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm not going back.

475
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
You found him back?

476
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Such an important magic weapon.

477
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
How can it fall into the water?

478
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
You want pearl?

479
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
That's great.

480
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
I really thought I lost it.

481
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
By the way, are you okay with your wound?

482
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Your wound just got on the medicine and it's water.

483
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Is it really okay?

484
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
You just remembered my wound.

485
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
You fool.

486
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
It's really okay.

487
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
If you don't come back,

488
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
I won't give you the medicine.

489
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Holy Land is so underhanded.

490
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
No use.

491
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
A erwainer.

492
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Take care.

493
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
I'm not gonna be like you anymore.

494
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Have a good rest.

495
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Why don't you go back?

496
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
We are going to fight all day.

497
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
You're overstepping.

498
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
I'm Healthy arbitra.

499
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,680
I said that I would do it if I helped you to open up Tianxi's secret sect.

500
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,680
But I decided to do it myself!

501
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Do you know why I asked you to wear a mask?

502
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Because you can't see the light.

503
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Just finish the plan as soon as possible.

504
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,680
When you have the time to take revenge,

505
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,680
if you dare to do it again,

506
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
I will definitely do it.

507
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
If you dare to do it again,

508
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,680
I will make you lose your mind.

509
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Also,

510
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,680
you can't do it again.

511
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
For me,

512
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
it's more important than you.

513
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
I am the real Song Linxue.

514
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I am the real Song Linxue!

515
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Yes.

516
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Wu Chen.

517
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Wu Chen?

518
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
How could it be him?

519
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Mo Xiao.

520
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Let's go.

521
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Wu Chen, are you okay?

522
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
He is probably just unconscious.

523
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
I opened Tianxi's secret sect

524
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,680
just to take revenge in front of my father.

525
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
As for the treasure in the palace,

526
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,680
we will return to all the world.

527
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,680
If you have the ability,

528
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
take it.

529
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Everyone!

530
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Phoenix-like Heavenly Daughter,

531
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
protect all the beautiful and precious things in the world!

532
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,560
Everyone, get down!

533
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,120
No one is going to stop us today!

534
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,040
I think they're crazy.

535
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,480
We can't stop them.

536
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,080
Go! Go!

537
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,360
We have to wait.

538
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,640
Take care of them.

539
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,720
look at

540
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,880
Hu Chun

541
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,960
She has a壮 norder in her body.

542
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,920
Are you...

543
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,000
Hello?

544
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,280
You are the Miss Division Master?

545
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,480
Are you willing to work inside

546
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,960
and튜 ment?

547
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,680
How are you gonna deal with this?

548
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
Tell me!

549
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,320
Great.

550
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,000
Xin'er!

551
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,560
ahu you're fine.

552
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,040
Xiao'ai,

553
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,040
the treasure box

554
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,080
is inside your box.

555
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,600
How is that possible?

556
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
What kind of demon is this?

557
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
None of your business. Let's go.

558
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Let's go.

559
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
You dare to break into the barrier.

560
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Just take your blood to the Fengyue Realm.

561
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
If the barrier is broken,

562
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
we'll find another chance to go to the island.

563
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Let's go.

564
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Let's go.

565
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Young Master.

566
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
You three go outside and guard.

567
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Yes.

568
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
You're here.

569
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Let's go.

570
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Let's go.

571
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I really need to free myself from the cold air.

572
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Or I'll have to fight against the masters.

573
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Didn't you notice anything strange?

574
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
It's not the first time he's exposed to cold air.

575
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
The cold air can't be removed.

576
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Only the power of the masters can suppress it.

577
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
People who are close to it will be touched.

578
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,680
But the Fengmian女 is fine.

579
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Really?

580
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Is the Fengmian girl so fierce?

581
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
What's more strange is that

582
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
the Fengmian girl's phoenix chain

583
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
didn't hurt Wu Chen.

584
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,680
But Wu Chen's cold air was more serious.

585
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,680
I've never seen the masters be so honest.

586
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Zisu, am I right?

587
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
What's wrong with him?

588
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Why is he so angry recently?

589
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,680
We only stayed at Xuanqing Garden with the masters.

590
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Now that so many things have happened,

591
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
he's not used to it.

592
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
It's good that he's fine.

593
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Master, Ji Xingluo is back.

594
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,680
What's the rule of the Tianmode Sect?

595
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
You have to lock me in the Demon Realm.

596
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I've never seen the rules of the Tianmode Sect.

597
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
But in my place,

598
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,680
you violated my order and it's the rules of the sect.

599
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,680
And it's the rules of the Heaven Realm.

600
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
You're violent and arrogant.

601
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
You're not a member of the Demon Sect.

602
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
You're a man of your word.

603
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Even if you're the late Demon Lord,

604
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
you won't be as good as you are.

605
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,680
The late Demon Lord entrusted the Tianmode Sect to you.

606
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
But you treat the people of the Tianmode Sect like this.

607
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Can you be right?

608
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,680
If I hadn't promised Brother Ye Yuan

609
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,680
not to kill the people of the Tianmode Sect,

610
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,680
do you think you can still live until now?

611
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
You!

612
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
You're a man of your word.

613
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
You're a man of your word.

614
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
You don't listen to me.

615
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
You're not honest.

616
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,680
You said that you should send the Demon Realm to the Demon Realm

617
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,680
and let you reflect on it.

618
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Think about how to make the Dark Soul Star Master of the Tianmode Sect.

619
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Chun Guang,

620
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,680
you've long been looking for the Demon Lord to find the Holy Stone of the Tianmode Sect.

621
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,680
You've also known that the Holy Stone is hidden in the secret treasure of the Heaven Realm.

622
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,680
But you only know half of the fake Star of the Star of the Star of the Star.

623
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,680
Who knows how many evil tricks you've hidden in your back?

624
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
You're so talkative.

625
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Chang Ming, take him down.

626
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Yes.

627
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Take him down.

628
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Look at how beautiful his face is.

629
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
How could he be destroyed like this?

630
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,680
He doesn't know where he's wrong.

631
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,680
I've always been a man of my word.

632
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,680
This is what a beautiful man should look like.

633
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Thank you, Master.

634
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
You're welcome.

635
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Go back to your Dark Soul Palace and wait for your Star Master.

636
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Yes.

637
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
How is it?

638
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Do you two also think that I have any conspiracy?

639
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
The Demon Lord is the Demon Lord of the Tianmode Sect.

640
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,680
The Demon Lord's plan is to make a plan for the Tianmode Sect.

641
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,680
The Demon Lord is the one who entrusted me with the night-time mission.

642
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,680
I'm not from the Tianmode Sect.

643
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:01,680
The Demon Lord is like a sea of ​​a boat.

644
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
So don't worry.

645
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,680
I'll return it to you later.

646
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,680
I'll take you to the Demon Lord's house.

647
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,680
I'll go with you.

648
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
I'll be back.

649
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Thank you.

650
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Thank you.

651
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Thank you.

652
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,680
Thank you.

653
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
I'll go with you.

654
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Thank you.

655
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
Thank you.

656
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Thank you.

657
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
Thank you.

658
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
I'm willing to take the fire.

659
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
You want to come to my Wu Xiang Palace?

660
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
I'm a power-manager.

661
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
I'm not afraid of the purple eagle.

662
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
I also gave the purple eagle a whole heart.

663
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,680
I'm willing to live or die to follow you.

664
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,680
Aren't you afraid that after the purple eagle came out of the Demon Lord's house,

665
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,680
you'll find out that you're the second master and you'll be able to get a gold plating?

666
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm willing to get a gold plating.

667
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
I'm not afraid of the purple eagle.

668
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

669
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Although I hate people who are unruly,

670
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I'm also more familiar with people who are very wise and wise.

671
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Stay here.

672
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

673
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,040
Um..

674
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,640
His action will be worse,

675
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,940
It was just that the copy was still missing,

676
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,420
so I didn't want to make a big mistake.

677
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:25,460
But I just felt so happy by looking at it all these years.

678
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,580
You seem so happy now.

679
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,340
Your Majesty think of me and you to watch me live a curiousood.

680
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,860
You think I want to get angry,

681
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,940
go you help me solve the problem.

682
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,420
Get into your room.

683
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
or not?

684
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Well,

685
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
you stay here.

686
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,640
I'll go out.

687
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,320
Young Master Xie,

688
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,560
where are you going at this time?

689
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,200
What if something happens to the Sect Leader?

690
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
You stay here for three days.

691
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,480
I'll be back

692
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,600
in three days.

693
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,360
Is Wuchen still fine?

694
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,960
Young Master, don't be afraid.

695
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
If the Sect Leader is here,

696
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,040
Miss Wuchen won't

697
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,440
be in the hands of Han Zheng anymore.

698
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm not afraid.

699
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
I'm just...

700
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,840
I'm a little worried.

701
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,360
It's been almost three days.

702
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,360
If we continue like this,

703
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,640
the Sect Leader won't be able to hold on.

704
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,360
No, I have to stop it.

705
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,960
Zi Su,

706
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,880
the Sect Leader is

707
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,080
being burned by Miss Wuchen.

708
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,280
If you break into the room like this,

709
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,440
they'll both be in danger.

710
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
I'm afraid.

711
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
I'm afraid.

712
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
I'm afraid.

713
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm here.

714
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,360
The God of Medicine is not saving me.

715
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
I'm here.

716
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm here.

717
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
I'm here.

718
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm here.

719
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
I'm here.

720
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
I'm here.

721
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,360
I'm here.

722
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
I'm here.

723
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
I'm here.

724
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm here.

725
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,960
I'll cure you.

726
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
What about you?

727
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
Wu Chen.

728
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Save Wu Chen.

729
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,640
In fact,

730
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm not the one who saved you.

731
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,040
What?

732
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,520
I'm not him.

733
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,040
What do you want?

734
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,120
I saved the wrong person.

735
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,920
Of course, I let him

736
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,640
take out the soul-changing pill.

737
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,760
This person is going to save him.

738
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,080
The other one is going to save him too.

739
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,680
No, no, no.

740
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,720
Let's talk about saving one person.

741
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Save one person.

742
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,520
No, no, no.

743
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,320
Two more talks.

744
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,240
Peach Blossom.

745
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,080
Four people.

746
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,800
Four people.

747
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,280
Yes.

748
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,800
Peach Blossom has been saving ten people for three years.

749
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
You don't want to save him?

750
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,560
Save him.

751
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,680
Save people.

752
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,560
Save people.

753
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:11,880
Save...

754
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,800
Ten people.

755
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,960
You're so stubborn.

756
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,280
Where are you?

757
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,080
Look at the color of the face.

758
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
It doesn't look like

759
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,480
a serious internal injury.

760
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,280
Why do you

761
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,560
ask my old man to come here?

762
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,760
That's because my young master

763
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,240
lost half of his internal power

764
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,360
and helped him protect his heart.

765
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,640
Hey, hey.

766
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,320
You're going to ask me to come here.

767
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,080
You're going to save half of it.

768
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,000
Who is the man

769
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
who saved this palace?

770
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,080
No, no, no.

771
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,120
You're so weird.

772
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,440
You saved people.

773
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,840
You save so many people.

774
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,200
Could it be that

775
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,960
you're so stubborn

776
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,080
that you're here to ask for a leave?

777
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,200
Hey, hey, hey.

778
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,480
I'm telling you, you little girl.

779
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,880
It's the first time I've heard

780
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,280
someone feel that I'm not good at art.

781
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,080
Remember.

782
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,600
If you don't keep your life,

783
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,800
I'll definitely be the one

784
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,640
who will help you get back to life.

785
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Pei Pei Pei, you're going to save me?

786
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,800
I don't deserve it.

787
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,440
You...

788
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,120
Stop.

789
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,480
Shen Yi.

790
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,400
An An.

791
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,480
I just helped Wuchen

792
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
to protect his heart.

793
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,240
But he's not good at

794
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,320
art.

795
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,240
He's not good at art.

796
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,760
Thank you.

797
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,360
You see?

798
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,200
He's better than you.

799
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
You're so stubborn.

800
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,520
You deserve it.

801
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,640
Enough.

802
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,600
Shen Yi is sick.

803
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,480
We need to clean up.

804
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,880
You can leave now.

805
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,560
Yes, yes.

806
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,440
Don't stand here.

807
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,280
You can leave now.

808
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,440
Don't disturb others.

809
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,000
Go out.

810
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,080
Yes, baby.

811
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,640
ätzlich.

812
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,480
빼

813
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,260
What're you thinking about telling me?

814
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
