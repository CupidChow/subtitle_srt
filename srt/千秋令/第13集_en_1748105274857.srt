1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind blows warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the fog rises

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows and the river flows

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling water and the water are helpless

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers of life

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
As if in a dream

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As if in you

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The history is not clear

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain of another life

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Episode 1

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 1

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 1

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mo Xiao, that five-tenth wine

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't want it anymore

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Episode 1

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mo Xiao, you have confirmed now

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I will kill you in three days

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
At the moment of my father's death

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will kill you in three days

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hu Fa, what's wrong?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why are there two ladies in this world?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why are there two ladies?

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The lady died and was reborn again

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She is in this world

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Maybe you and I are not clear

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Maybe you and I are not clear

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But what happened?

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What happened?

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You wait here and do your work

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will go to that Wu Chen

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, sir

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why is he still lost?

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So many roads

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Which one to go?

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wu Chen

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You again

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I ask you, do you really remember who you are?

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You came just right

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I really want to ask you

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You already know who I am

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am Feng Lixue

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You know you are Feng Lixue?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am not sure

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But others say I am

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I want to ask you

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you know Feng Lixue

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She is our daughter

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I saw her last time

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She wanted to kill me

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So you think she is real

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I am fake

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I am not sure

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So I need you to prove

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I need you to prove

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are not a guardian of the Tianxin Sect

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You should know Feng Lixue

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know if she is real

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But you can't be Li Xue

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because Li Xue is real

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
She can't be with her enemy

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Enemy? What enemy?

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Kill enemy

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who is the enemy?

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Feng Yue's disciple, Mo Xiao

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He and Feng Lixue

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He killed my father and my master

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And I pushed him to the cliff

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Feng Lixue is real

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
She has a grudge with her father

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She is a traitor

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But you

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You are her benefactor

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are the real Feng Lixue

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who is the real Feng Lixue?

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The grudge of father

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The traitor

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The traitor

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Watch out

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Someone has a branch

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Someone has a branch

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wu Chen

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will make you disappear one day

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What is the truth?

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I will kill you

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I will kill you

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will kill you

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will find it myself

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Young master, you are back

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You and young master went out in the morning

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They didn't let us follow you

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They didn't tell us what to do

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We are worried about you

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They didn't let you follow us

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They just don't want you to know

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a long time

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Young master, please don't blame them

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's okay, what about Wu Chen and Jing?

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They went to the forest to practice

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They should be back

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I am back

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Jing, what happened?

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wu Chen lost it again

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I found it outside

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't find it in many circles

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Mo Xiao, I think he lost it himself

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I should take them to the forest

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No need, I will go

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you looking for me?

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wu Chen, where are you going?

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I have been looking for you for a long time

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I just walked slowly

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Can you not be so worried next time?

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You are so worried

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I am just a girl

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have no relationship with Tong Ming

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I have no relationship with Tianxi

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have no relationship with Tianxi

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What can I worry about?

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right?

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mo Xiao

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Wu Chen, be careful

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's okay

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am a little tired

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I will go back to rest

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you think

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Wu Chen is not as heartless as before?

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He seems to be heartless

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He has experienced so much with us in Fengdu City

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He should have grown up

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
he is still naive and ignorant

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I want revenge

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I want revenge

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let me go revenge

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let me go

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Go back

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Go back

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, I will kill them

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:58,860
BUT, viele others will

162
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,540
?

163
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
But

164
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,640
I can help you.

165
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,240
Allow me.

166
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,540
Fine.

167
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,900
It's an honor for me.

168
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,040
I will release her someday.

169
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
I wish you a happy ending.

170
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,040
From now on, you will never leave.

171
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
You will only have...

172
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,040
a young and innocent daughter.

173
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
You have no memories or resentment.

174
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
You are like a blank paper.

175
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
You just need to wait for it.

176
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,040
I will never leave you.

177
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I will never leave you.

178
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Mo Xiao.

179
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
You are up.

180
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
We are all eating downstairs.

181
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
We haven't seen you for a while.

182
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
I haven't slept well these days.

183
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I just got up late.

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
You are not feeling well recently.

185
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Are you feeling unwell?

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Let me take a look at you.

187
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Is he really my enemy?

188
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Give me your hand.

189
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
How did I use my hand?

190
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
I don't even know.

191
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,040
I will go to see Zisu for some medicine.

192
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
How could this happen?

193
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
The crazy woman...

194
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
appeared on Wu Chen at the same time.

195
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
What is going on?

196
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
It's here.

197
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Go down the stairs.

198
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
The Sect Leader sent someone here.

199
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
You have been working hard all the way.

200
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
How is my father?

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Not bad.

202
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Senior Brother Lu.

203
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I don't know why Senior Brother Lu is here.

204
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,040
The Sect Leader ordered me to send a message to the Sect Leader.

205
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,040
To kill at the Fan complicated rooms.

206
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
hacked into the__

207
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
by Wu Chen at Cang oh,

208
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
he ordered to kill Feng Lixue.

209
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,640
Report to Chief婉 new

210
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
you killed pus Li Xue?

211
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,420
Feng Lixue,

212
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,420
I, Mo Xiao, accept your order.

213
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,220
Senior Brother Lu,

214
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,740
can you only pass the order to Mo Xiao?

215
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,820
I personally ordered to pass it to Mo Xiao.

216
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,020
If so, then the task of killing and choosing Li Xue

217
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,820
can only be done by me, Mo Xiao.

218
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,820
The person who acts on the spot will be punished with the order.

219
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Am I right?

220
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,100
Young Master has particularly emphasized this matter.

221
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,780
I'm afraid that someone will not be able to take the credit with you.

222
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Senior Brother Lu, there are two sides of the matter.

223
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,900
If you take credit, then you will be in trouble.

224
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,700
If you don't act on the spot, then there will be trouble.

225
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,900
At that time, I'm afraid that both of us will not be able to take the risk.

226
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,100
Young Master is very thoughtful.

227
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,900
Senior Brother, I'm just kidding.

228
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,900
But, before the Sect Leader's death, he was particularly cautious.

229
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,300
The Heavenly Formation has been sealed and the seal has been removed.

230
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,900
You must complete the task.

231
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,500
I will wait for the Sect Leader to successfully complete the seal

232
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,100
and return to kill the people.

233
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,700
I will take the decision by myself.

234
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,500
Mo Xiao, what are you going to do?

235
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,300
What do you mean?

236
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,500
The Sect Leader's order is to let you kill Li Xue.

237
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,900
Don't you think it's strange?

238
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,500
The Sect Leader's Uncle has always been a kindhearted person.

239
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,100
Even if he is a demon who has done a lot of evil,

240
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,300
that is also because he is locked up in the iron gate after the suppression.

241
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,900
How could he suddenly let you kill Li Xue?

242
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,300
What's even more strange is that he actually said that

243
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,500
Wu Chen and the Phoenix Girl are both Li Xue.

244
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,700
You should figure out who they are.

245
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,100
What's most strange is that you actually accepted the Sect Leader's order

246
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,300
and said that you would kill Li Xue by yourself.

247
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,700
I'm now concerned about who you are going to kill.

248
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,300
You won't kill both of them, right?

249
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
I think Wu Chen is really not like him.

250
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,100
Look at him.

251
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Did I do something wrong?

252
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,700
Wu Chen is Wu Chen.

253
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
That's good.

254
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
I just said that Wu Chen is so naive and shameless.

255
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,700
How could it be that he is the Phoenix Girl?

256
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
He even has a white-hearted heart.

257
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,200
But, by the way,

258
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,100
without your expression and your ugly and impulsive behavior,

259
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,400
can you change it?

260
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,300
Otherwise, as your brother, you would be really tired.

261
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,900
You are wasting your brain.

262
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,100
They are obviously two people.

263
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,480
Wu Chen,

264
00:15:42,580 --> 00:16:02,600
make do with these two people,

265
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,400
Does he look like the Wu Chen in Mount Wang?

266
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,440
He's ignorant and ignorant.

267
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,920
There's nothing different between him and the dead.

268
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,400
Wu Chen.

269
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Wu Chen, what's wrong?

270
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,440
What's wrong?

271
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,400
Or if you have any feelings,

272
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,320
you can tell me if you have any feelings.

273
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
Xie Lin Yun said,

274
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
if you have any feelings,

275
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,600
and you want to tell the person,

276
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,480
then the person must be the most trusted and liked person.

277
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,120
Mu Xiao,

278
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,200
do you want to be the person I trust the most?

279
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,840
But everyone

280
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,960
is also talking about Xie Lin Yun's life for me.

281
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
I,...

282
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,560
do.

283
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,540
I do.

284
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,880
Master.

285
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
The Prime Minister has given you a order

286
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,080
to kill a phoenix in Mu Xiaoshopeng.

287
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm afraid of the mountain.

288
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Master, are you worried?

289
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Mo Xiao won't kill her.

290
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,080
Whether it's Wuchen or Feng Mian Yu,

291
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,480
she will lead Mo Xiao to the capital.

292
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,680
And she has no choice.

293
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,880
If you want to know the truth, you must go to the heaven to hide.

294
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,080
I'm afraid of the mountain.

295
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Master, are you worried?

296
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,280
If you want to know the truth, you must go to the heaven to hide.

297
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
When she understands everything,

298
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
it's already too late.

299
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
It's all because of this Feng Mian Yu.

300
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,680
If it wasn't for her, she wouldn't have caused trouble for Wuchen.

301
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,880
Master, do you want to keep her out of this?

302
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,680
No need.

303
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,680
Wuchen will wake up sooner or later.

304
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,280
When she understands everything,

305
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,680
Feng Mian Yu will disappear naturally.

306
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,680
I'm going to the capital to meet my beloved.

307
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm going to the capital to meet my beloved.

308
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,280
I'm going to the capital to meet my beloved.

309
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,480
The flowers and snow in the dream are falling.

310
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,880
The wind and rain in the sky are covered in your eyes.

311
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,680
The wind and rain in the night are covered in your eyes.

312
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
The heart is tired.

313
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,280
I'm going to the capital to meet my beloved.

314
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,280
I'm going to the capital to meet my beloved.

315
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,080
I'm going to the capital to meet my beloved.

316
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,880
The road to the end of the world is a journey of stars and stars.

317
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,080
The night passes by and the night is gone.

318
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
The real Feng Mian Yu

319
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
is in the hands of her beloved.

320
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,480
She is in the hands of her beloved.

321
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Mu Xiao, is this really true?

322
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,680
What is your relationship with her?

323
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,680
What is your relationship with her?

324
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,180
Createjaz Mc практи

325
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,620
The st За같y Tsubashi.....

326
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,620
The Phoenix Girl promised to take us to the island.

327
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
She won't let anyone else come in.

328
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Why did the Immortal Island come to the island and not see the Phoenix Girl?

329
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Maybe the Phoenix Girl just wants to prove to everyone that

330
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
her words are true.

331
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
Du Feng is right.

332
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Feng Xing Tian is in the Immortal Island to build a heavenly tomb.

333
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
He will set up a wide range of concerns.

334
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
That's why the world is in a difficult situation.

335
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,620
If the Phoenix Girl hadn't opened up, you and I would have been in trouble.

336
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
We would have been forced to do so.

337
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,620
It's just that we are just giving up our lives.

338
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
Tian Wen Shu killed a young master.

339
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,620
She wants to kill Feng Xing Tian.

340
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Is that why the Phoenix Girl didn't show up?

341
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,620
What if the Phoenix Girl is really killed?

342
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,620
If Tian Xing is killed, she will become a rebel again.

343
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,620
We must find the Phoenix Girl as soon as possible.

344
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,620
Young Master, the Immortal Island has appeared.

345
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,620
It seems that the Phoenix Girl really wants to open up Tian Xing's secret treasure.

346
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
Now, the people are all in the public.

347
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,620
They are all going to the sea to the Moon and the Moon Precepts.

348
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,620
However, the public is out of the island and there are many people.

349
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,620
The people who are trying to get the Immortal Island are all going to the wrong place.

350
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
It's good that there are these people with the arrows of the front car.

351
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,620
The rest of them won't be busy getting the Immortal Island.

352
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,620
Mo Xiao, what should we do now?

353
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
Young Master!

354
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,620
Do you know what happened to the Immortal Island?

355
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
What's the meaning of this crime, Senior Brother?

356
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
The Phoenix Girl is going to open up Tian Xing's secret treasure.

357
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,620
Since Young Master has already received the order,

358
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,620
before she opens up Tian Xing's secret treasure and kills her,

359
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,620
she can stop a martial art martial art martial art.

360
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
Thank you for your reminder, Senior Brother Lu.

361
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
I don't know what you have planned.

362
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,620
If you need my help, please let me know.

363
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
If you have received the order to kill me,

364
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,620
then the one who killed the Phoenix Girl is Mo Xiao.

365
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,620
I won't bother you anymore.

366
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,620
If you are fine, please go back.

367
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,620
How is it? Did the Immortal Island really appear?

368
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,620
Have you ever seen the Phoenix Girl?

369
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Mo Xiao, I think we should still

370
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,620
discuss the matter with the Immortal Island.

371
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,620
After all, you have received the order of the Sect Leader.

372
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,620
At that time, you are going to take the Phoenix Girl and return it to the Sect Leader.

373
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
We can only wait for now.

374
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
Wait?

375
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,620
Are we going to wait for it to appear like this?

376
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
That's right. Wait.

377
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,620
Are they both in the shoes?

378
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Shouldn't they stop the Phoenix Girl from starting Tian Xing's secret treasure?

379
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,620
How could Mo Xiao still be so calm and sit in the room?

380
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,620
That's right.

381
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,620
The Immortal Island has already appeared.

382
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Once the Phoenix Girl appears,

383
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,620
all the sects in the Ice Lake will surely be blown up like a wind.

384
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,620
At that time, we don't know how many people will die.

385
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
Don't worry.

386
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Mo Xiao will definitely not let this happen.

387
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
But he didn't do anything.

388
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
How will he stop it?

389
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,620
Also, what about the Sect Leader's order?

390
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,620
Senior Brother Lu has forced Brother Mo Xiao to kill the Phoenix Girl.

391
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,620
What plan does Brother Mo Xiao have now?

392
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
I won't wait anymore.

393
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
You three wait for Mo Xiao's decision.

394
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,620
Jing'er, go to the canyon with me and see the cave entrance.

395
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,620
Okay.

396
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
Zi Su?

397
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,620
I was about to look for you.

398
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
I want to buy a peony rice ball.

399
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Let's go together.

400
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Okay.

401
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,620
I was just about to ask if you wanted to eat something.

402
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,620
Let's go together.

403
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,620
Too many people are not allowed to use it.

404
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
I was about to ask if you wanted to eat something.

405
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Let's go together then.

406
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
Too many people are not allowed to use it.

407
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,620
You want to kill me for Mo Xiao?

408
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,620
You already know who I am.

409
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,620
You hid a good identity.

410
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,620
You made the Sect Leader confused and made him not bear to let you do anything.

411
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,620
You made him become the first and last disciple of the Sect Leader's order.

412
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,620
You wanted to make him angry, but I was there to make you feel ashamed.

413
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,620
You are so loyal to Mo Xiao.

414
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,620
You are so loyal to Mo Xiao.

415
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,620
You are so loyal to Mo Xiao.

416
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
You are so loyal to Mo Xiao.

417
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
I am happy for her.

418
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,620
I know you wanted to kill me for a long time.

419
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I should give you this chance.

420
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,620
You already know why you still want to make the Sect Leader confused and make him bear to let you do anything.

421
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
I am not mean.

422
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,620
I just don't know if I am Feng Mingxuan.

423
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,620
So I won't wait any longer.

424
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,620
I will make it clear to you.

425
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,620
You want to leave?

426
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Help me make a farewell.

427
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,620
Come out.

428
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
You don't have to follow me.

429
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,620
I want to know more about the truth than you.

430
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Instead of making a guess here,

431
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,620
why don't you tell Feng Ming that I am going to make a clear answer?

432
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,620
What do you mean?

433
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,620
Only by entering the real Sky-wrapped Cicada can you answer the question.

434
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,620
Only the real snow can be solved by the Sky-wrapped Cicada.

435
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,620
But this is indeed the best way.

436
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,620
But he can't agree.

437
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,620
He wants to kill Mo Xiao.

438
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Then tell him that I am going to make it.

439
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
Mo Xiao will definitely go.

440
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,620
Okay. I will tell him now.

441
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,620
We can leave now.

442
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
The Wind-Wrapped Girl has made it to the Sky-wrapped Cicada.

443
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
The Sky-wrapped Cicada is about to start.

444
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,620
You inform the others.

445
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Yes.

446
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,620
I will tell them.

447
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
I will tell them.

448
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,620
I will tell them.

449
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,620
I will tell them.

450
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,620
I will tell them.

451
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,620
I will tell them.

452
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
I will tell them.

453
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
I will tell them.

454
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
I will tell them.

455
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
I will tell them.

456
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
I will tell them.

457
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
I will tell them.

458
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
I will tell them.

459
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
I will tell them.

460
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
I will tell them.

461
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,620
I will tell them.

462
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
I will tell them.

463
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,620
I will tell them.

464
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,620
I will tell them.

465
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,620
I will tell them.

466
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,620
I will tell them.

467
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,620
I will tell them.

468
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
I will tell them.

469
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,620
I will tell them.

470
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
I will tell them.

471
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,620
I will tell them.

472
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,620
I will tell them.

473
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,620
I will tell them.

474
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I found it.

475
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
It's a separate tree.

476
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
It's a part of the glass.

477
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,620
It's on different bodies.

478
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,620
I understand.

479
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,620
I want to see the young master.

480
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
The young master told me that no one is here today.

481
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
Does he know that the Taoism Taoism has appeared?

482
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
The Phoenix Mask Girl can open the Sky-wrapped Cicada at any time.

483
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,620
No matter how hard she tries, she can't do anything.

484
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,620
She won't see me at this time.

485
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Shouldn't she give me a way?

486
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,620
The young master told me that no one is here today.

487
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,620
The young master is not in action.

488
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,620
Why don't you tell master about it?

489
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,620
I think this is our chance.

490
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,620
What do you mean?

491
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
The young master is not in action.

492
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
He has no right to do anything.

493
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
If the young master can catch the Phoenix Mask Girl before the young master,

494
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
then he won't let her go back to the place

495
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,620
before the Taoism Taoism.

496
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,620
We can catch the Phoenix Mask Girl.

497
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,620
Then the young master...

498
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Since Mo Xiao is not in action,

499
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
I can't do anything.

500
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,620
I can't protect the current situation.

501
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,620
You can't do anything.

502
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Exactly.

503
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,620
But we need to find someone to help us build this.

504
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
What you mean is...

505
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,620
I heard that the Moon-wrapped Cicada in Wan Dao Ice Lake

506
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
is the place where the ancient god of Water-Current, Water-Current,

507
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
was built by Penglai.

508
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,620
The main disciple of Water-Current is the Emperor of Penglai.

509
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
The young master is just in a state of state.

510
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,620
He is still in a relationship with me.

511
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,620
If I ask him to help me catch the Phoenix Mask Girl,

512
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
he will definitely not give up.

513
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,620
If the Emperor of Penglai comes to build this,

514
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
then it won't be easy.

515
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
Of course.

516
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,620
Disciple.

517
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,620
Disciple, what were you completely doing here?!

518
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
What about the Young Master?

519
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,620
Where is he?

520
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Where is he?

521
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Disciple, the Young Master said that he didn't meet anyone.

522
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,620
I saw tonight's field colour and remove the mauve rays.

523
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,620
We need to improve the spirit power toaret.

524
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,620
Young Master went to see the energy apple.

525
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,620
It is the most dominant thing,

526
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,620
but I miss it very much.

527
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,620
I always think we can think of a way.

528
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,620
We can choose for it.

529
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
We can choose for it.

530
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,620
But the current outside is not the Enchi stones,

531
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
they're the Дsl ones.

532
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
The Immortal Sect has used this technique.

533
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,940
Demon Lord.

534
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,180
The Wind-faced Woman.

535
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,940
Brother Li.

536
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,020
Sect Leader.

537
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,540
I...

538
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,540
Sect Leader.

539
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,580
I'm missing.

540
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,380
What?

541
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,140
I think the Wind-faced Woman has taken her away.

542
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,660
Sect Leader.

543
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,380
Sect Leader.

544
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,460
Please tell me the truth.

545
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,740
The Wind-faced Woman has been discovered.

546
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
The Wind-faced Woman

547
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,460
Don't be afraid.

548
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,460
I'm here.

549
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,780
I'm not afraid.

550
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,260
If you're caught by a few evil demons,

551
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,980
what do you want to do?

552
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,300
Good point.

553
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,420
I like the way you are.

554
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,900
You're so handsome.

555
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,700
Mo Xiao.

556
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,380
Brother Mo Xiao.

557
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,420
You're finally here.

558
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,060
Where's Wu Chen?

559
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,420
Now, Wu Xia is the one.

560
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,820
I need to go to the clear island

561
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,740
and find the Wind-faced Snow.

562
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,100
Mo Xiao.

563
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,140
Don't talk.

564
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,500
Mo Xiao.

565
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,060
You've made it clear.

566
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,700
Who is the Wind-faced Snow?

567
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
Wu Chen and the Wind-faced Woman

568
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,260
might be the Wind-faced Snow.

569
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,260
They are.

570
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,900
How is that possible?

571
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
As for the Wind-faced Snow,

572
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,020
why did it turn into two different real-life characters?

573
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,620
Is there anyone else behind it

574
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
who doesn't know about it?

575
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,540
Now, the one who wants to know

576
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,020
is me, the island,

577
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,340
who wants to find them and stop them.

578
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,100
Wu Chen and the Wind-faced Snow

579
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,780
might have been in the island.

580
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,420
You must keep it well.

581
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,860
Don't let anyone get in.

582
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,660
Don't worry.

583
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:07,980
Yes.

584
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,020
Leave it to me.

585
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,220
You can go safely.

586
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,660
Jing'er.

587
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,140
The Three Roots House

588
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,740
is located in Mount Shu.

589
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,460
Yes.

590
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,460
It's where we...

591
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,340
We're located on Mount Shao.

592
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,540
bicipsic water and hundreds of accenturions

593
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,920
Gеди Gwatch.

594
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,260
That's right

595
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:50,060
Fellas of the Mount

596
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,480
First Lady weit

597
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,000
De大

598
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,720
Why did Mo Xiao die alone?

599
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,920
The young master ordered the young master

600
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,440
to capture Feng Lixue.

601
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,240
Now Feng Lixue is on the board.

602
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,880
The young master is going to capture him.

603
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,600
Do you need to agree?

604
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,320
Since the disciples of Mount Zu have arrived,

605
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,320
we will also have to go.

606
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,520
Unreasonable.

607
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,680
I'll go to the prison.

608
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,280
Go.

609
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,200
Go.

610
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,160
Keep the prison.

611
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Go.

612
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,840
Master.

613
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,480
Is there any news from the Tongming Island?

614
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,720
Wu Chen and Feng Mianyu have been hurt.

615
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,000
Where is Mo Xiao?

616
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,840
He just went in with me.

617
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,320
Okay.

618
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,120
You go prepare.

619
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,320
We should also go.

620
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,760
Come.

621
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,320
This way.

622
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,360
Miss.

623
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,120
We are on the Tongming Island now.

624
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,280
Did you hear something strange?

625
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,640
Miss, don't panic.

626
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,600
This is the sound of the rock under the island.

627
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,960
Hearing this sound,

628
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,680
it means the rock is asleep.

629
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,680
Then we will open the heavenly treasure.

630
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,120
Will it wake up?

631
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,440
If Miss opens the mechanism and enters the treasure,

632
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,000
the rock should not wake up.

633
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,000
Then...

634
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
So what if it wakes up?

635
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,200
The Tongming Island is in lyrical condition.

636
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,440
Systema leaves its tail.

637
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,040
If the chemical pouvaitation is on atmosphere and expression,

638
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,720
then probably the Tongming Island

639
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:14,100
will do as water該

640
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,500
Do you know that Snow of the Day is attracting your attention?

641
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,180
That's true.

642
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,580
The leader's position is so部分less.

643
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,500
That's it.

644
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,960
The feet...

645
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,160
You've had a long walk to the mountain,

646
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,120
how are you now?

647
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,700
Baroness Great you are so pretty this ability,

648
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,360
why are you still here?

649
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,220
Actually, you look different that you close.

650
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Miss, hold on.

651
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,220
Hold on, Miss.

652
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,720
What are you doing?

653
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,220
Miss, don't you remember?

654
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,220
When you were young, you liked to go to the mountains.

655
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,220
You were in a state of anger and you couldn't carry you.

656
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,720
So you always took a cloth and held on to it to climb the mountain together.

657
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
I don't remember.

658
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
That's right.

659
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
You've grown up.

660
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,220
You're still young.

661
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,220
You've grown up.

662
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
You've been dressed up for Qi Han.

663
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
You won't need this anymore.

664
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
Give it to me.

665
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,220
Let's go.

666
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,220
Miss.

667
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
It's nothing.

668
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Don't worry. Let's go.

669
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,220
Okay.

670
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,220
Come.

671
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,220
Let's go.

672
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,220
Master, Mo Xiao is on the island now.

673
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Will he stop Wu Chen from opening the Sky-like Secret Pavilion?

674
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,220
He stopped the day at Peach Blossom House.

675
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:45,220
Today, he left the disciple of Mount Zu and followed Wu Chen.

676
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,220
He must have prepared to open the Sky-like Secret Pavilion.

677
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,220
After all, the truth he wanted to know is right there.

678
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,220
But we haven't found the entrance to the Sky-like Secret Pavilion yet.

679
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
Don't worry.

680
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Li Xue is the daughter of the Sky-like Phoenix.

681
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,220
She will be the one to open the Sky-like Secret Pavilion.

682
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
Give her some more time.

683
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,220
Yes.

684
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
What's wrong?

685
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,220
I remember that Master went with her.

686
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,220
After passing through the forest, there was a cliff.

687
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220
The entrance to the Sky-like Secret Pavilion was on the cliff.

688
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,220
But why isn't it here?

689
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Did you remember it wrong?

690
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
He remembers it wrongly.

691
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,220
The entrance to the Sky-like Secret Pavilion was originally here.

692
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,220
But it's clear that the years have passed.

693
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,220
The entrance to the Sky-like Secret Pavilion has been changed.

694
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,220
Then we can't enter the Sky-like Secret Pavilion?

695
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Of course we have to.

696
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,220
I still have to use Mo Xiao's blood to remember the father's spirit.

697
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,220
I will prove my strength and your incompetence.

698
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,220
I will make you disappear from this world without a trace.

699
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,220
I'm the only one in this world who can make a difference.

700
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,220
How do you know that I'm the one who disappeared, not you?

701
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,220
You also don't know who is the real Snow-like Phoenix, right?

702
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Only the real Snow-like Phoenix can open the Sky-like Secret Pavilion.

703
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,220
That's why you asked Po Yun to take me to the Pavilion, right?

704
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,220
I asked you to go to the Pavilion to make a difference.

705
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,220
But I'll kill you now!

706
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Mo Xiao?

707
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Don't hurt her.

708
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Fine. I'll do whatever you want.

709
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,220
I don't mind if I can't solve you now!

710
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,220
Po Yun!

711
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Mo Xun!

712
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,220
Be careful, Mo Xun!

713
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,220
Hurry up!

714
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,220
Wu Chen, you shouldn't have gone to the Pavilion.

715
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,220
Actually, you already decided that I'm the Snow-like Phoenix, right?

716
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,220
You just don't understand.

717
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,220
What does it have to do with me and the Phoenix-like woman?

718
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,220
I want to know more about the truth than you do.

719
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,220
Now, I can only open the Sky-like Secret Pavilion.

720
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,220
I said that I'll find out the truth about the truth.

721
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,220
Whether you're the Snow-like Phoenix or Wu Chen,

722
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,220
it doesn't matter to me.

723
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,220
I just hope that you won't fall into the Demon Realm because of hatred.

724
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,220
Demon Realm?

725
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,220
You and the Phoenix-like woman are all because of the Snow-like Phoenix.

726
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,220
There's only one reason.

727
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,220
That is, someone added a soul-like spirit to the Snow-like Phoenix.

728
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,220
It's the spirit of the Snow-like Phoenix, and it's a second soul.

729
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,220
That is to say, you and the Phoenix-like woman are both the spirit of the original spirit.

730
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,220
And one is the Su-like spirit.

731
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,220
If you want to break the spirit of the Soul-like Spirit,
