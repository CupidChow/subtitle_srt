1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Always

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows, the fog blows, the waves blow, the wind blows, the river flows

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The falling flowers blow, the water flows, the shadow flows

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The flowers in the water, like dreams, like you

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no breath, no breath

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The tears are not clear

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Another life, the rain, the light, the snow, wait for you

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Wait for you

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 18

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You have been a hero for 18 years

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You seem to be ungrateful

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are looking for someone secretly

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Right?

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You know?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course I know

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You want to borrow the magic power of the Holy Stone

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
To find your own son

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My son is the real Ye Yuan Xue Man

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He is the real master of Su Yushan and the Holy Stone

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But you are just a little man in the imperial army

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What a pity

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You have been looking for him for 18 years

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But you never found him

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can you tell me why you can't hold on to him

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And you don't care about others?

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's Mo Xiao

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tell me

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I thought you used Feng Yu Xue to control Mo Xiao

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
To take advantage of his power of the Holy Stone

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
To make Wu Yan's life easier

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But then I found out I was wrong

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You let Mo Xiao into the game

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Not only because he is the legendary of the Holy Stone

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He broke into my home

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But he was able to set up a barrier in my home

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He went into the Heavenly Demon Garden

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But he could still return to his body

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But he was so stubborn to him

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But because he had another secret in his body

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You think it's a secret?

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But because

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Holy Stone of the Third Seventh Seventh is in Mo Xiao's hands

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Continue

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If it wasn't for the Holy Stone of the Third Seventh Seventh

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
To be taken by Mo Xiao

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Then why did he break into my home

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But he was so stubborn

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He was so stubborn

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He was so stubborn

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But he was so stubborn

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Your analysis is not reasonable

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you weren't the Holy Stone of the Third Seventh Seventh

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
To be taken by Mo Xiao

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then why did Mo Xiao and Shushan

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Release me from the Holy Stone of the Third Seventh

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And break into my home

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But you never let him go to the dead

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You never let him go to the dead

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You never let him go to the dead

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You never let him go to the dead

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You never let him go to the dead

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I know

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are blaming me

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why didn't you avenge Ye Yuan?

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I want to give you a word

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
To achieve great things

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You have to be patient

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
One day I will show you

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How I avenged Ye Yuan

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How I found his blood

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
For the Holy Stone of the Third Seventh Seventh

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
To break into a empty world

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I won't be in Suyushan

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will be in the hands of the King

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You will lose a lot

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You won't know the whereabouts of Ye Yuan's blood

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You really know it, right?

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then tell me where he is

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Tell me

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Tell me

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Tell me

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Where is he?

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Tell me

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Tell me

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Tell me

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I never thought about the stone

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I never thought about the Holy Stone

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I just want to find my son

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I never thought about his blood

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I never thought about his blood

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Send the Holy Master Xu Yuan back to the palace

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will take the Holy Master Xu Yuan back to the palace

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Take the Holy Master Xu Yuan back to the palace

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Master

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Tell me

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will beg you

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Master

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Master

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Master

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Master

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you sleepy?

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm drunk

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mo Xiao

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Have you ever thought about

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you are not in Suyushan

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But a normal child

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What will you look like?

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What will happen to the normal child?

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You are born with a good temper

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are smart

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
When you were just five years old

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Someone came to your house

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
To marry you

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are a little girl with a sharp tongue

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are a beautiful girl

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
with a beautiful face

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That time was your wedding

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Then you were beautiful

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like a dream

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
A good girl

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You are a good girl

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are a good girl

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Your Highness

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
After I complete the mission

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will take you to the mountains

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I will follow you to the forest

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will take care of you

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't want to talk about you

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I just want to talk about you now

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,520
I want to

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
angan

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I want to say that

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Jin families

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,180
On

157
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:58,300
July

158
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
I don't think so.

159
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,300
But I can see

160
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,500
that Brother Mo Xiao

161
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,100
hopes he is just an innocent person.

162
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,500
He will always be.

163
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,700
I guess when Mo Xiao

164
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,500
took him from Mount Mang,

165
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,500
he knew he was Lin Xuan.

166
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
He was really a traitor

167
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,300
who was destined to be in the past.

168
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
I don't know

169
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,700
what's wrong with him.

170
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,900
By the way,

171
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,500
did you use

172
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
the news of the Mo Xiao in the treasure chest?

173
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
He asked you to help the soldiers.

174
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
I've checked it out.

175
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,500
The soldiers are looking for the treasure chest.

176
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
It's weird.

177
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
How come my treasure chest

178
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,300
can't find Brother Mo Xiao's Lin Xi?

179
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
I guess

180
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,100
he must be hiding somewhere

181
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,900
with Li Xue.

182
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
If the soldiers want to find the treasure chest,

183
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,100
he will cover his own Lin Xi.

184
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
My treasure chest

185
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,700
is very normal to find the good old man.

186
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,900
Makes sense.

187
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,300
As long as they go down the mountain,

188
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
they can't be satisfied

189
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,900
with the number of soldiers

190
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
who stole the Tian Mo Sect.

191
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
They can't be satisfied with them.

192
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,500
Oh, no.

193
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,500
Your father's treasure chest

194
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,900
is not better than yours.

195
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,900
If he finds the Mo Xiao first,

196
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
our lies will be ruined.

197
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,700
Don't underestimate my treasure chest.

198
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,500
My treasure chest can't find anything.

199
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,100
My father can't find anything.

200
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,900
Great.

201
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,300
The treasure chest is the best.

202
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,700
No.

203
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,100
We are in the top.

204
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,300
The best.

205
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,900
Alright.

206
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,900
Now,

207
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
we should think about

208
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,100
how to play this game.

209
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
What game?

210
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,300
People will come to us

211
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,500
if we get hurt.

212
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,100
We can't

213
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,500
get over it.

214
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,500
So,

215
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
we should act out a good game.

216
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,100
Then,

217
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,500
what should we do?

218
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Wu Fu.

219
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,900
Here.

220
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Don't bite.

221
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,500
Don't bite.

222
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,100
How is it?

223
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,700
This is the best wine in Peach Blossom House.

224
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Is it enough?

225
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,700
Yes.

226
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Absolutely.

227
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,500
Boy,

228
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
I have to tell you clearly.

229
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,100
I made a deal

230
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,300
with the two of us

231
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
to make a deal.

232
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,900
I don't want to say that

233
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,900
because I want to drink your good wine.

234
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,900
Of course.

235
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,500
You are here to make a deal with us.

236
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,700
As a partner,

237
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,700
I want to give you the best wine.

238
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,500
Yes.

239
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,100
Unlike some people,

240
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,300
young and immature,

241
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
they don't speak.

242
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,900
Let's not be a commoner.

243
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,900
Yes.

244
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
You are right.

245
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,100
I don't have the leisure

246
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
to be a commoner.

247
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,700
What's wrong?

248
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,700
Did something happen?

249
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,500
Lu Jianchuan came to Peach Blossom House.

250
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,300
Good.

251
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,300
Since you are here,

252
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,100
let's play a game.

253
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,300
Why are you laughing?

254
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,100
Come back.

255
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Hurry up.

256
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,500
I think

257
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,300
you are already a star.

258
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,900
If you don't cooperate with us,

259
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,700
we will be in trouble.

260
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,500
How can you say that?

261
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,300
I'm afraid his father is here.

262
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,700
He doesn't know him.

263
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,300
You must not know him.

264
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,300
You are late.

265
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,300
You are late.

266
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I'm late.

267
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,900
I'm coming.

268
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,300
Thank you for your kindness.

269
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,700
I will take you to the school.

270
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,300
I will take you to the school.

271
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,700
I will take you to the school.

272
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,700
Thank you.

273
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,500
Who is this?

274
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Can you represent the disciples

275
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,300
of the chief of the Shushan Sect?

276
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,500
I think he is the best person in Shushan.

277
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,100
This is the disciple of Shushan Sect.

278
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,300
Lu Jianchuan and Lu Senior.

279
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,500
So he is the disciple of Shushan Sect.

280
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,300
Excuse me.

281
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,100
Thank you.

282
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
How is the injury of the chief?

283
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,300
It's the injury of the chief.

284
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,300
It's hard to say.

285
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,100
If the money is worth the money,

286
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
maybe it can be recovered in seven days.

287
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,300
If the money is worth the money,

288
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm afraid he will be ill for nine days.

289
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,900
I'm afraid.

290
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,900
What do you need?

291
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
The Shushan Sect is full of grass.

292
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,100
It's very rare.

293
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,900
You mean

294
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,100
you don't believe my old man's medical skills?

295
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,700
Fine.

296
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,700
I will take you to the Shushan Sect.

297
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,300
Take him away.

298
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,500
Don't be angry, Shiyi.

299
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Senior Lu is just worried about the illness of the chief.

300
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,700
Yes, Shiyi.

301
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,900
My purpose is to visit the chief's wounds.

302
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
If I don't ask him,

303
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,900
I can't go back to Shushan to pay my life.

304
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,700
So you mean

305
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,300
if I tell him clearly,

306
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,300
you can understand?

307
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,900
Shiyi.

308
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,700
How about

309
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
I let you have a look?

310
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,700
Just one look.

311
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,700
You can go back to pay your life.

312
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,700
Yes.

313
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,100
Then

314
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,300
I can only have one look.

315
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,300
If I tell you clearly,

316
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,900
don't open the window.

317
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,700
Or else,

318
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
you chiefs

319
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,700
will be in my old man's hands.

320
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,900
Of course.

321
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,900
If you are so secretive,

322
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,500
you still have the magic trick.

323
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,900
Senior Lu, now you know.

324
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,300
Why doesn't Shiyi

325
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
get close to the person?

326
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,900
Understand.

327
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,700
Understand.

328
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,500
Shiyi.

329
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Jianchuan met Shiyi.

330
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,900
Shiyi,

331
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,100
I thought Mo Xiao is so serious.

332
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,100
No wonder

333
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,100
he didn't come to Ningzhi.

334
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,500
Shiyi is in a hurry

335
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,300
to see Shiyi again.

336
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,900
Thank you, Shiyi.

337
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,100
Don't be so stubborn.

338
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm here to save him.

339
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,500
Shiyi is in a hurry to help him.

340
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,300
It's none of your business.

341
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,500
Shiyi,

342
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,500
Jianchuan has a favor to ask.

343
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,300
A favor?

344
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,500
What favor?

345
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
I'm an old man.

346
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,700
I know some magic tricks.

347
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,700
If you want to find a doctor,

348
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,500
I'll have to see how my old man is doing.

349
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,300
Okay.

350
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,100
Shiyi,

351
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,500
this is the most difficult way

352
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,500
to cure the most difficult

353
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
medicine in the world.

354
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,100
It's really the best medicine.

355
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
What do you want to ask?

356
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,900
I want to ask

357
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,900
if Suo Yunshan is not as good as Hua Duo,

358
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,500
but he is not as good as Hua Duo.

359
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
What kind of medicine can he use?

360
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
You sent such a valuable gift.

361
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Ask him.

362
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,500
Suo Yunshan is not as good as Hua Duo.

363
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,300
Hua is a poison.

364
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
He is a medicine.

365
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,300
He is a medicine that can cure many diseases.

366
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,500
But the poison will be 749 days.

367
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,500
He will be in the body for three days.

368
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,100
If the magic trick of the Heavenly Demon Sect

369
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,900
is in the body,

370
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,100
what kind of medicine can it use?

371
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,100
Why did Shiyi ask this?

372
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
The doctor doesn't want Suo Yunshan to be cured.

373
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
He only asks for the medical certificate.

374
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Change the weapon to Sh Brisbane.

375
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
How about it?

376
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,500
The peoplesmith is a demon.

377
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,900
Can't I?

378
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Kill him all over the world.

379
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,300
So how should I know this?

380
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,700
Say nothing.

381
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,700
Shall we fight and call Shiyi?

382
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
I help you fight a bit.

383
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,100
I'll go with others.

384
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,900
Follow me.

385
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Jianchuan, I'll take my leave now.

386
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:33,580
The

387
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,780
Luckily, the demon poison can still be suppressed.

388
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,680
Before Shifu and Mo Xiao recover,

389
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,580
we must find a way to remove the demon poison.

390
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,380
The smoke is out.

391
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,480
Come, come, come. Open it, open it.

392
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,180
I'll untie it for you.

393
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,580
Untie it.

394
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,980
Xie Liang Yun.

395
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,180
Xie Liang Yun.

396
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Xie Liang Yun.

397
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Get up. Wake up.

398
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
Wake up.

399
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,180
What are you doing?

400
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
I'm looking at whether you're alive or not.

401
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,680
I almost got hurt by the fox just now.

402
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,180
I thought I was going to die in this medicine bucket.

403
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,580
But I was so shocked.

404
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
I was going to take medicine for my parents.

405
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
I was going to pretend to be a patient.

406
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
I was in a medicine bucket.

407
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,780
I was just going to take medicine.

408
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,580
I was so shocked.

409
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,180
Okay, okay.

410
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
This is not what you think.

411
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
That's right.

412
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,380
Shen Yi, what did Senior Lu ask you just now?

413
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,780
He's not suspicious, right?

414
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,380
My old man is already out of the mask.

415
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
How could he have any unreasonable reason?

416
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,780
It's okay, it's okay.

417
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,980
Hey, you little girl.

418
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm done with your busy work.

419
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,980
I'm leaving.

420
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
You're leaving?

421
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
What if Senior Lu comes back?

422
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,580
He won't come back.

423
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,780
Are you sure?

424
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,180
He wants to know.

425
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,380
He already has an answer.

426
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,180
Of course, he won't come back.

427
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,980
Okay, okay. I'm leaving.

428
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,180
I'm leaving.

429
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,980
No, I still have something to ask you.

430
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,780
I'm leaving.

431
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,380
Shen Yi.

432
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,780
Hey, guys.

433
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,980
Master.

434
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,580
You still haven't found him?

435
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,580
Yes.

436
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,980
What's strange is that I've completely searched his account.

437
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,180
Master.

438
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,980
That Ice Manor is still in the snow.

439
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,580
If Mo Xiao finds out,

440
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,980
he'll come to hurt you with the snow.

441
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,580
He won't do that.

442
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,980
Master, give me some more time.

443
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
I'll definitely find him back.

444
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Get out!

445
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
Get out!

446
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Master.

447
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
Master.

448
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,380
Lin Xue.

449
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,380
Wow, you made so many delicious dishes.

450
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,580
You're so skillful.

451
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,980
I'm late.

452
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,380
There's still some wine?

453
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,780
Before drinking,

454
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,980
I need to say some words of wine.

455
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,980
Then you go ahead.

456
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
I'll go first.

457
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
Okay.

458
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
I'll go first.

459
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,780
Okay.

460
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,980
Then I'll wish you a peaceful life.

461
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,580
And a good life.

462
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,380
Okay.

463
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,580
This is your second cup.

464
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,780
Second cup.

465
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,980
I wish Mo Xiao a happy life.

466
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,280
Protect the happiness.

467
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,180
My life without any weakness is like a disease.

468
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Third cup.

469
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:22,980
I wish you a happy and happy life.

470
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
Lin Xuan.

471
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,980
Lin Xuan, what's wrong?

472
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Lin Xuan.

473
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
I think...

474
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,980
I think it's enough.

475
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,980
These three days

476
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,980
are the happiest three days

477
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
of my life.

478
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
Actually,

479
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
I didn't ask you anything.

480
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,980
But I'm glad you're here.

481
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
Lin Xuan.

482
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,980
Thank you.

483
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
What are you talking about?

484
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,980
I was born in the world

485
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
with several soldiers.

486
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,980
My master saved me.

487
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
He took me to the Wolf Mountain.

488
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
You protected me.

489
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Before this,

490
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,980
I never knew what it feels like to be home.

491
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Until I asked you

492
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,980
what you took me to the Wolf Mountain,

493
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,980
to the Wolf Mountain,

494
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
to the Wolf Mountain.

495
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,980
No matter where you are,

496
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,980
you have a feeling of home.

497
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,980
I understood that later.

498
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
You are...

499
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,980
My home is right here.

500
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Lin Xuan.

501
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
From now on,

502
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
I will always be with you.

503
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Now,

504
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
we finally have our own home.

505
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Luo Xiao.

506
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,980
You won't forget

507
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
this place, right?

508
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
Silly.

509
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
Of course, I won't forget this place.

510
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,980
But one day,

511
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
we will meet a real family

512
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,980
that belongs to us.

513
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Don't forget.

514
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
That's not a spy.

515
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
That's not a spy.

516
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,980
That's not a dream of Young Master Shu Shan.

517
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
He has a house with a dead body.

518
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
And a wife with two children.

519
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,980
They are all beautiful.

520
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,980
They will still be two good children.

521
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
From now on,

522
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
I will always be with you.

523
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
Lin Xuan.

524
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
Don't worry.

525
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
I will give you a gift.

526
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,980
I will give you a gift.

527
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Lin Xuan.

528
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
This wine.

529
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,980
Luo Xiao.

530
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
I have three days left.

531
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
I have enough.

532
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
We have a life.

533
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,980
We have a life.

534
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
We have a life.

535
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
We have a life.

536
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
We have a life.

537
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Lin Xuan.

538
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,980
Lin Xuan.

539
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
Luo Xiao.

540
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,980
We are two people.

541
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
We should go.

542
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,980
We should go to the city.

543
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,980
Lin Xuan.

544
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
Lin Xuan.

545
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
Lin Xuan.

546
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,980
I have...

547
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
I have...

548
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
Lin Xuan.

549
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
After I complete the mission,

550
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,980
I will take you to the mountains and rivers.

551
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
The sky is clear.

552
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
The sky is clear.

553
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
I can't see the light.

554
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,980
I want to be with you.

555
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
No.

556
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,980
Don't tell me.

557
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
I only want to see you now.

558
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
Okay.

559
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
I only want to see you.

560
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
I'm sorry.

561
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
I'm sorry.

562
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
I'm sorry.

563
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,980
Chef...

567
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
Chef...

568
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
Chef...

569
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
Chef.

570
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
Louise.

571
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
clothes store.

572
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,660
If Legend ofonas really buffed

573
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,300
Sweetheart

574
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,500
If you really are okay

575
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,600
she'd have left

576
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,700
Senior Lu, I have already come

577
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,980
I let her down

578
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,080
which stuck into the fields

579
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,020
Now

580
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,320
she's seems peeped out

581
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,240
No matters how many times I think she fears

582
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
I don't know how long it will take.

583
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,240
My father and Master Zhang Ming should be back.

584
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Senior Lu is good at finding Master Zhang Ming.

585
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,240
We should hurry and find Brother Mo Xiao's whereabouts.

586
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Take care.

587
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Boy, you really don't need me to help you?

588
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
No need. Please run away.

589
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Don't worry about what's next.

590
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I can handle Liu Yuanyuan and I.

591
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Boy,

592
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
I'll just leave this here.

593
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
If you want to see my old man again,

594
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
you won't know what you're doing.

595
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Old man,

596
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
it's been a long time since I last saw you.

597
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,240
If you want to drink, come to the Fengyu Sect to find me.

598
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
If you have a 18-year-old daughter,

599
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,240
I will definitely come to drink with you.

600
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,240
Okay, I'll leave this here.

601
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,240
I'll go find the wine and herbs.

602
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Why is it a female tiger?

603
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
She wants to drink your wine.

604
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Silly girl.

605
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Who are you saying that?

606
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
What?

607
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
A wedding wine?

608
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
I said you're not good at fooling around.

609
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
You're the fool.

610
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
I'm not.

611
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,240
You're the fool.

612
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'm not.

613
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I'm not.

614
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
I'm not.

615
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
I'm not.

616
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I'm not.

617
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
I'm not.

618
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I'm not.

619
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I'm not.

620
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
I'm not.

621
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm not.

622
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
The Three Protecting Faction.

623
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Why isn't Young Master here?

624
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Where is he?

625
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
He came to find the Divine Doctor.

626
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Why isn't he here?

627
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Don't worry.

628
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
I'll explain to you.

629
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
Young Master,

630
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
you mean

631
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
you pretended to be the young master

632
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
that Brother Lu saw?

633
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
We're also in the war.

634
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
We need to stabilize the leaders of Shushan.

635
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Then we can find a way

636
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
to find the young master.

637
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Yes.

638
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Where is the young master now?

639
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
We don't know.

640
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
We're waiting for his news.

641
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Young Master,

642
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
you're not here.

643
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
I'm here to find the young master.

644
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Young Master,

645
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
you're not here.

646
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
You're not here.

647
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
I'm not.

648
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Look,

649
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
it's a flower bed.

650
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
Let's follow them.

651
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,400
What's wrong with younger and junior?

652
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,580
There is a lot of trouble in Chieauts.

653
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,120
Someone cannot handle it.

654
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,460
Something is wrong with Chieaut.

655
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,580
He has a lot of trouble.

656
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,520
What's wrong with him?

657
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,760
Peony can't do that.

658
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,540
Could Chieaut be able to handle that?

659
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,380
S香!

660
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,200
Muxiao!

661
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,160
Zisuo...

662
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,060
tell us what happened to him.

663
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,360
Mr. Braised Meatيرة,

664
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,780
I have seen a medical checkup här

665
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,920
and the whole body.

666
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,360
I cannot assume

667
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,860
that a target K habe

668
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,420
had disappeared from the MakⅮ этого winter ring.

669
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:46,760
The Yi- climbing得

670
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,280
is that

671
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,640
the Kha bere yuklu

672
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,540
is the only opportunity

673
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,300
Supervisor Leong,

674
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,660
please move quickly.

675
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,180
No need to mind.

676
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,900
You are back?

677
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,980
I'm new here recently.

678
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,700
I came to the Manor for you not long ago.

679
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,140
Come on.

680
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,900
Wait a minute.

681
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,460
You've left your seat...

682
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,220
and moved it to the visage?

683
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
Master, I'm back.

684
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
Why are you back alone?

685
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,060
Yes, I'm back alone.

686
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,560
Since you're gone, why are you still here?

687
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,060
Master said that I was the one who chose to die.

688
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
I'm not the one who chose to die.

689
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
I'm not the one who chose to die.

690
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
I'm not the one who chose to die.

691
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
I'm not the one who chose to die.

692
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,580
I was ordered by Master to leave.

693
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,580
I haven't got my revenge on Master yet.

694
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,580
Of course, I can't leave.

695
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,580
You want to understand?

696
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
I've always understood.

697
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
Okay.

698
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
Since you want to understand,

699
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,580
go back to your Young Master and have a good rest.

700
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,580
Our wedding ceremony is still waiting for you.

701
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
Okay.

702
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,580
Master,

703
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Feng Lixue has left the mountain without you.

704
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,580
Now that he's been exposed,

705
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,580
he must have been planning something.

706
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,580
You should be serious.

707
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
You should be filial to him.

708
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Feng Lixue will soon become my son-in-law.

709
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,600
If you don't speak well,

710
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I'll let you disappear immediately.

711
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Send the new flower mansion to your son-in-law.

712
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Yes.

713
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm sorry.

715
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
I'm sorry.

723
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I'm sorry.

724
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I'm sorry.

725
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
I'm sorry.

727
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
I'm sorry.

728
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,620
I'm sorry.

729
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,620
I'm sorry.

730
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,620
I'm sorry.

731
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,620
I'm sorry.

732
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,620
I'm sorry.

733
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,620
I'm sorry.

734
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
I'm sorry.

735
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,620
I'm sorry.

736
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,620
I'm sorry.

737
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,620
I'm sorry.

738
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,620
I'm sorry.

739
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
I'm sorry.

740
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I'm sorry.

741
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
I'm sorry.

742
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
I'm sorry.

743
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
I'm sorry.

744
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
I'm sorry.

745
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
I'm sorry.

746
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
I'm sorry.

747
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,640
I'm sorry.

749
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,640
I'm sorry.

750
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,640
I'm sorry.

751
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,660
I'm sorry.

752
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
I'm sorry.

753
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660
I'm sorry.

754
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,660
I'm sorry.

755
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,660
I'm sorry.

756
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,660
I'm sorry.

757
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,660
I'm sorry.

758
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,660
I'm sorry.

759
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,660
I'm sorry.

760
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I'm sorry.
