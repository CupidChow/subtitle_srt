1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The South side of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the waves of fog and the wind blows

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The flowers are beautiful and the water is fine

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers in the sea of ​​the world

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like dreams, like you

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, tens of thousands of years, never to be forgotten

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The history is not clear

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain in another world

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Heart invert

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
Uh-oh

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
You can't open the Heavenly Demon Order.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Why not?

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Heavenly Demon Order is a sacred item of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Only the Heavenly Demon Clan can open it.

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
You are not the Heavenly Demon Clan's type.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Although I am the Demon Lord, if I am not allowed to open the Heavenly Demon Clan's sacred item,

38
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,480
I will bring the Heavenly Demon Clan to the Heavens to fight.

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Elder Sect Leader, I'm afraid you know better than me

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
the Xuan Ji in this matter.

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Good.

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Good.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Are you going to disregard the rules and the future of the Heavenly Demon Clan

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
just to make a comeback?

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,480
But I, Xu Yuan Wushuang, will never be able to do anything.

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Today, I will do anything for you.

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
I will protect the sacred item of the Heavenly Demon Clan

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
for my late father's sake.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Heavenly Demon Order,

50
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,480
I am the 100,000 soldiers of the Demon Lord.

51
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Wake up!

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Heavenly Demon Order,

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,480
I am the 100,000 soldiers of the Demon Lord.

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,480
I will protect the sacred item of the Heavenly Demon Clan

55
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
for my late father's sake.

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,480
I will protect the sacred item of the Heavenly Demon Clan

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,480
for my late father's sake.

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,480
I will protect the sacred item of the Heavenly Demon Clan

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,480
for my late father's sake.

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,480
I will protect the sacred item of the Heavenly Demon Clan

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Heavenly Demon Order,

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
I will follow your order.

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
I will follow your order.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
We failed.

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Chong Guang, you can't open the Heavenly Demon Order at all!

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
It's really embarrassing.

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Xu Yuan Xingzhu, don't worry about me.

68
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Since I can find the three sacred items,

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,480
I can naturally come and open the Heavenly Demon Order

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
for my late father's sake.

71
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Heavenly Demon Order,

72
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,480
I will protect the sacred item of the Heavenly Demon Clan

73
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,480
for my late father's sake.

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Your Heavenly Demon Order

75
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,480
can't hurt me at all.

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Uncle Tu, it's been a long time.

77
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Look at what I brought.

78
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Chong Guang,

79
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I brought you a gift.

80
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
I brought it to you.

81
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
What gift did I bring?

82
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Chong Guang, I've been waiting for you for 18 years.

83
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,480
You brought the Heavenly Demon Order.

84
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Did you restore the Heavenly Demon Order?

85
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Speaking of which,

86
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
I should thank Brother Ye Yuan.

87
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Your son, you should have seen him.

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,480
He can be taken away in the Heavenly Demon Court.

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,480
You must have helped him.

90
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Then, can you summon 100,000 demons?

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
You know?

92
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I know.

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,480
I already knew it 18 years ago.

94
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Can you tell me what you know?

95
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Although Lord Ye Yuan has entrusted you with the Heavenly Demon Order,

96
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,480
even if you restore the Heavenly Demon Order,

97
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,480
you still can't summon 100,000 demons.

98
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Why?

99
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
You should still remember

100
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,480
the cry of your son, Bu Zhou Shan.

101
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
What do you mean?

102
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
I summoned 100,000 demons to summon the Heavenly Demon Order.

103
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Only Ye Yuan could do it.

104
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,480
The Heavenly Demon Clan could really do it.

105
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
The Lord Ye Yuan knew

106
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,480
that his son had already been a soldier.

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
So he entrusted the Heavenly Demon Clan to you.

108
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
So the Heavenly Demon Order

109
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,480
belongs to the Heavenly Demon Clan.

110
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
You're not only the leader of the Heavenly Demon Clan,

111
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
but also the one of the Young Master.

112
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
You must not only give him the order,

113
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
but also protect him.

114
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Without him,

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
your ambition will be in vain.

116
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
I understand.

117
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Ye Yuan...

118
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
asked me to control the Heavenly Demon Clan

119
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
before he came here.

120
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,480
He just wanted me to restore the Heavenly Demon Order.

121
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
After his son grows up,

122
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,480
he will give him all the results.

123
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
It's wonderful.

124
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,480
It's indeed a dream of the Demon Lord.

125
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Back then,

126
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,480
I opposed your position as the leader of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

127
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
I entered the Heavenly Demon Garden.

128
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,480
But you didn't expect that I could still survive.

129
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
You still survived for 18 years.

130
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Because I want to see

131
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
the real leader of the Heavenly Demon Clan

132
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
replace you.

133
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
To thank you for telling me this,

134
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,480
I allow you to continue living here.

135
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
I also have to show you

136
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
how I let the Heavenly Demon Clan

137
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
pay two generations of their debt

138
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,480
to pay the price of my great sacrifice.

139
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

140
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,760
ha

141
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
Hurry!

142
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,620
Gather her.

143
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,780
Yes.

144
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Senior Brother.

145
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,780
dimensioned.

146
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,680
Ah, yes.

147
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,920
So you're trying to make friend with elixir.

148
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,160
If we help him up with any Wasserers,

149
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,680
why not give some water to his suspension?

150
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,240
What leaders?

151
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,320
Senior Brother, I'm afraid you can't hide the secret of Mo Xiao's body.

152
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,800
I still can't hide it from you.

153
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,960
The seal inside her body has been opened by the mysterious magic power of the Chonggwang.

154
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,120
At this moment, the demon west has started to rebel.

155
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,840
Although I can temporarily control it,

156
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,760
but that temporary thing isn't a long-term plan.

157
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,440
Is there really no other way?

158
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,000
Why did you and the Sword Master hide Mo Xiao's body from the Shushan?

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,120
And spread it out to the Sword-Central Sect? I can't ask that.

160
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,760
But think about it.

161
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,440
Do you really have to push her to be the sect leader of Shushan?

162
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
You also know Mo Xiao's identity.

163
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,840
If...

164
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,440
You must have also found out.

165
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,840
Now, Mo Xiao has the most powerful magic power.

166
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,640
If Shushan doesn't care about it,

167
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,040
I don't know what will happen.

168
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,640
Senior Brother, this consequence...

169
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,040
When you and the Sword Master spread the seal, you should have thought about it.

170
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,840
Could it be that you two still want to change your fate for her?

171
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,240
This matter, the Sword Master has already had a magical power.

172
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,240
My mission is to definitely protect Mo Xiao and fulfill the mission of the Sword Master.

173
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,040
This matter is a big deal that the three generations of the Sword Master and I can't fulfill.

174
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,440
I can't destroy it.

175
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,040
I can't even retreat.

176
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,640
Mo Xiao can't do it either.

177
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,240
Then what can you do to help her to keep her heart safe?

178
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,040
You will never be kissed by the devil.

179
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,440
Yi Xiao!

180
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
Come here and let me see you!

181
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,040
You two, go to the meeting room.

182
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,840
Who is going to make such a big fuss?

183
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,840
You two, go to the meeting room.

184
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,940
Tell the three to help her

185
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,740
and get off separately.

186
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,140
I'll go to the other side.

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,340

192
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
I'll go to the other side.

193
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
I'll go to the other side.

194
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,540
I'll go to the other side.

195
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
I'll go to the other side.

196
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,540
I'll go to the other side.

197
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
I'll go to the other side.

198
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
I'll go to the other side.

199
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
I'll go to the other side.

200
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,540
I'll go to the other side.

201
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540

202
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540

203
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,540

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,540

205
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,540
I'll go to the other side.

206
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,540
I'll go to the other side.

207
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
I'll go to the other side.

208
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Our

209
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,940
Today, after my father's magical PDいきます,

210
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,940
remember to end his heart.

211
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,340
We cannot let the劍-dead.

212
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
If I have any trouble in the future,

213
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,340
he will be the one who protects the people of the future.

214
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Only you can tell the other person about this.

215
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
The magic power in your body is getting stronger.

216
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,340
I have no power to seal it for you.

217
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
I can only suppress it for you for now.

218
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,340
I hope that tomorrow, when the magic power is gone,

219
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,340
I can remove the magic power from your chain.

220
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
What I hairpin defined as a glorious fortune,

221
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,340
I wish to随 you to live write on the constrained veneer.

222
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Bring the気, come!

223
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,520
Lixue, please accept my pulse for your coming and turning,

224
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,440
as I came to greet you.

225
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,240
On behalf of Soft MC,

226
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,320
I expect you to tell me

227
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,160
how I love you.

228
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,780
Don't worry.

229
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,520
I'll keep loving you

230
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
till the end tomorrow.

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,080
I promise to陪 you

232
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,440
until tomorrow morning.

233
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,100
To thank you,

234
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,200
we've met today.

235
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm fine.

236
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,200
Li Jun.

237
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,040
Don't be afraid.

238
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,880
Don't be afraid.

239
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,640
Don't be afraid.

240
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm here.

241
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
I'm with you.

242
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,040
Don't be afraid.

243
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm with you.

244
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,040
Don't be afraid.

245
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,000
All right.

246
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm not worried anymore.

247
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,960
I'll be with you

248
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
from now on.

249
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,800
I'll be with you.

250
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,960
Don't be afraid.

251
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,520
I'll protect you.

252
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,760
My lady.

253
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,880
According to the news of Mount Shu,

254
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,560
Mo Xiao is the disciple of Mount Shu

255
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,760
who was hurt by the Holy Stone

256
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,000
and the disciples of the Immortal Sect

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
who was killed in the capital city of Fengdu.

258
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,920
He's a great magician.

259
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,040
Mount Shu

260
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,920
will be closed to the Fumo Palace tomorrow.

261
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
Fumo Palace?

262
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,240
Fumo Palace?

263
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,960
Fumo Palace?

264
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,160
Lin Xue.

265
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,520
We have to go to Mount Shu together.

266
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,840
You don't have to worry too much.

267
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,240
After all, the Heavenly Demon Lord

268
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,520
hasn't really opened the gate yet.

269
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,560
He's been trying to get 100,000 magic coins.

270
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,360
Such an important achievement.

271
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,760
Ye Yuan.

272
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,280
How could he do that?

273
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,040
Mother.

274
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,960
Mother.

275
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,640
I know.

276
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,320
The Heavenly Demon Lord has become the Holy Stone.

277
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,320
And the Holy Stone is about to be opened.

278
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,080
Ye Yuan must have the bloodline.

279
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,360
That is to say,

280
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,000
the two times of the Holy Stone

281
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,120
are at the scene of Ye Yuan's death.

282
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,520
I know who he is.

283
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,560
Who is he?

284
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,040
He's the master of Mount Shu.

285
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,040
Mo Xiao.

286
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,720
The Heavenly Demon Lord has been locked up.

287
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,880
He's been locked up.

288
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,960

He's been locked up.

300
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
He's been locked up.

301
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
He's been locked up.

302
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
He's been locked up.

303
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960

He's been locked up.

310
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
He's been locked up.

311
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
He's been locked up.

312
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
He's been locked up.

313
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,920
he's been locked up.

314
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,140
Lord,

315
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,360
come here.

316
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,260
Do you need a bandage?

317
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,960
No.

318
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Yes.

319
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,560
She just said to feed me.

320
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,860
Over there.

321
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,860
I did.

322
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,700
What?

323
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,160
Don't look at me like that.

324
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,160
No?

325
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,940
I know the source well.

326
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,240
But..

327
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,940
Have you now known someone?

328
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,840
I know.

329
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,480
You were hurt by a�손光的神秘魔力 class.

330
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,600
You were tamed by a disciple of Dulin.

331
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,260
You wereATOK very strong word for magistrale.

332
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,460
Yes.

333
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Although Fu Mo Palace is a dangerous place,

334
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,460
I can only do it for you.

335
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
I can only promise you,

336
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,860
don't be wronged.

337
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,460
I will not be wronged

338
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,260
for my own sake.

339
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,260
Get up.

340
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,460
Give Venture in Half Profident general.

341
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,060
The Emperor Chen Feng

342
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,860
Mo Xiao,

343
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,660
remember,

344
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,060
you are health deprived,

345
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Cheng Guang is doing the with Cleet Jungle now.

346
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Enough to look after so many botel emptiness.

347
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,460
You wondered

348
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,960
if she is going to stop Shu Shan Government from Tekken?

349
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,860
What's more important is that you must keep your own heart.

350
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,660
In the future, the path to being a demon is a difficult path.

351
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,460
But no matter what, as long as you keep your master's life,

352
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,260
and keep your heart, you will definitely find the only one.

353
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,860
Whether this time, I can pass it,

354
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,260
depends on whether your heart is firm enough.

355
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,260
I...

356
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,260
understand.

357
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,260
Senior Brother.

358
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,460
I just went to the Heaven's Seat. Zi Feng said you were looking for me.

359
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,660
I was just going to enter the Demon Palace later.

360
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,260
I asked him to come over and stay with the Sword Master alone.

361
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,060
Junior Sister, I know you have always been against the sect's affairs.

362
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,860
Senior Brother also never asked for you.

363
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,660
But the Demon Palace has been built today. The result is unknown.

364
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,860
There is one thing that I have to entrust to you now.

365
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:40,260
Senior Brother, have you already made the worst plan?

366
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,860
No matter what, no matter if it's a demon or a real demon,

367
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,660
it can't be anything.

368
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,260
From today on, no matter what happens,

369
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,460
don't try to protect me.

370
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,060
You only care about your own health.

371
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,460
I have something important to do.

372
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,260
Senior Brother.

373
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:18,260
Senior Brother, yesterday, I was like a demon ten years ago.

374
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,860
Master only called me a mysterious demon.

375
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:28,460
But I know that I was sealed ten years ago by you.

376
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Senior Brother, why is there such a powerful demon in my body?

377
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,860
Why did you and Master hide it from me when you were sealed?

378
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,660
I never dared to ask for an excuse.

379
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,060
But this has already caused me to be in a state of displeasure for ten years.

380
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
Senior Brother,

381
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,260
who am I?

382
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Senior Brother,

383
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,260
I am a demon.

384
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,260
I am a demon.

385
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,260
I am a demon.

386
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,260
I am a demon.

387
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,260
I am a demon.

388
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,260
I am a demon.

389
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,260
I am a demon.

390
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,260
I am a demon.

391
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,260
I am a demon.

392
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
Senior Brother,

393
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
I am a demon.

394
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
I am a demon.

395
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,260
I am a demon.

396
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,260
I am a demon.

397
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,260
I am a demon.

398
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,260
I am a demon.

399
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I am a demon.

400
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,260
I am a demon.

401
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,260
I am a demon.

402
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,260
I am a demon.

403
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,260
Mo Xiao.

404
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Come into the Demon Palace.

405
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,780
General Zu Shan is here.

406
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,620
Looking for maids.

407
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,820
I don't deserve to be a master

408
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,700
My god first

409
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,860
Let's just do as we've been told

410
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,780
utt

411
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,780
cloudy

412
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,380
ч founder

413
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,700
This person is still called trump

414
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,560
It will be decided by that

415
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
I'll take care of you.

416
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
I'll take care of you.

417
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Do you think you can keep me in this state?

418
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Do you think you can keep me in this state?

419
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
I'll take care of you.

420
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I'll take care of you.

421
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Mo Xiao.

422
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Master.

423
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
It's you, Master Jian.

424
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Mo Xiao, have you forgotten?

425
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
I'm afraid that I'll forget.

426
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I'll be in this world.

427
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,560
I'll be a legend.

428
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
I'll be a legend.

429
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I'll be a legend.

430
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
I'll be a legend.

431
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
I'll be a legend.

432
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
You must remember.

433
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
No matter where you are,

434
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
as long as you're in the right mind,

435
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
you'll be in the right mind.

436
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Master.

437
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
Mo Xiao's magic is very powerful.

438
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
He wants to completely cure Ling Hua.

439
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Master.

440
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Mo Xiao.

441
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
He's coming.

442
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
What's that?

443
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
I...

444
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
He's already succeeded.

445
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
What's that?

446
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
I'm not...

447
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
I'm not...

448
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Master.

449
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Master.

450
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Master.

451
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Tian Mo Yin.

452
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Tian Mo Yin.

453
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
You really have Tian Mo Yin.

454
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
You're my son.

455
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Yi Yuan.

456
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Did you see that?

457
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,560
I've found our child.

458
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Demon son?

459
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Mo Xiao is actually a demon son.

460
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
The Shushan Emperor is here.

461
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Don't see me right now.

462
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Take him down.

463
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Yes.

464
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Go to the east.

465
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Go.

466
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
I'm not a demon.

467
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm not a demon.

468
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm not a demon!

469
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Mo Xiao.

470
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
I'm not a demon.

471
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
I'm a person of the sword.

472
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
I'm the future of the Immortal Sect.

473
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Yuan Beichen.

474
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Don't lie to him.

475
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
The three holy stones

476
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
must be blood-scented from the night.

477
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
That's why they can be used to make fire.

478
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
If he's not a demon son,

479
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
how could I make fire

480
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
to the three holy stones?

481
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
He is a demon son.

482
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Yuan...

483
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Yuan Beichen.

484
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
You can't cover your eyes.

485
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Mo Xiao.

486
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Remember what Master said.

487
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
No matter where you are,

488
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
you can't change your mind.

489
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Master.

490
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Brother.

491
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Master.

492
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Master.

493
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Mo Xiao.

494
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,560
You can't change your mind.

495
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,560
You can't change your mind.

496
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
I never thought

497
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Feng Yue Sword Lord

498
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
would take my child away.

499
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Master.

500
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Master.

501
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Master.

502
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Master.

503
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Master.

504
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Master.

505
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Master.

506
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Master.

507
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Master.

508
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Master.

509
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
Master.

510
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Feng Yue Sword has always been a demon.

511
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
He wants to be a demon

512
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
in Feng Yue Sword.

513
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Take it.

514
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Master.

515
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Master.

516
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Master.

517
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Master.

518
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Master.

519
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Master.

520
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
Master.

521
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Master.

522
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
Master.

523
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Master.

524
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Master.

525
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Master.

526
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Master.

527
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Master.

528
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Master.

529
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Master.

530
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Master.

531
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Master.

532
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Master.

533
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Master.

534
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Master.

535
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Master.

536
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Master.

537
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Master.

538
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Master.

539
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Master.

540
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Master.

541
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Master.

542
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
I'm Nie Chang.

543
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
How dare you lie to me?

544
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
I'm a disciple of Mount Shu.

545
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Take Feng Yue Sword back.

546
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Kill Mo Xiu.

547
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Don't come over.

548
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,560
I can't control myself.

549
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Don't come over.

550
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
I'm here.

551
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Go with me to kill Mo Xiu.

552
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Yes.

553
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Go to kill Mo Xiu.

554
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Senior.

555
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
You'd better take care of yourself.

556
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
I'm fine.

557
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I'm Mo Xiu.

558
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
I'm here.

559
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,560
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

560
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Don't be mad.

561
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Don't be shy.

562
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Don't be shy.

563
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Don't be shy.

564
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Don't be shy.

565
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Don't be shy.

566
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Why?

567
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Why do you know I'm a demon?

568
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Why do you want me to be your doctor?

569
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
Why?

570
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Why?

571
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Why?

572
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
Mo Xiu.

573
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
You're a demon.

574
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
You're going to suffer today.

575
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
I want to avenge our ancestors.

576
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Stop!

577
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Stop!

578
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
How dare you kill Tong Wen?

579
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
Mo Xiao!

580
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Mo Xiao has killed Tong Wen.

581
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Master Xie, save me!

582
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Nonsense! You're the mother!

583
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Take this demon dead.

584
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Come on, Li Jianzhen!

585
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Master Xie!

586
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
Master Xie!

587
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

588
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,560
You don't need to protect me.

589
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
I'm not good at your sword skills.

590
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,560
But I'm not afraid of bugs.

591
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
Let's protect each other.

592
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Okay, brother.

593
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
Heaven enters the earth.

594
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
The mountains are alive.

595
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
I'll give you my brother.

596
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
Mo Xiao.

597
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,560
When did you become the chief of Mount Zu?

598
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,560
If I didn't accompany you in Xuanqing Courtyard,

599
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
you wouldn't have killed yourself.

600
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I'll help you to save your life.

601
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
I'll steal the things from Xuanqing Courtyard.

602
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Don't tell anyone else.

603
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
You don't believe me?

604
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
You're a demon.

605
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,560
I can't watch you kill Shushan and Tong Wen.

606
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
I didn't kill Tong Wen.

607
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,560
The leaves of the mountains are silent.

608
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,560
The heart is too cold.

609
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,560
The soul is still alive.

610
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,560
The people are scattered.

611
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
The moonlight is fading.

612
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,560
It's like a jade.

613
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
The wind is blowing.

614
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,560
The stars are singing.

615
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
The mountains are alive.

616
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,560
The rain is falling.

617
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,560
The food is delicious.

618
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,560
The fire is burning.

619
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,560
The sky is dark.

620
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,560
The scenery is bright.

621
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,560
The world is noisy.

622
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,560
The mountains are cold.

623
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,560
The youth is hard to love.

624
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,560
The sea is so hard to cry.

625
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,560
The world is so sad.

626
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,560
The world is so sad.

627
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,560
The sun is shining.

628
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,560
The snow is waiting.

629
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,560
The mountains are cold.

630
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,560
The sky is dark.

631
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,560
The world is so sad.

632
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,560
The youth is hard to love.

633
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,560
The sea is so hard to cry.

634
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,560
The world is so sad.

635
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,560
The world is so sad.

636
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,560
The sun is shining.

637
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,560
The snow is waiting.

638
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,560
The mountains are cold.

639
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,560
The world is so sad.

640
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
The wind is blowing.

641
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,560
The rain is falling.

642
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,560
The sky is so sad.

643
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,560
The sky is so sad.

644
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,560
The sky is so sad.

645
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,560
The sky is so sad.

646
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,560
The sky is so sad.
