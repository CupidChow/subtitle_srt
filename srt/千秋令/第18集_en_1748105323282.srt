1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom in the wind

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Always have a wind, a fog, a wolf, a wind, a river

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling flowers, the flowing water, the rain, the flowers in the water

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If the dream is like you

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Always have a thousand years of life, no words, no breath

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The rain is falling, the tears are all gone

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain in another world

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Waiting for you

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you still not asking?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Where is the antidote?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The antidote

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are not poisoned at all

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not me

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You knew it long ago

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I did get poisoned

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I didn't get poisoned

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I just didn't get poisoned

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I lied to the Chinese

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But because I was poisoned again

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So all of this

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Everything you see

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The magic you see

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not fake

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why did you do this?

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You know it clearly

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I want to kill you

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because of this

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can take this opportunity to show you the truth

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I hope

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This dream

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Will never wake up

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But this dream

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Will still wake up

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because I am a demon

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I am the leader of Mount Zu

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I am the messenger of the wind and moon

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I am the hope of many people

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will go down the road

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And the door of the five-spirited forest

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will destroy the evil dream of demons

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And the fate of my life

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I will go down the road

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And the light of the world

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I will go down the road

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And the light of the world

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You did this for these people

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Did you sacrifice yourself?

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I did it for the people I love

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Even if I die

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will save you

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Even if I die

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I will save you

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ok

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I tell you where I want to go

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I want to save you in Li Guhe and Pupu

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The red city is full of red waves

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No one can cross the border

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you want to go there?

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I am the first one in Mount Zu

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
To protect the world and live for the people

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
To see people in life and death

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I have no choice

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have no choice

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I have never seen someone like you

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So stupid

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wait for me to come back

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Wait for me to come back

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wait for me to come back

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wait for me to come back

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait for me to come back

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Wait for me to come back

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wait for me to come back

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wait for me to come back

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait for me to come back

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wait for me to come back

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wait for me to come back

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait for me to come back

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wait for me to come back

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wait for me to come back

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wait for me to come back

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait for me to come back

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wait for me to come back

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait for me to come back

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Wait for me to come back

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wait for me to come back

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wait for me to come back

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You came back so early

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, we were tired of drinking water

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Go to sleep

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,220
I'll go to the main court,

112
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,520
and find out what's going on inside the mansion.

113
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,960
Tell them to move.

114
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,760
As long as no one orders usIGotar to move,

115
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,200
then we'll grant one form of land and two charter.

116
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,500
All right.

117
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
We've already got the token that we can pass through the barrier.

118
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
We can't leave now either.

119
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Why don't we just wander around here?

120
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Walk around? What time is it?

121
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Can we use the machine to do random changes?

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
There are still a few hours left before the sun rises.

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Maybe we can find Mo Xiao before the sun rises.

124
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Let's go.

125
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Let's go.

126
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Is this the dungeon that Senior Brother Lu mentioned?

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
We haven't found Mo Xiao for a long time.

128
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,500
I think he should be locked up here.

129
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Let's go and see.

130
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
What are you doing?

131
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
You're here to pick the person from the county forest again?

132
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Hurry up!

133
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Let's go.

134
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
You must pass through the red dust on me.

135
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Only seven emotions can pass through.

136
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
If you have the red dust in your heart,

137
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,500
you must be punished by the stone of the valley.

138
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
You can't use any magic power.

139
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
You can only use one body to come here.

140
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I'll give you whatever you want.

141
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Da گ ship.

142
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,080
Count the rest of them and tell yourself,

143
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,280
Auntie, I'll get rid of the Xiangido creature now.

144
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,480
Don't worry.

145
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,440
I won't only take revenge on a harem main characters

146
00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:12,220
in the long drafts andン

147
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,500
Wait for it.

148
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Third, you should eat with the kitchen knife.

149
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
You should use the soup.

150
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
You should use the soup stone.

151
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
The sun shines on the moon.

152
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
The moon shines on the moon.

153
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
The moon shines on the moon.

154
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
The moon shines on the moon.

155
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
The moon shines on the moon.

156
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
The moon shines on the moon.

157
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
The moon shines on the moon.

158
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
The moon shines on the moon.

159
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
The moon shines on the moon.

160
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
The moon shines on the moon.

161
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
The moon shines on the moon.

162
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
The moon shines on the moon.

163
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
The moon shines on the moon.

164
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
The moon shines on the moon.

165
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Every morning when the storm stops,

166
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
the waves of taxes rise,

167
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
and we put on our deviceswhite.

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
I knew that you wouldn't leave.

169
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,500
I can't burgers.

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Every moment,

171
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
hundreds, thousands,

172
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
years,

173
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
I can't quit my tear 낙兵,

174
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
流泛,

175
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
the rain on the other side.

176
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,540
After Ming meet you,

177
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,140
but have no one in the world know your name

178
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,980
And talk like bung Seto

179
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,580
Empress

180
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,980
Is Princess

181
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,500
Little Rare

182
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,820
If I'm always like this

183
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,340
I start to feel anxious

184
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,380
I contribute the most

185
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,420
protect you

186
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,100
I

187
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Xia

188
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,220
I'm by His Majesty's side.

189
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,140
I am established by all of you through your warm love.

190
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,180
No one can save the cause by your love.

191
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,340
What do you want?

192
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
A good chance?

193
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,700
I will take it.

194
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,380
frog

195
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:13,280
I need etwas

196
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:51,960
Solus

197
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Father, Father, that's much better.

198
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,280
Out of the above two?

199
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,580
fingertips must stay knotted like that.

200
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,740
And if his death sentence straightens to more then 60ч

201
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:47,740
his death sentence is no longer 20 frente

202
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,060
You're pregnant now.

203
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,860
How are you expecting your life in here?

204
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,860
We have got the token of Jincheng Huan Palace.

205
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
That's right.

206
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,860
But we haven't found the Demon Lord.

207
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
So it is.

208
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Brother Xie.

209
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,860
These martial arts warriors are from the martial arts world.

210
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,860
They have been devoured.

211
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
They can't go through this barrier today.

212
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
You should find a safe place to hide.

213
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
And put them in place.

214
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,860
I will take them to find Demon Lord and get the antidote.

215
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
My Grand Master.

216
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Then you all be careful.

217
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Leave it to me.

218
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Let's go.

219
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
Li Yun.

220
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Be careful.

221
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Let's go.

222
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
Who are you?

223
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
This is Demon Lord, Li leng.

224
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
Let's go.

225
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Welcome to Changhuang Palace.

226
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
You are?

227
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Murong Changfeng?

228
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
Chonggong.

229
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,460
The Temple..

230
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,780
really Instant firework

231
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,260
Your Art医

232
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,760
has caused Monitorая

233
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,680
To turn there

234
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,720
And I am a PHOENIC

235
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:17,900
哦

236
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,300
If you acted by force right now,

237
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,620
주볛會向外人策略終有你,

238
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,380
And continue saying that

239
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,320
if you are now trying to hide your right now

240
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,660
and hand your anger ontop you psychologicalThoughts,

241
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,920
your antidote away to Field of Plenty

242
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,540
and return to Mount Suyu for Classical Law.

243
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,060
Our candidates will be even more offshore

244
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,060
and not be willing to kill you.

245
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,560
You're threatening me?

246
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,560
But I need to be full of hatred.

247
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Do you?

248
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,560
You don't have me.

249
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Your sect leader is still in my hands.

250
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
What's wrong with Mo Xiao?

251
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Village Leader, Mo Xiao has found the antidote.

252
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
All the symptoms in the city are gone.

253
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Are you sure?

254
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Mo Xiao, are you okay?

255
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Village Leader.

256
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Uncle Hongrong, you should leave the factory first.

257
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Leave it to me.

258
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Okay, then you should be more careful.

259
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Let's go.

260
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Feng Lixian.

261
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Your poison is gone?

263
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Jianchuan, you stay here.

264
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Protect this place and help Village Leader.

265
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Yes.

266
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,560
There is still some of the people who were killed by the devil.

267
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
I'll take them there.

268
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Okay, you go.

269
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Cui'er, Ling Yuanyuan.

270
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Let's go to the small courtyard and meet Jing'er first.

271
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Make arrangements.

272
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
We'll meet them at any time.

273
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
After the devil is gone,

274
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
we'll leave the people of the Valley of Love.

275
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
Yes.

276
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Let's go.

277
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
You are indeed the heir of Feng Yue.

278
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
You are so young.

279
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
You made me love money.

280
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
How about this?

281
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
How about you and I?

282
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Just like we were in the night court.

283
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Only our两人是存税,

284
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
we had the same fate.

285
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Others devised a hunre even after the fatal disaster.

286
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Ors can help us.

287
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
18 years ago,

288
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,560
you and Demon Militia stole the Spear Devourer.

289
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
And you returned to Suyu Mountain.

290
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
I didn't expect about 18 years in the past,

291
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
you were still not young.

292
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Was it you...

293
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
You just don't understand me at all?

294
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,060
You aren't thinking of joining me?

295
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,560
Isn'tths are my duty as a named warrior.

296
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
He has already entered the valley.

297
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,960
Maybe one day, you will discover

298
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
that I can change your fate.

299
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,360
You are optimistic and satisfied.

300
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,360
You will finally realize your own mistakes.

301
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,360
They are willing to let me go.

302
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,560
Just like

303
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,760
Feng Li Xue.

304
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,360
Next, you will be the one.

305
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Then I will destroy your demon spirit.

306
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Bring it on.

307
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Jing Er, you were poisoned just now.

308
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
The poison has been removed. It's okay now.

309
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,960
Brother, I will not do anything

310
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,360
that can't be seen.

311
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,360
Of course not.

312
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,160
Jing Er, you have to ask me about this.

313
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,760
I can tell you about Luo Kuang.

314
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Father.

315
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,560
I thought I would never see you again.

316
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,960
What are you talking about?

317
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,760
You are fine. I am relieved.

318
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
You are not?

319
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Cui Er, hurry up and seal the seal.

320
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,160
Send this situation back to Mount Zu.

321
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,160
Let the sect leader and senior brother rest assured.

322
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Yes, father.

323
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,960
Where are the three guards?

324
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,960
They are sitting in the middle of the street.

325
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,960
What happened to Zi Su?

326
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,160
Don't stand there.

327
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Go and have a look.

328
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Yes.

329
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Huo Xiao.

330
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
It's okay.

331
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,360
You have saved the one you want to save.

332
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Aren't you leaving?

333
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,560
There is one more person I want to save.

334
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Li Xuan, follow me.

335
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
You have a chance to regret.

336
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,560
If I say I won't leave.

337
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
Li Xuan, you let go of the image we saw on the TV show of Snow Phoenix.

338
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,360
I will find out the truth about Fu Chou.

339
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,160
Take your Tong Wen Zong with you.

340
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
Master is a good person.

341
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,160
You broke his love.

342
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
He won't let go of his feelings.

343
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,760
Li Xuan, I will find out the truth.

344
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,760
You...

345
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,760
No need.

346
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
It has nothing to do with you.

347
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Li Xuan.

348
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
We must do this.

349
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,360
I will find out the truth.

350
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,960
I will find out the truth.

351
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,560
We must do this.

352
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
You are the heart of the mountain.

353
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,960
I am the star of the demon world.

354
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,560
There is no choice between us.

355
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,960
You don't understand.

356
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,560
I believed you.

357
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,560
But later I found out that everything is fake.

358
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,560
You are so naive.

359
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I am indeed clever for being loved.

360
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,160
But because of this.

361
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,560
I am telling the truth.

362
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,560
If it is not for love.

363
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,560
I am the one who is the master of the mountain.

364
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,760
I am afraid I will never be able to say it.

365
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Your Majesty.

366
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
We have no choice but to kiss.

367
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,160
I can only kiss at this song ceremony.

368
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,560
Without your permission.

369
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,960
You are not a good person.

370
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,360
Tu biomass man

371
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,960
Only last night.

372
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,400
Lord!

373
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,660
Xiao Hu.

374
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,460
Xiu...

375
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,160
Xiao Hu.

376
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,560
Xiu...

377
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,760
I don't know what others think.

378
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,960
But I know it better than anyone.

379
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,320
Actually, you've always been loving the young master.

380
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
But you can't express your love to the door.

381
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,800
This time, you're addicted to love and love.

382
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
So you dare to be true to your love.

383
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,880
I made such a big mistake this time.

384
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,680
Do you think the young master will drive me out of the Heaven's Garden?

385
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,120
Silly girl.

386
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,520
What's wrong with liking?

387
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,800
The young master is so talented.

388
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,520
Which woman in the world doesn't like a man like him?

389
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,040
Besides, you two are in a relationship.

390
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,000
You're in love for a long time.

391
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,480
Zi Su.

392
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,600
Do you like the young master too?

393
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,080
I've already surpassed the love of the man and the woman

394
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,640
for the sake of my liking.

395
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,960
The young master is the future master of the Mount Zu.

396
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,280
The leader of the Immortal Sect is the one I want to follow in my life.

397
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,360
What I want to do in my life is to help him achieve the merit of the Immortal Sect.

398
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,840
So I can work hard for my life.

399
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,760
What else is not enough to satisfy me?

400
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,120
We've been cultivating together since we were young.

401
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,000
Why do you have so many things to do?

402
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,680
But you always make me feel uncomfortable.

403
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm from Feng Yu Sect.

404
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,240
I wish the young master can do everything in his power.

405
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm naturally more obedient.

406
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,720
So,

407
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,720
I've seen through some things.

408
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,600
Will the young master really not drive me away?

409
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,040
The cultivation of the young master is far from us.

410
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,760
He will blame you for this.

411
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,880
But,

412
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,400
Zi Su,

413
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,520
the cultivation of the young master is endless.

414
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,440
We can be together for a lifetime.

415
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,760
Some things will eventually be over.

416
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,240
So,

417
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,680
what you want to sell is what you want to see.

418
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,400
Do you understand?

419
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,360
I understand.

420
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,800
Zi Su, come back.

421
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,000
The young master is injured.

422
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,040
The young master.

423
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,240
The young master.

424
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Why are you injured like this?

425
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,240
It's all our fault.

426
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,000
We didn't protect the young master.

427
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,960
It's not my fault.

428
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,920
It's just some skin injuries.

429
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,520
I'll just wipe the medicine.

430
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,440
You three go out.

431
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
I have something to tell Mo Xiao.

432
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,440
Yes.

433
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,800
Okay, sit down.

434
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,680
Master.

435
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,240
Sit down.

436
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,760
Go.

437
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Feng Li Xue has escaped with Chong Guang.

438
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,040
Yes.

439
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,880
When I came,

440
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,640
the elder brother of the sect kept an eye on me.

441
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,640
If I see you,

442
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,840
I must tell you.

443
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,720
Feng Li Xue must be killed.

444
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,960
But you don't want to kill me.

445
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,080
If you do it,

446
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,640
you can fight,

447
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
I can do it.

448
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,040
Master,

449
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,320
Feng Li Xue

450
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,000
was killed because of

451
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,960
Feng Xing Tian at the time have aassing with Shang Hai thousand years ago.

452
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
Because of them,

453
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,800
remember the Ukrainian 지금 in revenge of me and T horns.

454
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,960
Then Chong Guang took advantage of it

455
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,520
and Tong Brady titted the Demon streets.

456
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,400
But the demon庫

457
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,800
developed because of unknown reasons

458
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
He is also a pitiful person.

459
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Even so, he is the elder brother.

460
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
But it's strange that he came back.

461
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,800
The elder brother is always kind and kind.

462
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,800
But he must be killed by you for this Feng Lixue.

463
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
What's the reason?

464
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Maybe it's because of Feng Xingtian and Qianzun's comparison.

465
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Qianzun is very loyal and loyal.

466
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
That's why he was angry with Feng Lixue.

467
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Alright.

468
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Since you are here,

469
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,800
when you see the elder brother next time,

470
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
you can tell him yourself.

471
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Take good care of yourself.

472
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Master, I know you want me to kill Lixue because of the marriage.

473
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
But Lixue was pushed by my master back then.

474
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
It's been ten years since I met you.

475
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Lixue saved my life at this moment.

476
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,800
This time, I went to the Red City to learn the antidote.

477
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I was so happy to see you.

478
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
If I really have the marriage,

479
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
I would be more like the marriage of Lixue.

480
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,800
How could I kill Lixue who helped me many times?

481
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Master and Qianzun taught me to be kind and loyal.

482
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,800
How could I live without my own life because of the security of my own family?

483
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Master, Xingzhu is back.

484
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Master, Xingzhu is here.

485
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Master, Xingzhu is here to see you.

486
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Who asked you to come in?

487
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Master, please come in.

488
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Where?

489
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
In the front hall.

490
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
You can't come in without my order.

491
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Master, Xingzhu is here.

492
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Why are you here?

493
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm here to see you.

494
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,800
You can't come in without my order.

495
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm sorry, Master.

496
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Master, please punish me.

497
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Where are you?

498
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I'm not sure. I'm poisoned by fake poison.

499
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
I'm in a critical condition.

500
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm not sure if I should reveal the antidote to the demon poison

501
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
and take the red dust.

502
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Please punish me.

503
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Lixue, you're my only disciple.

504
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
I saved you ten years ago.

505
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Do you know why you became my disciple?

506
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
I don't know.

507
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Because you have hatred in your heart.

508
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
You're so cruel.

509
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
You've been suffering for ten years.

510
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
You're so greedy and stubborn.

511
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,800
You're the most helpless person in the world.

512
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Only a person like you can be my disciple.

513
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,800
You've changed.

514
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Your silver is soft.

515
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Your sharpness is healing.

516
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Are you still the phoenix blood I saved ten years ago?

517
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I've never asked you this ten years ago.

518
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Master, how did you know I was a disciple?

519
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
That's why you saved me.

520
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I'm sorry.

521
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
I saved you.

522
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Did you also save me from the phoenix blood?

523
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Maybe it's the fate we're destined to have.

524
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Why didn't you save my father?

525
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Are you blaming me?

526
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
I dare not.

527
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
If I saved my father,

528
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,800
maybe the phoenix blood will be less painful.

529
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Your father was the one who killed Shushan to save you.

530
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,800
If he knew I saved you,

531
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
he would have died.

532
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Yes.

533
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
You're right.

534
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,800
But if he knew

535
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:12,800
his daughter's heart was frozen,

536
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,800
what would he feel when he's in the capital?

537
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,800
The heart of the phoenix has never frozen.

538
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Did you feel the heart of your master?

539
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
Yes.

540
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,800
I, Feng Yi Xuan, am willing to die.

541
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
I'll only take two things in life.

542
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,800
First, revenge for the murder.

543
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Second, I will definitely save you.

544
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Will you be grateful to me?

545
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,800
My face is master's.

546
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Then where is your heart?

547
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Let us ask your heart.

548
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Li Xue.

549
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Come with me.

550
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Come.

551
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Let us see who you think.

552
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
I'm here.

553
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Mo Xiao.

554
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Li Xue.

555
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Mo Xiao, don't come here.

556
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Let's go.

557
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Don't come here.

558
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Let's go.

559
