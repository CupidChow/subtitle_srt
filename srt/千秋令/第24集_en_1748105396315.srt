1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the wind, the moon is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows, the fog rises, the waves rise, the wind blows, the river flows

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling flowers, the flowing water, the shadow of the water

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The flowers in the water, like dreams, like you

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no words, no words

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The history is not clear

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain in another world

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Emperor of the Ming sent someone to bring it to me

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's kind of thoughtful

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Look

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,100
The

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,000
daughter-in-law of the Demon Clan

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How do I look in this?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm not sure

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not sure

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm not sure

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not sure

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not sure

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not sure

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not sure

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Did you wear that white phoenix gold?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why don't you try it on

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and see if it matches

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Guards

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Master

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Take the phoenix gold from the back

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Episode 1

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
From tomorrow

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You'll be my daughter-in-law

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you remember the Demon Mirror?

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Last time, the Demon Mirror asked me

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
if there was a cloth in the mirror

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But there shouldn't be

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Lin Xue

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your heart is beating

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Lin Xue

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tomorrow

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you'll be my daughter-in-law

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But you need to ask me again

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why don't you ask him to come here

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and ask him to come here

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Very well

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It means

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you know your heart very well

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
From today on

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want you to keep this heart

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're the descendant

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Your heart

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
belongs to the Demon Lord

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Since you're the Demon Lord

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want to ask

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What does each person's heart

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
really belong to

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
their own heart?

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's because people

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
don't know how to control their heart

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
they'll have me to control it

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Who will

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
control my heart?

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You can't control your heart, right?

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It hurts

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We're all people who suffer

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But you can't control your heart

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It hurts

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't control your heart

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It hurts

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You can't control your heart

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're the Demon Lord

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can't control your heart

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,680
to speak of me.

96
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,560
What do you think it is?

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,440
Make an arrangement for me.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,800
yourself

99
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,280
I want to ask a question

100
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
this is me

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,760
Yes

102
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,720
Then why don't you follow me

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
feeding their children dry food and onions.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:38,280
It's not that I won't restore myOOOOoo soak z

105
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,280
You are also the new living thing.

106
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
Do you know that

107
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
after the death of the Demon Lord,

108
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
the path back to the beginning of the world is now clear?

109
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
I know.

110
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Li Xuan,

111
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I won't allow such a thing to happen.

112
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Even if I put my life on the line, I will never do it.

113
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
After tomorrow,

114
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Feng Li Xue's life will always be closed.

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Go down the mountain.

116
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Forget her.

117
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Follow me.

118
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
No.

119
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I decided that

120
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
no one can change it.

121
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
I will never do it.

122
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Master,

123
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
are you satisfied with such a thing?

124
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
I will never do it.

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Why don't we go whenever we want?

126
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Your hand is better than mine.

127
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Just go until you see them.

128
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
My hair.

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
It'sございます.

130
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
If we don't fry the oil in the refrigerator then the advice will be just advisor-fruit oil.

131
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Wait.

132
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
They need fungus.

133
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
I wrote it!

134
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
How beautiful you are.

135
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,040
VS

136
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:50,160
Mother, I don't think so.

137
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,700
Lord resting under the moon

138
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I want..

139
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000

I want...

144
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,040
How many of these clothes...

145
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,040
This is a lovely century,

146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
and this clothes is a fixed present for my master.

147
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,040
You can't kill me without my permission at once.

148
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I want...

149
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
I want...

150
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,340
Plz

151
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,940
Plz

152
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,320
We need to cross the river

153
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,100
Please

154
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,580
I treat you

155
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,420
Thank you

156
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,280
Then

157
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,860

158
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,420
2017

159
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,480
Bacchus

160
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,960
Young master

161
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,720
This is Lu Chunfeng

162
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,560
Stop

163
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,340
Don't run

164
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,700
Master

165
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,080

166
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,880
Please wait me until Magistrate glaciers arrive

167
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
It seems that the medicine of the honey demon is strong.

168
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
I can only put the honey demon on you,

169
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
and put it on me.

170
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
I can only put the honey demon on you,

171
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
and put it on me.

172
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
I can only put the honey demon on you,

173
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
and put it on me.

174
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I can only put the honey demon on you,

175
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
and put it on me.

176
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
I can only put the honey demon on you,

177
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
and put it on me.

178
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I can only put the honey demon on you,

179
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
and put it on me.

180
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I can only put the honey demon on you,

181
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
and put it on me.

182
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Don't come over.

183
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Mo Xiao.

184
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
What's wrong with you?

185
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
What's wrong with you?

186
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Mo Xiao.

187
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
What's wrong with you?

188
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Mo Xiao.

189
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Mo Xiao.

190
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Why are you here at this time?

191
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
But...

192
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Thank you for coming to me at this time.

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
I can still hold you here.

194
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
I can still hold you here.

195
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Master.

196
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Master.

197
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I can only feel that

198
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
she can't bear to see someone else anymore.

199
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Master.

200
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Master.

201
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Master.

202
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Please don't go to Fenglin School.

203
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Ziying already knows that

204
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
you will only be exposed to the demon

205
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
and be hurt.

206
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Ziying, don't be so impulsive.

207
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
As long as you allow Ziying

208
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
to become your machine,

209
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
I will be by your side.

210
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
I will not let her down.

211
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
What Fenglin School can do for you,

212
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Ziying will do the same for you.

213
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Master.

214
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I know that

215
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Fenglin School has a military uniform.

216
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Please take it out and put it in my body.

217
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
I am willing to be

218
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
a container for you to raise your spirits.

219
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Don't move.

220
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Let's go.

221
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I dare you to say one more word

222
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
and I will kill you.

223
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Get out.

224
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,640
Who would know how strong a regenerer you are?

225
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,120
Is it true?

226
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,840
Fine.

227
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,740
Li Xух.

228
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,220
Li X Conversation!

229
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,480
Yun Shang, why are you here?

230
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Li Jun, I don't like to owe others.

231
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
I don't like to owe you.

232
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
It's been so long.

233
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Why hasn't Brother Mo Xiao gone down the mountain?

234
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Is Li Xue unwilling to go with him?

235
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
Qing'er, where are you going?

236
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
I'll go to pick up Brother Mo Xiao.

237
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Stop it.

238
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
We didn't say we'd pick up him.

239
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
If he goes down the mountain from another place,

240
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
he'll be with us.

241
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Then we'll go with him.

242
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
It's not a mess.

243
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
But Brother Mo Xiao's health...

244
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Don't worry.

245
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
He'll be fine.

246
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Chase him!

247
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Stop!

248
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Hurry!

249
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Stop!

250
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Hurry!

251
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Stop!

252
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Don't run!

253
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Brother Mo Xiao!

254
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Brother Mo Xiao!

255
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Li Xue, don't use the power of the sword.

256
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Be careful of the counterattack.

257
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Let's go.

258
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Where's he?

259
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Where's he?

260
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Master, he's still chasing us.

261
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
You've been looking for him all day.

262
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
You didn't find him?

263
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Master, Mo Xiao didn't meet with the pilot.

264
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
He didn't use the magic.

265
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
He just kept running around in the forest.

266
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Our men disappeared together.

267
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,480
So I can't catch up with the other guys.

268
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
They lost their minds.

269
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Is there any other place in the world that's not known?

270
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Keep chasing!

271
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Yes!

272
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,480
What a loyal servant.

273
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Master, do you want to keep him...

274
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
No, no, no.

275
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Keep him?

276
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
I want Li Xue to see...

277
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
how I treat the loyal servant.

278
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Take him back to Shao Haogong.

279
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Wait for his master to come back.

280
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes.

281
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Take him away.

282
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Chong Guang is a demon who loves the jade.

283
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
He controls the heart and loves the jade.

284
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
But he can't control the love between the jades.

285
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Now, he can't control the love between the jade and the jade.

286
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,480
I'm sure he'll suffer the pain of loving the jade.

287
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Since the jade is here,

288
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,480
why don't we take it back to the two holy stones?

289
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
You mean now?

290
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Yes, now.

291
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Aren't you going to be with me?

292
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
As the guardian of the Demon Sect,

293
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I, the Immortal Master,

294
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,480
can't move the fire and make it angry.

295
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I hope you two can understand.

296
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
What do you mean?

297
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,480
You're just a human being.

298
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
We're not afraid of you.

299
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Mu Xiao.

300
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Take a rest.

301
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
I'm fine.

302
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
After I cross this mountain,

303
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
I'll give Ling Yun and her master a chance

304
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
to send a secret message to them.

305
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Jing Er's Bota Ling

306
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
will definitely find our trace

307
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
before those demons find us.

308
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
They'll come to pick us up.

309
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
You still want me to go to Mount Shu?

310
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
In the sky,

311
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
only Mount Shu is a place

312
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
where Chong Guang wouldn't dare to move.

313
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
You'll be the safest when you reach there.

314
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
I won't ask you to go back to Mount Shu.

315
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
I'm a demon.

316
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
If you take me back like this,

317
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I'll definitely become the most important place.

318
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Mu Xiao.

319
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm really tired.

320
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
I especially hope

321
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
I can go to a place

322
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
where there's no demon,

323
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
no grudge against the evil.

324
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
In the next two days,

325
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
only our days will be left.

326
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
No one will be able to protect

327
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
the evidence.

328
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
If there's really such a place,

329
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
I'd like to visit it.

330
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
If there really is such a place,

331
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
would you like to go?

332
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Of course.

333
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
Even if there's a day.

334
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Even if you're not in Mount Shu,

335
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
would you like to go?

336
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Of course.

337
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
You'll be enough.

338
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Even if there's a day,

339
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
would you like to go?

340
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Of course.

341
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
But in this world,

342
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm not willing to go.

343
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
I'm willing to go.

344
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
There's no such place.

345
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Here.

346
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Here.

347
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
I'll take you there.

348
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
I'll take you there.

349
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
I'll take you there.

350
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
My wound is healed.

351
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Where is this?

352
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
This is the spiritual pearl illusion.

353
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Spiritual pearl?

354
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
illusion?

355
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
There's a magical pearl here.

356
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
It's a world that's changed.

357
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
It's beyond the three realms.

358
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Everything here

359
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
is the same as the real world.

360
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
It's also unique to the human world.

361
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Who would have thought

362
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
that such a big world

363
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
would be included in a spiritual pearl?

364
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
You mean

365
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
we're in that spiritual pearl?

366
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
That's right.

367
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
This is the magical pearl that my father gave me.

368
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
My father gave me

369
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
the magical pearl

370
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
before he passed away.

371
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
He was worried that

372
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
he'd lose.

373
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Time goes by fast.

374
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Even though it's difficult,

375
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
you can hide from the spiritual pearl.

376
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
The spiritual pearl world

377
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
is outside of the master.

378
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
No one can get into

379
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
the three realms.

380
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Then why

381
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
are you

382
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
so stubborn and greedy?

383
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Then why did you...

384
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,440
Why didn't I escape from the dream?

385
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Because the Lingzhu world

386
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,680
can only be opened once in a lifetime.

387
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,480
And I didn't want to give up.

388
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Of course, I wouldn't have died.

389
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,920
It's all my fault.

390
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,960
It's my fault.

391
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,880
I was Chemistry Effected.

392
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,840
If you can reliable the results

393
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,860
of the module- grand is the only person

394
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,760
that I only want that person to be you.

395
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
If it's true,

396
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I just hope that person is you.

397
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
I was born in Shushan,

398
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
and I'm in Xuanqing Garden.

399
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,760
My life is just for the sake of Shushan and the world.

400
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
I never thought that one day,

401
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
I would not be the heir to the throne.

402
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
I would not be the heir to the throne.

403
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
Who am I?

404
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Where am I?

405
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Who am I to live for?

406
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Who am I to live for?

407
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Da Xuanyuan,

408
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
thank you for

409
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,760
giving me this chance.

410
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,480
Consort.

411
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,080
Only us.

412
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,440
Only us.

413
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Even if one day...

414
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Even if one day...

415
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Song...

416
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,200
Are these two running away?

417
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,640
Is this crazy?

418
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
They must have been crazy.

419
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
If they keep Group levels,

420
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,040
Sponge Boy and Xia시를 will make lose their consciousness!

421
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,680
No way.

422
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,320
We need to find a way

423
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,640
and delay for a few days.

424
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,000
This way.

425
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,360
How about this?

426
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,000
Tell Shuchan there's something he probably wrote down

427
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,120
that doesn't suit Shshan.

428
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,320
They will put us

429
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,480
in a secluded object after 충분halb to protect ourselves against the involvediji.

430
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,320
Shsh�ב and my Energy Master

431
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,040
would like to share these findings

432
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,640
with my Xiao brother.

433
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,760
This way.

434
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,120
You would understand how

435
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,600
much a loser right now.

436
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,200
Why Shiqiao didn't help selling these to Xiao Fei'sbori family?

437
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,960
That was just a guys denomination.

438
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160
Are you smart?

439
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
and they are not heavy.

440
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
If they are not troublesome,

441
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
they will be too heavy.

442
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
They can also make them understand

443
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
that we went to Peach Blossom House.

444
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Okay.

445
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
I will send my father a message.

446
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
What's wrong?

447
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Are you worried about your master?

448
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I asked Po Yun

449
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
to send the mountain for me.

450
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
I wonder if Master received it at this time.

451
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Have you sent it back to the mountain?

452
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Don't worry about it

453
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
if you have to do something.

454
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Mo Xiao,

455
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
didn't we agree?

456
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
In the world of the Pearl,

457
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
we should stop everything from happening.

458
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Only you and me.

459
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Don't worry about it, okay?

460
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
I was not good in the past.

461
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
From now on,

462
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
everything will be ruined.

463
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Only us.

464
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
You mean

465
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
the young master and Jing'er

466
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
and Ling Yun

467
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
will go back to the mountain later?

468
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Yes.

469
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
The young master is injured.

470
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
He needs to rest for a few days

471
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
before he can come back.

472
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Is it the young master

473
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
who asked you to come back

474
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
or the county spirit?

475
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
It's the young master.

476
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Forget it.

477
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Since the antidote is sent back now,

478
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
they can come back

479
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
in two days.

480
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Junior sister,

481
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
after the elder brother

482
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
took the antidote,

483
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
is the wound better?

484
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Fortunately,

485
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
this antidote can cure

486
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
the rootless poison.

487
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
But the elder brother

488
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,160
was poisoned by the mouth.

489
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
And it's been a few days.

490
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
I'm afraid he is poisoned.

491
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
He can't be cured

492
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
at one time.

493
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
But

494
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
everyone can rest assured.

495
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Fortunately,

496
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
this antidote

497
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
can cure the rootless poison.

498
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
It can keep

499
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
the elder brother's life.

500
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
But

501
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
maybe it's been a while

502
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
and he will be weak.

503
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
He can't be hard-working.

504
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Alright.

505
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Since that's the case,

506
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
let's let the elder brother

507
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
rest in bed.

508
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Let's

509
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
think about

510
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
other root-based methods.

511
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
Master.

512
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Master.

513
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Young master Jing

514
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
is back.

515
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Take it.

516
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Senior brother Mo,

517
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
what do you say?

518
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
The young master's wound

519
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
is serious again.

520
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
It's not good to go back to the mountain.

521
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
They went to the peach tree.

522
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
They went to find the stone

523
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
and came to heal the wound.

524
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Why is the young master's disease

525
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
serious again?

526
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Master.

527
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Why don't we

528
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
take care of the young master?

529
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
The young master's

530
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
wound is not serious.

531
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
It's just that

532
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
the way back to the mountain

533
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
is far away.

534
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
So they chose

535
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
to go to the peach tree.

536
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
They will be back in a few days.

537
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
You three

538
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
just send the antidote back.

539
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Don't bother him anymore.

540
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Since the elder brother

541
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
needs to rest in bed,

542
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
we shouldn't disturb him.

543
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Alright.

544
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Let's leave

545
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
after we finish.

546
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Yes.

547
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Senior brother Mo Rong.

548
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Please stay.

549
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Jian Chuan,

550
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Liu Shiqing.

551
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
I heard that

552
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
the young master went to the peach tree

553
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
to find the stone and came to heal the wound.

554
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
I want to take you

555
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
to the young master

556
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
to visit the young master.

557
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
I want to ask the doctor

558
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
about the prescription

559
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
that has been prescribed by

560
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Master Wu Gen Hua.

561
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
After all, Master is poisoned.

562
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Jian Chuan is unwell.

563
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
He is unable to take care of himself.

564
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
I hope you can take care of him

565
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
and make him better.

566
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Please.

567
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
I know.

568
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Your master was poisoned.

569
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
You suffered a lot.

570
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
But

571
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
you are still unwell.

572
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
It must be for your master's wound.

573
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Actually,

574
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
you are the master's disciple.

575
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
If Mo Xiao didn't show up,

576
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
the young master's position

577
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
should have been yours.

578
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
You are so fierce now.

579
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
I feel very comfortable.

580
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
It's too much.

581
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Jian Chuan is not willing to bear any grudge.

582
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I just want to ask for your help.

583
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
That's good.

584
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
If so,

585
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
you can go to the peach tree.

586
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
Thank you for your advice.

587
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Jian Chuan will be on the way.

588
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Go.

589
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Go.

590
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Go.

591
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Lin Xue.

592
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Lin Xue.

593
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
I think someone has been here.

594
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Then

595
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,160
it must be the master of the bamboo tree.

596
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
I don't know where they went.

597
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Mo Xiao.

598
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Since we are here in the bamboo tree,

599
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
we can't ask them about the future.

600
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
We can't talk about the past.

601
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
We just cherish the present.

602
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Okay.

603
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Let's go.

604
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,360
A shining bright sun,

605
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:26,120
creating a sky

606
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,120
Have you heard that?

607
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,720
When did you know that You Shan was full of water?

608
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,520
Are you kidding me?

609
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,120
We need to hurry to Peach Blossom House now.

610
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,720
Peach Blossom House?

611
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,520
Why are we going there?

612
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,720
We just changed the reason why he's there.

613
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,920
He's not really there.

614
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,320
It's because he's not there.

615
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,720
That's why we're going there.

616
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,520
Think about it.

617
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,120
If you know that the person who led the group

618
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
who had a serious injury to Mo Xiao,

619
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,520
and he didn't come to save her,

620
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,120
even if he didn't come in person,

621
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,520
wouldn't he also invite the disciples of Mount Shuxuan to visit him?

622
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,920
Then why don't we just go through the way?

623
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,120
Yes.

624
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,320
So, let's hurry and go.

625
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,320
Are you sure that Chongguang isn't in the secret chamber?

626
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,920
His mother has already discussed with him.

627
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
How could he still be in the secret chamber?

628
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,520
Chen Taiwu Xia is probably just in time tonight.

629
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,120
Let's go.

630
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,320
Let's go.

631
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,120
Let's go.

632
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,120
Why isn't Wu Yan's holy stone here?

633
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
The fairy is here.

634
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,520
Maybe it's just like the holy stone of Ayu.

635
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,920
It's too hard for her to get into the palace.

636
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,520
Chongguang is now choosing to force her to train in the Demon Palace.

637
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,320
She won't allow others to enter.

638
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,120
She must be trying to raise her power with the holy stone.

639
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,520
The holy stone must be here.

640
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,920
Let's look for it carefully.

641
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,720
Two Star Masters.

642
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,720
How could you find such an important holy stone so easily?

643
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
It's over there.

644
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,920
Let's just choose a item then.

645
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,520
I salute you.

646
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,320
You two are so делает-plus.

647
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Why do you want to know?

648
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Okay.

649
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Eighteen years ago, if you didn't send Yong Yeyue away,

650
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
he wouldn't have gone to Buzhou Mountain to get some money.

651
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320
He wouldn't have risked his life for this.

652
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,320
This bet will not only be my loss,

653
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
but also your loss of honor.

654
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
I'm a little worried about you.

655
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
I'm not worried about you.

656
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
I'm just worried about you.

657
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
I'm just worried about you.

658
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,320
I'm just worried about you.

659
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,320
I'm just worried about you.

660
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
I'm just worried about you.

661
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,320
I'm just worried about you.

662
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
I'm just worried about you.

663
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,320
I'm just worried about you.

664
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
I'm just worried about you.

665
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
I'm just worried about you.

666
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
I'm just worried about you.

667
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
I'm just worried about you.

668
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
I'm just worried about you.

669
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm just worried about you.

670
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,320
I'm just worried about you.

671
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,320
I'm just worried about you.

672
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
I'm just worried about you.

673
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
I'm just worried about you.

674
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I'm just worried about you.

675
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
I'm just worried about you.

676
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,320
I'm just worried about you.

677
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,320
I'm just worried about you.

678
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,320
I'm just worried about you.

679
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
I'm just worried about you.

680
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
I'm just worried about you.

681
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
I'm just worried about you.

682
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
I'm just worried about you.

683
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
I'm just worried about you.

684
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm just worried about you.

685
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
I'm just worried about you.

686
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,320

688
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,320
I'm just worried about you.

00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,320
I'm just worried about you.

690
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,320
I'm just worried about you.

691
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
I'm just worried about you.

692
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,320
I'm just worried about you.

693
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,320
I'm just worried about you.

694
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,320
I'm just worried about you.

695
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,320

696
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,320
