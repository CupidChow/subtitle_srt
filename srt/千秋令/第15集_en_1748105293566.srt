1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Flowers are blooming and the wind is blowing

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the month in the world

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Always the wind blows, the fog rises, the waves blow, the wind blows, the river flows

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,400
The falling flowers are flowing, the water is no longer

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,000
The flowers of my life are like a dream, like you

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Always the moment, thousands of years, never stop, be careful

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The history is not clear

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain of another life

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Waiting for you

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Every corner, look carefully.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm well.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's my fault.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Serve the spare people to不知道

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We're in power.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was right.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't sound like you've done nothing

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to go into the fields

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,620
I want the Zer fossil

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,500
Sorry,bye.

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,460
Brothers.

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Ling Yu.

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Ling Yu.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
How are you?

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Is it a nightmare again?

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Where do you feel comfortable?

44
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Uncle Qing.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Do you want to save your uncle Xuan Chen?

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Father.

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Don't stop me.

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Qing Er is to save me.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I must save him.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Ling Yu.

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Qing Er.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Ling Yu. Listen to me.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I must save him.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Ling Yu.

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I must save him.

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Ling Yu.

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Ling Er.

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I must save Qing Er.

59
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Ling Yu.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Calm down.

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Qing Er.

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Qing Er.

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Qing Er.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Qing Er.

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Uncle Xuan Chen.

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Qing Er.

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Go and ask Uncle Xuan Chen.

68
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Qing Er.

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Go.

70
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Go and ask Uncle Xuan Chen.

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
I must save him.

72
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I must save him.

73
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Qing Er.

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Qing Er.

75
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Qing Er.

76
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Qing Er.

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Young Master.

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
How is it?

79
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
It's not.

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Keep looking.

81
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Young Master, look.

82
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Go and have a look.

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Go.

84
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Go.

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Go.

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Go.

87
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Go.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Go.

89
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Go.

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Go.

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Go.

92
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
It's the chief's gate.

93
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,460
Every minute is lostCT

94
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Come.

95
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,380
Bro

96
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,900
My Lord

97
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,220
Haven' see Fresh 광

98
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,620
Young Master, you can't get married.

99
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,140
We have no place to ask.

100
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,380
Young Master Murong,

101
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,700
Young Master and Young Master Jing are together.

102
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,780
Since Young Master is here,

103
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,380
why don't you and Young Master Jing come?

104
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,460
How about this?

105
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,260
Let's take the young master to the temple

106
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,420
and bring him here.

107
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,500
Let's discuss it again.

108
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,460
Yes.

109
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,860
Junior Sister,

110
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,700
how is Mo Xiao's injury?

111
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,580
His most serious injury

112
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,540
is in the chest.

113
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,140
But not the shoulder injury.

114
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,300
It seems that he was hurt

115
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,940
by a soft chain that is used to keep the sword.

116
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,220
Feng Li Xue's Feng Yu chain?

117
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,500
Senior Brother,

118
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,940
don't you think it's strange?

119
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,460
What strange?

120
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,020
Don't you know your disciple?

121
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,980
If it's just a minor injury,

122
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,020
how could it be that he's unconscious?

123
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,020
You mean he has other internal injuries?

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,380
When I was healing him just now,

125
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,300
I found that his spirit

126
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,220
was completely turned around.

127
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,420
But why?

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,540
I can only

129
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,020
come back to look for him after he wakes up.

130
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,220
I'll go back and make him some soup.

131
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,140
Okay.

132
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,340
Mister Lei Huan,

133
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,100
I believe they will write down!

134
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,900
Very dang disks.

135
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,440
See, good integrity

136
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,560
I am counts the�마

137
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,320
phin you lose in your life

138
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,460
The removal of��

139
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,660
Mr. Nan.

140
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,340
pent.

141
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,860
Ten thousand?

142
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,060
I came here to ask for you.

143
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,780
Ask for me? Who?

144
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,660
Mo Xiao.

145
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,140
Mo Xiao?

146
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
Senior Qingxu.

147
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,660
What's going on?

148
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,620
My disciple Haotian

149
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,220
is in the Moon Pavilion.

150
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,100
He's guarding the water and qilin of Penglai.

151
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,660
On the clear island of Zhi Yin,

152
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,980
your disciple Mo Xiao

153
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,300
is unwilling to meet with Mother Feng Li Xue.

154
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,660
He was taken by your disciple Lu Jianchuan

155
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,300
and was sent to Zhao.

156
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,420
As a result,

157
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,180
he died on the clear island.

158
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,260
I should ask for the heaven's help, right?

159
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,100
What?

160
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,860
The disciples of Penglai are also on the clear island?

161
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,460
I told my master at the mountain top

162
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,820
that the heaven's help will be with your master.

163
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,340
He will attack Feng Li Xue.

164
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,580
But he didn't kill Feng Li Xue

165
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,260
and he didn't attack Feng Li Xue.

166
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,700
He even let my senior brother die.

167
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
You left the mountain top

168
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,220
and the law firm to take care of him.

169
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,540
Today,

170
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,620
I want you to return my disciple Haotian.

171
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,980
Mo Xiao.

172
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,900
The Moon Pavilion is in the middle of nowhere.

173
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,700
There are many things going on.

174
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,220
They are in the same place.

175
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,340
The heaven's help will be with the water and qilin of Penglai.

176
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,660
There is only one thing left.

177
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,580
The Moon Pavilion is full of new and new enemies.

178
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,100
I didn't expect that

179
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,980
the disciple Haotian loves the most

180
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,220
will be killed by your young master

181
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,100
who is on the mountain top.

182
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,660
Today,

183
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,980
I want you to give an explanation to the heaven's help.

184
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Senior Brother Jin Xu.

185
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,180
Mo Xiao and Lin Yun

186
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,940
have returned from the clear island.

187
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,380
But they are both seriously injured.

188
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,460
Mo Xiao is still in the Moon Pavilion.

189
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,140
Look, is that okay?

190
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,300
When Mo Xiao wakes up,

191
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,740
ask the original friend.

192
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,940
I will give you an explanation.

193
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,540
Okay.

194
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,300
Since that,

195
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,580
I will invite all the disciples of Mount Shu

196
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,780
to come here.

197
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,500
Today,

198
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,820
we will make a deal.

199
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,020
You may come now.

200
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,380
I will leave first.

201
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,940
I will go

202
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,780
to the amulet.

203
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,340
Okay.

204
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,020
Xiao Jiang

205
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:37,580
Xiao Sect's

206
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,220
leader Yu bring

207
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
You...

208
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Tell me.

209
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Where are my sister and Senior Brother Luo?

210
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,180
Qing Shi Mei.

211
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Senior Brother Luo.

212
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,780
Where are they?

213
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

214
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,100
They are with you, right?

215
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,780
Why are you back alive?

216
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,220
Did they get killed by you?

217
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
Tell me.

218
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
I remember now.

219
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
The sky is dark.

220
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,220
The sky is dark.

221
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
I'll go tell the master.

222
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
I'm asking you now.

223
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Where are they?

224
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
Are they really dead?

225
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,220
I don't know.

226
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
It's all you.

227
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
It's all you.

228
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
You killed them.

229
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,220
It's all you killed my sister and Tong Men.

230
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Why?

231
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
Why?

232
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,220
Why didn't you kill the demon girl

233
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,220
when you took the sect leader's power?

234
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
You want to let her go

235
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
and kill Jin'er and Tong Men?

236
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,220
I'll let you be a little bit more careful.

237
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
Then you can fight.

238
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Stop.

239
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
Brother Luo.

240
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,220
Senior Brother Luo.

241
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
Don't worry.

242
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
I'll find out the truth.

243
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
I'll give you a lesson.

244
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,180
Do you remember why they disappeared

245
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,220
Mo Xiang.

246
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Do you think

247
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Are they still alive?

248
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
No matter if they are dead or alive,

249
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,220
we must take them back first.

250
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,220
This is the meaning of our lives.

251
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
You think they are not dead?

252
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
But I can see them not dying.

253
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Since I was killed,

254
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
I thought I would find a mysterious mysterious person

255
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
who is in the forest.

256
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
It seems that I want to find a way to find her.

257
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,220
First, I need to find this person.

258
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,220
What mysterious person?

259
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Since he is a mysterious person,

260
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
I think I will not hide for too long.

261
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Then how can we find this mysterious person?

262
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
I think we should find him.

263
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,420
Princess Dowager.

264
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,820
Old Man,

265
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,220
the Th landscapes were full of commerce visual,

266
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,220
and we managed our country well.

267
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,620
Today,

268
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
I want Mo Xiao to go down in danger.

269
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,620
Senior Bro Qing Xu, do you think

270
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,220
I must thank the God for my菜?

271
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Then we will find out

272
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
How do youbok titles?

273
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
I'm afraid that I'll be killed by the demons.

274
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,220
I'm afraid that I'll be killed by the demons.

275
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,220
How can I not die and die from the same hatred?

276
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,220
I'll be killed by the same way?

277
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,220
What Yuan Shou meant was that

278
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,220
I, Peng Lai, should go find that demon girl

279
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,220
and not come to your mountain of Shu.

280
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
My disciple, Hao Tian,

281
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,220
went to the famous island of Yuan Shou and killed the demons.

282
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,220
He was shot by the demons and killed by the demons.

283
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
That's why he's in a big trouble today.

284
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,220
It's hard for Mo Xiao to commit suicide.

285
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
Master Qing Xu.

286
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
Yes.

287
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Mo Xiao is afraid to break into the world.

288
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,220
We'll punish him with our own rules.

289
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
We don't have to take responsibility.

290
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
If you say it again,

291
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,220
our disciple of Shu is a terrible person.

292
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,220
And he's my son.

293
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Yuan Shou Suo, you're the first one to be a mountain.

294
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
You're the leader of our sect.

295
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,220
You shouldn't be so selfish.

296
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,220
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

297
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Shu Mountain has always been the leader of our three great ancestors.

298
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
I didn't expect that the leaders and leaders of Shu Mountain

299
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
are so selfish and selfish.

300
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,220
We're just like the ancestors.

301
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,220
If we're to follow the leaders of the ancestors,

302
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,220
we'll be humiliated by the people.

303
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Nonsense.

304
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
Why are you so harsh?

305
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,220
No matter what,

306
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,220
you're the elder of the sect.

307
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
How can you say that?

308
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Even the ancestors and the elders

309
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,220
come to question me.

310
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,220
It seems that Qing Xu

311
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,220
has brought the disciple to the palace today.

312
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
He wants me to send my own disciple

313
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
to the Shu Mountain Sect

314
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
to take the responsibility.

315
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Don't do that.

316
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Don't do that.

317
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
Don't do that.

318
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Master,

319
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
you're the master of the disciple.

320
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
You're the master of the disciple.

321
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,220
I'm here to punish you.

322
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm willing to take the punishment with you.

323
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
What punishment can you give me?

324
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
Enough.

325
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
You're a disciple of Penglai.

326
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,220
You're also the righteous one.

327
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
You didn't go to Xiangyao to help us

328
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
to go to the Shu Mountain Sect to shout and kill.

329
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,220
Is that how you use your temperament?

330
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,220
I thought that you were so sad and sad.

331
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,220
So I'm here to forgive you.

332
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,220
If you keep saying that

333
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
and you keep saying that to me,

334
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Master Qing Xu,

335
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm afraid I'll have to

336
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
teach you a lesson

337
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
if you don't teach me.

338
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,220
Do you know

339
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,220
what my junior said?

340
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
Yue Yao,

341
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,220
you can leave now.

342
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
Master,

343
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,220
I'm not good at doing things.

344
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
I've been to the Shu Mountain Sect and I've been to the Ming Sect.

345
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
I have nothing to say.

346
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
But I beg you,

347
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,220
before I take the punishment,

348
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,220
I'll give you another chance

349
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,220
to let me go to the Ming Sect

350
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
and find out the power behind it

351
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,220
and let the Shu Mountain Sect

352
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,220
to be able to do it.

353
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
I'm willing to take revenge.

354
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,220
It's already this.

355
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
It seems that

356
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
I have to tell you

357
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
the truth behind the Sword of the Ming Sect.

358
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,220
Master.

359
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,220
I didn't kill Feng Li Xue

360
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,220
because I was able to get my punishment.

361
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Senior Brother Zhang Man,

362
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
are you out of your mind?

363
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Feng Li Xue

364
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,220
was injured by a mysterious demon

365
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,220
before he fell into the snow.

366
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,220
To be precise,

367
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,220
the four people on the snow peak

368
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,220
were injured by this demon.

369
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
The sword master told me

370
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,220
that the cultivation of the life was passed on to Mo Xiao

371
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
to keep his life.

372
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,220
But Feng Li Xue

373
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,220
could be revived to death.

374
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
There's a possibility

375
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,220
that the behind the back

376
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,220
is related to that mysterious demon.

377
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
To get Feng Li Xue out of the back,

378
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
I had to lower the sect leader's order

379
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,220
and order Mo Xiao to kill Feng Li Xue.

380
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
To destroy all sects in the world

381
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,220
to destroy the heart of the Tian Qing secret sect.

382
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,220
But there's another secret order to pass on to Mo Xiao.

383
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
I ordered him to investigate

384
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
the person behind Feng Li Xue.

385
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
What kind of power is it?

386
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Even the sword master had to

387
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
take on the cultivation of life

388
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,220
to protect Mo Xiao's life.

389
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
Could it be that

390
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,220
everything is related to the previous world?

391
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,220
I'm afraid that

392
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
the world will be destroyed

393
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
if I get the justice first.

394
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
Mo Xiao,

395
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
are you really going to go?

396
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
If you have any problem with me,

397
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,220
you don't have to go back to Mount Shu.

398
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Do you want to be a master?

399
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,220
I...

400
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
am willing to.

401
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
I'm willing to go with you.

402
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
I won't let you down.

403
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
Father.

404
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,220
It's almost done.

405
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
I didn't go down the mountain before.

406
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
I'm fine.

407
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Oh, right.

408
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
This is the sum of pressure from your uncle

409
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
for every year.

410
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
I deducted half of it for you.

411
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,220
You're unreliable, Father.

412
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
I'll pay for it.

413
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
What are you talking about?

414
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
I'm a master.

415
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,780
What are you talking about?

416
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,380
Dad, you can't be so childish.

417
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,180
Be childish.

418
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,900
You've lost your mother since you were a kid.

419
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,100
Your uncle was so proud of you

420
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,220
that he raised you

421
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,500
to be so ungrateful.

422
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,220
If I didn't help you,

423
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,460
what would you do to me?

424
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,220
Dad, I know.

425
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,780
It was all my fault.

426
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,020
I'm unreliable.

427
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,180
You know that?

428
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,340
Are you sure?

429
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,780
So you've got such a第一 Lot hour

430
00:21:52,540 --> 00:22:10,900
once your own country is

431
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,820
known.

432
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,940
My father

433
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Wait for me

434
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,020
Don't go

435
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,060
He is busy

436
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,700
Where should we go

437
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,900
Although your uncle is strong

438
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,500
But his information is in the world

439
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,700
If the mysterious man is a demon or a demon

440
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,220
But he has a smell

441
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,820
So the flower wolf needs an assistant

442
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,660
Assistant

443
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,740
What assistant

444
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,060
Murong Temple

445
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,740
Is it for us?

446
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,020
I'm not going to help you

447
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,460
I'm going to find my sister

448
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,620
It's okay

449
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,980
Who else are you going to find

450
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,420
Anyway, we are the same way

451
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,060
Right

452
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,900
At best, don't do anything to me

453
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,980
This kid

454
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,860
Is more polite than his sister

455
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,500
Greetings

456
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,220
Great Laurel!

457
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,380
Is this the place where here's a다는 kolej

458
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,260
Please go down and take a look

459
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,700
A good man

460
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,700
Recently delivered many people from the counties

461
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,540
Why so many?

462
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,460
當遵居居小WWW

463
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:39,540
it is getting more

464
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,160
It's actually something amazing.

465
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,180
I like this place.

466
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,020
Rich?

467
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,980
I've never heard of this place.

468
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,540
There's a city temple in the middle of the species.

469
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,620
Come down from that direction, immediately.

470
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
if you would spare this life

471
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,860
Don't kill her

472
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,320
I will kill her

473
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,540
Your Majesty.

474
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,620
Your Majesty.

475
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,420
Go.

476
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,400
Uh.

477
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,020
I'm not afraid of you.

478
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,020
I'm not afraid of you.

479
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,020
I'm not afraid of you.

480
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
I'm not afraid of you.

481
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
I'm not afraid of you.

482
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,020
I'm not afraid of you.

483
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
I'm not afraid of you.

484
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
I'm not afraid of you.

485
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,020
I'm not afraid of you.

486
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
I'm not afraid of you.

487
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,020
I'm not afraid of you.

488
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
I'm not afraid of you.

489
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
I'm not afraid of you.

490
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
I'm not afraid of you.

491
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
I'm not afraid of you.

492
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
I'm not afraid of you.

493
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
I'm not afraid of you.

494
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,020
I'm not afraid of you.

495
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,020
I'm not afraid of you.

496
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,020
I'm not afraid of you.

497
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
I'm not afraid of you.

498
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
I'm not afraid of you.

499
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
I'm not afraid of you.

500
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
I'm not afraid of you.

501
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,220
I'm not afraid of you.

502
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
I'm not afraid of you.

503
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
I'm not afraid of you.

504
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
I'm not afraid of you.

505
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,020
I'm not afraid of you.

506
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
I'm not afraid of you.

507
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,020
I'm not afraid of you.

508
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,020
I'm not afraid of you.

509
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
I'm not afraid of you.

510
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
I'm not afraid of you.

511
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
I'm not afraid of you.

512
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
I'm not afraid of you.

513
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
I'm not afraid of you.

514
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
I'm not afraid of you.

515
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
I'm not afraid of you.

516
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
I'm not afraid of you.

517
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
I'm not afraid of you.

518
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,020
I'm not afraid of you.

519
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,020
I'm not afraid of you.

520
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
I'm not afraid of you.

521
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
I'm not afraid of you.

522
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
I'm not afraid of you.

523
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,020
I'm not afraid of you.

524
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,020
I'm not afraid of you.

525
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
I'm not afraid of you.

526
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
I'm...

527
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
Who am I?

528
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
You are...

529
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Feng Li Xue.

530
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I'm going to kill them!

531
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Today,

532
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,020
I'll take you to a god-like place.

533
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
But one day,

534
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,020
I'll let him go.

535
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
I'll avenge you.

536
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
It's you.

537
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
You took me to a god-like place.

538
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
You lost the Soul-Saving Water.

539
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
You forgot everything.

540
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
You hate the death of the demon.

541
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
No.

542
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,020
It's all your choice.

543
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
I just gave you a chance.

544
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
To protect you.

545
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Otherwise,

546
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,020
you'd been killed by your own revenge.

547
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
It's like

548
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,020
the blood of the Zangshen transparent island.

549
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Why?

550
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Why do you want me to have two people's memories?

551
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
And suffer the pain of the dual gods?

552
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Because only this.

553
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,020
You can have a chance to

554
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,020
get revenge.

555
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Now,

556
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
I gave you a chance to get revenge.

557
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,020
And also,

558
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
a chance to get revenge.

559
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,020
What?

560
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
You got revenge,

561
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
but you came back to ask me?

562
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Remember.

563
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
From now on,

564
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
you're not Wu Chen.

565
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Nor Feng Mian.

566
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
You are

567
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Feng Lixue.

568
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
You're my disciple.

569
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
You're mine.

570
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Everything in the future,

571
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,020
I've made it for you.

572
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,020
Look.

573
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,020
I brought you here.

574
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Be careful.

575
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
From now on,

576
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
I'll give you a new beginning.

577
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,020
I'll make you stronger.

578
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
You don't want to know

579
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
who I am.

580
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
I'm just a man.

581
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
You never let me down.

582
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
That's because the time is not here.

583
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
Now,

584
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
you can do it.

585
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
I heard that you've been

586
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
in the Dark Soul Palace

587
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
since you came out of the Demon Realm.

588
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
You're not a man.

589
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,020
Master, you're here.

590
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Greetings, Master.

591
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
This lady is...

592
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
Xu Yuan, the chief of the Nine Realms,

593
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
has been asking about the matter.

594
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
You don't even know

595
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
the person you are.

596
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
Please show me your name.

597
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
Okay.

598
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,020
I'll introduce her today.

599
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
This lady

600
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,020
is the Feng Lixue

601
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
who helped me to get back

602
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
the sacred stone of the Five-Eye.

603
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
And defeated

604
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
the immortal Feng Lixue

605
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
of Mount Zu.

606
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
She's also the disciple

607
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
I received ten years ago.

608
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
From now on,

609
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
she's the young master

610
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,020
of the Demon Realm,

611
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
the Young Master of the Shao Hao Palace.

612
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
Master, you want to be the Young Master of the Shao Hao Palace?

613
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,020
What?

614
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,020
Didn't I tell you

615
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
clearly just now?

616
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
What?

617
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,020
Didn't I tell you

618
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
clearly just now?

619
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,020
Are you the Demon Realm's person?

620
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
I can try it

621
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
or I can't.

622
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,020
What do you mean by that?

623
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,020
Master said I'm the one who tried it.

624
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,020
I'll try it.

625
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,020
Master said I'm not the one who tried it.

626
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
I'll try it.

627
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
I'm the leader of the Demon Realm.

628
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Since I'm the leader of the Demon Realm,

629
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
I've never

630
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
saved anyone else

631
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
from the Demon Realm.

632
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
Master,

633
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
are you going to do me a favor?

634
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,020
The Demon Realm's leader

635
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
and I

636
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
are the only outsiders.

637
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
How can I

638
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
be the leader

639
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,020
of the Shao Hao Palace?

640
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
Miss Lixue

641
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,020
you've been looking for

642
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
the Great Palace

643
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,020
when Wu Yan won the Heavenly Demon School.

644
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
The position of the leader of the Shao Hao

645
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
is a good thing.

646
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
But

647
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
the island is clear.

648
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Shushan

649
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
won't be able to handle it.

650
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
After the Demon Realm

651
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
left the world from the Demon Realm,

652
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
it never had any conflict

653
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
with the Immortal Sect.

654
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,020
It's a trap

655
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
for Su Yushan to keep it.

656
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
But now

657
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
the Emperor of Tang

658
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
has killed Shushan

659
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
and has been

660
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
the leader of the Immortal Sect.

661
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
He's the leader

662
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
of the Heavenly Demon School.

663
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
He will

664
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,020
come to me

665
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
to defend me.

666
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,020
Are you the leader of the Demon School?

667
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,020
I'm the leader

668
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
of the Heavenly Demon School.

669
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
I'm afraid

670
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
you can't

671
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
protect me

672
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
and you can't

673
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
protect me.

674
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,020
If you

675
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,020
can understand me,

676
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,020
even if I'm the third king,

677
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
I can do it

678
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
with my own eyes.

679
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
My Lady.

680
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
How dare you call me My Lady?

681
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
You're a traitor.

682
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,020
I was just

683
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
locked up in the Demon Realm for a few days.

684
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
You immediately

685
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
surrendered to the Immortal Sect.

686
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
You're such a

687
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
ungrateful person.

688
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
I should have

689
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
solved you

690
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,020
with my own eyes.

691
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
Ungrateful?

692
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,020
My Lady, what's wrong with you?

693
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
You're a traitor.

694
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
What's the point

695
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,020
of being so kind to me?

696
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
I've been with you

697
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
for so many years.

698
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,020
No matter how many times

699
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
I hurt you,

700
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
you know better than anyone else.

701
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,020
I can live

702
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
because I'm a big man.

703
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Otherwise,

704
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,020
I wouldn't know

705
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
that day

706
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
I would die

707
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,020
on your Dark Soul.

708
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,020
So you've been

709
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,020
so cruel.

710
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,020
I'm not afraid of dying,

711
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
but I hope

712
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
I can die worthily.

713
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
You're so angry,

714
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
so cruel,

715
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
and so ruthless.

716
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
On your Dark Soul,

717
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
I'm just a coward

718
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,020
who's just

719
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
a coward

720
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
who's just a coward.

721
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
You're so cruel.

722
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
But I have

723
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
the hope

724
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,020
that you can

725
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
die worthily.

726
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
I've got a chance.

727
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
I've got a chance.

728
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,020
Look at me.

729
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
I'm a coward

730
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
who's just a coward.

731
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
If you dare

732
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,020
to hit me again,

733
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,020
you'll be like

734
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
a coward.

735
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
Remember,

736
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
you must figure it out.

737
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Even you

738
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
dare betray me.

739
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
I'll let you

740
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
regret it all.

741
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
What?

742
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
You don't feel

743
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
any pressure at all?

744
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
I don't need to know

745
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
who you are.

746
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
I just need to know

747
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,020
that you're my master.

748
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,020
The one who's the master

749
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,020
of the Heavenly Demon Sect,

750
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,020
the one who's the star of the Shao House,

751
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,020
is not a threat.

752
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Master told me

753
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
that

754
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,020
from now on,

755
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,020
I'll be your master.

756
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,020
Whatever you want me to do,

757
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,020
I'll do it.

758
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,020
Good.

759
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
You're the one who's the master

760
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
of the Heavenly Demon Sect,

761
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,020
not a threat.

762
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
What we need to control

763
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,020
is the human world,

764
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
the sky palace,

765
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,020
and the three realms.

766
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,020
Go.

767
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
Go to your Shao House

768
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
and see if you like it.

769
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
After three days,

770
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
I'll take the responsibility

771
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,020
for you.

772
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
From now on,

773
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,020
you'll live in Suyu Mountain.

774
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,020
As you like,

775
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
maybe you'll live

776
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,020
more comfortably

777
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
in the valley of love.

778
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,020
Chang Huan Palace

779
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
can be yours anytime.

780
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Okay.

781
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,020
I'll take my leave.

782
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
Master,

783
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
I'm afraid that

784
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Miss Li Xue

785
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
will not agree

786
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,020
to be the Shao House star.

787
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,020
What if she doesn't agree?

788
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
What I want to do

789
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,020
is to pass

790
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
their consent at any time.

791
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
How's Aiyu Valley?

792
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Mo Xiao Gu has found

793
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
Aiyu Valley.

794
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Now he's in the city.

795
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,020
The action in my imagination

796
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
is faster than I thought.

797
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Although they've already

798
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
entered the city,

799
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
they're very alert.

800
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,020
They've been investigating everywhere.

801
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
Very good.

802
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,020
So they can

803
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
find the door

804
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,020
very soon.

805
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Miss Han,

806
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
the Shao House star.

807
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Miss Han.

808
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,020
What's this?

809
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,020
This is the waistline

810
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
of the Shao House star.

811
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,020
With it,

812
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,020
Miss can live in Suyu Mountain.

813
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,020
She can also live in Aiyu Valley.

814
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,020
As long as the demons

815
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
can live in the same place,

816
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
the whole world can live in the same house.

817
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
All the palace stars

818
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
are there.

819
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,020
This part

820
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,020
belongs to the Shao House star.

821
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Shao House star.

822
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Pou Yun.

823
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Do you like

824
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,020
my new identity?

825
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,020
No matter what my identity is,

826
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020
I only agree

827
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,020
to follow Miss.

828
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
But...

829
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
I'm just so afraid of you.

830
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
Demon?

831
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Didn't you think

832
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
she was actually a demon?

833
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Pou Yun.

834
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
How did you live?

835
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Didn't the people in the Taoism Island

836
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,020
die already?

837
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
Is there any other identity?

838
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Miss, are you sure

839
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
you want to know the secret of the Demon?

840
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,020
No.

841
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
I killed her

842
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
in the Sky Palace.

843
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
But in Miss's heart,

844
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
you didn't tell the master about the revenge,

845
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
and you felt bad for her, right?

846
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
No.

847
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,020
I'm happy

848
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,020
to be able to take revenge on the enemy

849
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,020
is not the most pleasant thing.

850
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
I'm sorry.

851
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
I'm sorry.

852
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,020
I'm sorry.

853
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
I'm sorry.

854
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,020
Please listen.
