1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the wind, it's warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows, the fog rises, the waves blow, the wind blows, the river flows

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling flowers, the flowing water, the shadow of the water

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers of life

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like a dream, like you

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Always

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years, no words, no breath

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The tears are not clear

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain of another life

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Isn't it just a disease?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why do you still want to kick us out?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The young master said that the doctor is not good at being sick

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You have nothing to complain about

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I was kicked out

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you mean by being kicked out?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you want to be special?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was the one who found the doctor

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Look at you, what kind of old man did you find?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Did you find your personality?

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What the hell is Mo Xiao doing?

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Doctor, it can start

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Actually, my old man is sick

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He is always on the side of the table

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let them go out and prepare my wine first

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What kind of disease are you in?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There is a disease in your body

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a rare disease

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No one can cure it

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why do you have to treat my old man?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are in a difficult situation

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can't save your life

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The world can't have a doctor

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't want to be the doctor

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You saved her

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But you have to support her

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You suddenly disappeared that day

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You went to find the doctor

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What if I escaped?

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You suddenly disappeared the next three days

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I thought you were kidnapped by the evil sects

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What? You start to worry about me?

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm just worried that

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If that phoenix girl suddenly came to the stone

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There is no one

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And there is no helper

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So you are just worried that no one will protect you

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Who wants you to protect me?

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm worried about Miss Wuchen and Mo Xiao

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Of course

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who can compare with Mo Xiao who is in love with you?

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Enough, you are quite good

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can come back in such a short time

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can find the time to save your life

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How did you do it?

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You forgot

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I made an appointment with her before coming

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I had a meeting with her after half a month

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I thought since we have an appointment

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She should be around

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I went to find her

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I found her

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But it's strange

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The Shun Zhen Shishu of Shushan is also a master

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why didn't Mo Xiao look for the Shun Zhen Shishu?

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Instead, he wanted you to prepare the peach blossom釀

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
To find a young man who is a master of the shenlong sword

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is it not right?

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mo Xiao is always a master of the shenlong sword

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He should have his plan

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know that Feng Xingqian looked for me?

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Feng Li Xue's family was in a difficult situation

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They almost got killed in the storm

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Feng Xingqian found you

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can't follow him to the Hanzheng

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But you sent him a cold-blooded sword

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
To prevent the cold

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is why he can be close to the people of Zhou

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He is well-behaved and mature

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But since you know that I can't follow him

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why did you come to me?

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Shen Ye

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I invite you here

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
One is ill

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The other is...

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I want to confirm one more question

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What question?

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That girl

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is she the one who saved you?

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Feng Li Xue

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The head of the King has no skills

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He never lost his hands

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He was born in Qi and Han

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But he is the only one

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He has no skills

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I am so sorry to remind you

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Back then

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That girl

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She was not as good as the normal person

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was so disappointed

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is Feng Li Xue

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I am Feng Li Xue

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Then, Mo Xiao

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How can you send me to the mountain?

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I was born in Qi and Han

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No one can do anything to me

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The cold is cold in the cold

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The water is cold

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The fire is not cool

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Shen Ye, this time you are going to the flower dance

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But you are also here to do the funeral

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ten years ago

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I knew Feng Xintian's parents were so close

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I asked the soldier who shouted at me

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I didn't see Xia Luo

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I thought maybe that baby was taken into a heavenly treasure

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The soldier was not as useful as the baby

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I still want to find that baby

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You never thought

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why would Feng Xintian's daughter die?

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
She is a man of the world

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She is as mortal as a star

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She can sacrifice her life

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That is her fault

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why do you want to kill me?

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mo Xiao

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You think it is related to me?

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Besides Shen Yi

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't figure out who else can be so powerful

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mo Xiao

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You know I am a man of the world

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I am always the one who is responsible for the world

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't worry

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I am just a little worried

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I hope you can give me some advice

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It is just a matter of the heavenly treasure

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I am so lucky

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So Miss Wuchen is Feng Lixue's wife

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I hope you can be more careful

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I haven't told you

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You are so rude

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You are here to talk about me

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You are a good man

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You are so lucky

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I am so lucky

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I am so lucky

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am so lucky

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am so lucky

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am going to the hospital

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will be there in ten years

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I will know the truth

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I will be there in ten years

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The first step is to use the energy of the person behind the power

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
to help him

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to help the people who protect him

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
not hurt by the cold poison

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The second step is to use the energy of blood

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The blood is too thick

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It must be used for a thousand years

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
to help him to use the energy of blood

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A thousand years

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Isn't that the soul of the mountain

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that grows in the snow

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How can we find it so easily

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will go

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You can't go

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You just finished your spiritual power

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are so weak

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How can you go to the place of cold

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I will go

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I will go too

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We will go too

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That thousand years of blood

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
through the spiritual power of the heaven and earth

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It is not fixed in the snow

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I am afraid that many people will be shocked

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
by the blood

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't want to go

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Just go by myself

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Nothing

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You would at least make it

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Only I don't know

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,920
whatheads included

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just do it

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Just do it

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hurry

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
get up

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
First off,

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
my little girl has already lost the third round.

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll do it.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll do it.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Good, keep going.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Good to go.

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm with you.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I won again.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Be happy.

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm not done yet.

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's see if I can make it.

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Good to go.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Good to go.

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm with you.

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I...

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're wrong again.

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll beat you to it.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll beat you to it.

242
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
You're wrong again.

243
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,000
No, you're wrong again.

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You've already had too much to drink. I didn't even drink a sip.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's not good.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't let anyone drink water.

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No.

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're wrong again.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll beat you to it.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll beat you to it.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're wrong again.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll beat you to it.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll beat you to it.

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll beat you to it.

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,560
I can't let you drink alone.

257
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,160
No.

258
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,720
No.

259
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,440
I won't.

260
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,200
I won't.

261
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,640
No.

262
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,320
I won't.

263
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,480
I didn't drink so much.

264
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,280
Look at him.

265
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,040
No.

266
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,480
What are you doing?

267
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,440
No.

268
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,160
Don't run.

269
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,480
You're about to drink.

270
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,280
I didn't drink at all.

271
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,920
Give it to me.

272
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,600
No.

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,640
No.

274
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,160
uncle.

275
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,200
Uncle.

276
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,560
Uncle.

277
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,280
Uncle.

278
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,240
My master.

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,280
How old is he?

280
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,320
My master?

281
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,280
How old is he?

282
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,920
Salted alcohol.

283
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,880
Go away.

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Shen Yi, wake up.

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Shen Yi.

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Xue Lin, you found him?

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You really found him?

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
My little baby.

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I have to get him some medicine.

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It will be effective.

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I found him.

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I finally found Xue Lin.

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What do you want to ask me?

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Do you have anything to hide from me?

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What's the matter?

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mo Xiao, you are always calm and thoughtful.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But you are always in danger for me.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Who are you?

299
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You asked me this question before.

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But I think you have a new answer.

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
At least let me know what is the reason for your life and death.

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Mo Xiao.

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you really love her?

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You are the only heir to the clan of Mount Shu.

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You are different from us.

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What if you really love her?

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What about the future of Mount Shu?

308
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
As a brother,

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,040
I really don't want to see you

310
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
end up in a big city.

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Ling Yue,

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
you are a real man.

313
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You are a man of the world.

314
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Ling Yue,

315
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
do you know why I asked you to ask for the doctor's help?

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I know.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
To cure the cold poison in the body of the immortal.

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The immortal is born with cold.

319
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
No one can cure it.

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Actually, it's not the blood, the medicine.

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Then you want me to...

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Is it really...

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Feng Li Xuan?

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Who is Feng Li Xuan?

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is the problem that I have never solved.

326
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Feng Li Xuan.

327
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Now super Uma Vo door.

328
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Wake up.

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We can go toKungyong Village.

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Open the door.

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You really don't want to see it?

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Clear out the way.

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes.

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,480
between you and Han Milk.

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,640
I cannot evoke it.

336
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,120
I won't leave you alone for a while

337
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,980
for diffusion fish and mushrooms Psalm

338
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,160
I have been

339
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,860
The power is lost.

340
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,720
Your whole family,

341
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,000
have you lost your mind?

342
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,540
Here.

343
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,560
Your whole family!

344
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,120
Li Xue?

345
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,880
Who is she?

346
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,280
She is the daughter of the Heavenly Lord,

347
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,920
Feng Xintian.

348
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,880
Feng Mian.

349
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,040
Does she look like me?

350
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,160
Why do you ask that?

351
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,400
Because

352
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,320
when I was in Mount Shu,

353
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,080
your master told me

354
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,240
the name of the Demon Lord.

355
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,360
I've been listening to this name

356
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,920
more and more.

357
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Does it have anything to do with her?

358
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,680
Why are you wearing it alone?

359
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,520
Zi Feng.

360
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,460
Do you remember the morning

361
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,280
we went out

362
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,040
to pick

363
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,960
up the three of us

364
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,200
during the!",

365
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,760
It was over with

366
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:08,940
Du Leshi's

367
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
Only

368
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,200
All right.

369
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,200
This is exactly

370
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,480
what we had as our duty.

371
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
But why did you ask this?

372
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,000
Did you cause the Young Master's death

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,200
to cause the disaster and blame yourself?

374
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,000
We didn't protect him because of our blame.

375
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,400
If the Young Master's heart is broken,

376
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,680
should we help him?

377
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,280
What?

378
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,320
Don't say that.

379
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,320
You both are not romantic like last time.

380
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,940
like last time,

381
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,440
We lost the question last time.

382
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,320
How can you forget my question?

383
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,840
Why didn't you ask me about this?

384
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,320
I don't know.

385
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,960
I'll do it anyway.

386
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I'm afraid I'll be late.

387
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
I'll be late.

388
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
I'll be late.

389
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I'll be late.

390
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
I'll be late.

391
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
I'll be late.

392
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
I'll be late.

393
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
I'll be late.

394
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
I'll be late.

395
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
I'll be late.

396
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
I'll be late.

397
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
I'll be late.

398
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
I'll be late.

399
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
I'll be late.

400
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
I'll be late.

401
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
I'll be late.

402
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
I'll be late.

403
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
I'll be late.

404
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
I'll be late.

405
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
I'll be late.

406
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
I'll be late.

407
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
I'll be late.

408
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
I'll be late.

409
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I'll be late.

410
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
I'll be late.

411
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
I'll be late.

412
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I'll be late.

413
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I'll be late.

414
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Wu!

415
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
You don't know me.

416
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,560
People of the Secret School

417
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,960
brought me to Mochao,

418
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm here.

419
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,320
You mean youpet me?

420
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
I'm here because

421
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,440
you have a secret identity.

422
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,840
What identity?

423
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,720
IronOS

424
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,240
것類

425
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,840
Feng Rye operator,

426
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,280
you're Feng Rye?

427
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,680
If you don't know, I just don't know why you all say I'm Feng Lixue.

428
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
But I don't know.

429
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,980
You really don't know?

430
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,780
I don't know who I am.

431
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,480
It's ridiculous.

432
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,280
Wucheng!

433
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,380
I brought your favorite glutinous rice cake!

434
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,280
No matter whether you are or not, you'd better disappear earlier.

435
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,080
Young Master.

436
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
What's wrong with Zisu?

437
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
She looks unhappy.

438
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
She is worried about me.

439
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Worried about you?

440
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Your cold symptoms have been cured by Brother Mo Xiao.

441
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
What else is there to worry about?

442
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,580
Wucheng, your cold symptoms have been cured again.

443
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,080
No, I still haven't fully recovered.

444
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,680
Your health is just fine.

445
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,680
You don't need to be so anxious to practice your cold symptoms.

446
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,580
No, I just need to practice hard.

447
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,680
What's wrong?

448
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,280
Did something happen recently that scared you?

449
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,080
Don't worry. We are here.

450
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,280
You won't be in trouble.

451
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,480
No, I won't let you guys protect me forever.

452
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,280
I have my own business.

453
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,880
What business?

454
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,080
What's important is...

455
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,080
Master, Mo Xiao seems to have confirmed Wucheng's identity.

456
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,480
Just a word that can't be saved?

457
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,280
No.

458
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,880
That will only make him more confused.

459
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,880
If he wants to find the answer, he must go to the famous island.

460
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,080
But Master, Wucheng has also lost his mind about his identity.

461
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,080
Since he has left Mount Mang,

462
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,880
there are some problems that he must learn to face.

463
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,840
Master?

464
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
He wants to join Wucheng's camp.

465
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,880
Yes.

466
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,680
He wants to join me.

467
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Master, what's happened?

468
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,880
I'm here.

469
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Master.

470
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Master...

471
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Watching Master?

472
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
My Lady.

473
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
My Lady, you haven't shown up for days.

474
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I don't know how to act.

475
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
Please, My Lady, try it.

476
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
After three days, you will be in danger.

477
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,880
My Lady, are you really going to open up the Heaven Realm?

478
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Po Yun listened to my instructions.

479
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Then do what you should do.

480
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
You shouldn't ask.

481
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
Don't ask.

482
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Go straight.

483
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,580
Go straight.

484
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Go straight.

485
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,480
My Lady.

486
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,480
The harmony between提 ang and the seal peuple was an criticalách.

487
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,480
My Lady, if such special things happen,

488
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
we'll all be killed.

489
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,480
Our Miracle Armor are extremely thirty five hundred and thousand.

490
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,980
That's right.

491
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,980
You saw the entrance of the lake.

492
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,780
Miss Wuchen, who is near Mo Xiao,

493
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,980
has sent out hundreds of double-dead weapons.

494
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,980
And you also said that she has a phoenix seal.

495
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
Your Highness, this time, she suddenly came here

496
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,780
and didn't say anything and kept her mouth shut.

497
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,980
If anything goes wrong,

498
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,580
we can't let Mi Zang get in trouble.

499
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,980
Yes.

500
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
The entrance to the phoenix seal of the Heavenly Star's secret treasure

501
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,180
was given by the master personally.

502
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Now, it's only by opening the Heavenly Star's secret treasure

503
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,980
that it can be proven.

504
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,980
At that time, we will know who is the real Miss.

505
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,980
The phoenix woman promised me that she would take us upstairs.

506
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,580
When will she show us the real Miss?

507
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,780
If you have the order,

508
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,180
it will be the time of the tour of the island.

509
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,780
We will bring you upstairs at that time.

510
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,780
Take it seriously.

511
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,380
I have an order.

512
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,980
Young Master, someone has been searching for the Heavenly Star's secret treasure

513
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,980
with the phoenix seal of the Heavenly Star's secret treasure.

514
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,980
The results are all in the water.

515
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
The Heavenly Star is a city.

516
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,980
If there is such a lot of treasure in the Heavenly Star's secret treasure,

517
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
how could it be easily obtained?

518
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,380
There must be a conspiracy in this.

519
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,980
Young Master has already stopped it,

520
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,980
but he still can't stop them from seeking the fate.

521
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
Young Master, you are so stubborn.

522
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
Oh, right.

523
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Is there any news about the phoenix woman?

524
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,980
After the phoenix woman was born three days later,

525
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,980
the Tongming Island will be in line.

526
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
When this news came out,

527
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
the people's horses were more pure and lively.

528
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
We are all the first to get to the Tongming Island.

529
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,980
Maybe it will be a vicious battle at that time.

530
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,980
I understand.

531
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,980
Zi Feng, tell Young Master Xie

532
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
to get her ready to make a peach blossom drink.

533
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
I will invite the Heavenly Doctor to drink tonight.

534
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Yes.

535
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,980
Yi Qing.

536
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,980
How could there be two phoenix blood in this world?

537
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,940
But Feng Li Xue is my outlaw.

538
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,500
Zion..

539
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,380
The single college is Eyesbnag importantly..

540
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,020
My everything is throughlliogi.

541
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,440
For Xun Shui world,

542
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,060
Minister Chou would include change stores.

543
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,540
On matter of degree,

544
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,860
that's the thing.

545
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,200
How could Xun Shui be?

546
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,780
I'll go.

547
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,580
No, no, no.

548
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,100
We have a talk.

549
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,340
Why only five talks?

550
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,620
You go ahead and check the goods first.

551
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,700
How is it?

552
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,220
Is it the peach blossom of Zhengzong?

553
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Zhengzong, Zhengzong.

554
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,900
It's definitely Zhengzong.

555
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,820
And the rest of the five talks.

556
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,100
Plus these talks,

557
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,540
you put them all in my wine pot.

558
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,540
Tomorrow morning, I'll go to Dongshan

559
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,380
to meet my old friend.

560
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,260
I'm going to fight with him.

561
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,820
With this kind of good wine,

562
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,060
how can I call him this time?

563
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,420
I'll have to make a few more jokes.

564
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,420
Shen Yi can't leave tomorrow.

565
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,980
What?

566
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,140
Why can't you leave?

567
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,980
You let me play a little game.

568
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,060
I'll give you a good one.

569
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,380
I can leave if I have to.

570
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,460
You still need to

571
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,740
apologize to me tomorrow.

572
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
There's another one?

573
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,460
Who?

574
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,180
I'll bring you to meet him tomorrow.

575
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,780
No, no.

576
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,220
We've already said that

577
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,580
one person is one person.

578
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,180
Why are you so stubborn?

579
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,140
I don't want to see him.

580
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,340
I don't want to see him.

581
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:27,860
Ling Yun,

582
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,900
the peach blossom of those five talks...

583
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
The peach blossom of those five talks is still not here.

584
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,340
I'm worried that

585
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,540
it might be the boat that

586
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,100
was hit by the boat.

587
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:36,780
What?

588
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:37,900
What?

589
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,500
Hit?

590
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,820
What are you doing?

591
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,140
You're so impulsive.

592
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,900
You're a good friend.

593
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,820
There's no way to find him.

594
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,380
You...

595
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:50,980
You...

596
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,340
You actually hit him.

597
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
I'm so angry.

598
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:55,900
Shen Yi, don't worry.

599
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,620
The peach blossom of those five talks

600
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,460
should still be on the boat.

601
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,500
As long as you promise to meet that person with me tomorrow,

602
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,460
I'll watch them carefully.

603
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,180
And I'm sure they'll clANG on your old resting area.

604
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,940
That's great!

605
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,420
You...

606
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,700
You guys...

607
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,340
Shit!

608
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,540
My trueников...

609
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,100
Never did any person遊上

610
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,500
the�� no wine when he was in Pearl Den.

611
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,220
I'm so lucky.

612
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,440
Come sit down first.

613
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,620
Master,

614
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,420
No.

615
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,540
The Pugong Ying system

616
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,700
can capture people and pass information.

617
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,940
It's not a secret.

618
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,140
Will the master of Miss Wuchen's mouth

619
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,860
not exist at all?

620
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,020
Or

621
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,780
it's not a human being.

622
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Where is the Fengmian woman?

623
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,260
She was taken by a mysterious person

624
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,860
on the day of Fengmian woman.

625
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,100
She disappeared at the last moment

626
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,780
in the Demon School, Su Yushan.

627
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,140
She hasn't found any more information.

628
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,340
Su Yushan

629
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,420
is really related to the Demon School.

630
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,700
I see.

631
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,780
Keep searching.

632
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,660
Yes.

633
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,500
Don't bother me!

634
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,100
Offer to answer.

635
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,220
Hope we can find the answer tomorrow morning.

636
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Do you mind my coming back this way?

637
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,540
Zuo sitcom

638
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,500
This is the most relevant

639
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,440
Good

640
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,780
There is no treat

641
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,840
And let us keep watching

642
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,640
Let's fight.

643
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,760
Why?

644
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,560
She's the one

645
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,360
who killed her.

646
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,080
Who's the one

647
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,920
who's with Mo Xiao?

648
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,840
I don't think it's the one from Shushan.

649
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,720
Zijin's fox.

650
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,560
The immortal.

651
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,760
The immortal?

652
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,360
The immortal fox

653
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,080
who saved Zijin.

654
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,640
That's right. It's her.

655
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,120
Why did Mo Xiao

656
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,560
find the immortal?

657
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,760
Is she

658
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,280
also on Miss Hui's identity?

659
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,040
Who are you before the mountain?

660
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Wu Chen.

661
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,240
What's wrong with you?

662
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,440
You're so stubborn.

663
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,240
You've come out to practice for so long.

664
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,640
Have you eaten breakfast?

665
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,440
I asked the eunuch to make your favorite glutinous rice ball.

666
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,640
I'm not hungry. I'm not eating.

667
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,640
What's wrong with you these days?

668
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,840
Why do you look so sad?

669
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Tell me what happened.

670
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Jing.

671
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Does your father love you?

672
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,640
Of course. My father loves me the most.

673
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Don't think he's the master of the Feng Yu Sect.

674
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,240
Everyone in the whole sect is afraid of him.

675
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,640
But he can do anything for me.

676
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,240
What kind of feeling does it feel to be loved by my father?

677
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,440
Let me think.

678
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,440
It's probably a feeling that I'm not afraid of the sky.

679
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,040
I'm not afraid of the earth.

680
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
How do you think you like this?

681
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,440
Nothing.

682
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,840
Wu Chen.

683
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,640
Do you miss your parents?

684
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
No.

685
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,240
I've been living in the Mount of Meng since I was a child.

686
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,440
I don't know who they are.

687
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,240
Don't be sad.

688
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,840
Your parents might have some kind of pain.

689
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,640
They're the only ones who are angry with you.

690
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,640
In this world, there's no parents who don't love their children.

691
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,840
Even if they're demons and monsters,

692
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,640
as long as they have children, they'll be able to do everything for them.

693
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,840
Just like the master of the Feng Yu Sect,

694
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,640
his daughter has the same symptoms of Qi Han as you.

695
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,640
He's searching for the world's treasure to save his daughter.

696
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,840
This love of yours is still very touching.

697
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Feng Yu Sect?

698
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,040
His daughter is Feng Mian Nu?

699
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:26,340
Yes. She's the one who's going to open up the Heavenly

700
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,340
I won't tell you the mission.

701
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,340
Don't be angry.

702
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,140
What happened next to your father?

703
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,300
You're only a short-listed person and you're one7

704
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:11,660
On which kind of time does the WenMusic

705
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,300
You guys aren't stupid.

706
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,300
After we've picked up the secret treasure,

707
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,700
you can enter Mount Zu and become a disciple of the Immortal Sect.

708
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,700
Isn't that great?

709
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
How is it? Am I right?

710
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,900
Wu Chen!

711
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Wu Chen!

712
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,700
You're running again?

713
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Wu Chen!

714
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
He's here.

715
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,300
Mo Xiao, you summoned me with the phoenix token.

716
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
You really want to let me go?

717
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,700
You let go of the phoenix token and you became a disciple of the phoenix token.

718
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,700
You were able to get the phoenix token and you're now a disciple of the Immortal Sect.

719
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,500
The phoenix token is now in my hands.

720
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,100
And you're indeed the treasure in this heavenly treasure.

721
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,900
You're now the one who's in the world. What do you really mean?

722
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,500
The one who opened the heavenly treasure was me.

723
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,100
Of course, I made the decision.

724
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,500
How could you make someone believe in such a foolish thing?

725
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,500
Who should I believe in?

726
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,500
I wanted to enter the heavenly treasure so much

727
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,500
that I even brought a helper.

728
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
I don't want to be a smart person.

729
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,900
I'm not a helper either. I'm just a good doctor.

730
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,100
Oh, you're not saving food?

731
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,100
You're not saving food because you suspect me?

732
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,500
You know me?

733
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,100
Of course. If it wasn't for you,

734
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,700
although you've saved my life, you can't cure my cancer.

735
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,700
How could my father go to the Snow Palace of Mount Zu?

736
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,100
How could my parents' lives be explained to us?

737
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,700
Looks like today is just right.

738
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,500
I'll take your three lives.

739
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,300
Is it because of her daughter

740
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,700
that Feng Xing Tian is begging for help?

741
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,100
Your father? You're Feng Ming Xue too?

742
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,700
Exactly.

743
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,700
Be careful.

744
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,100
I said, what kind of nonsense is this?

745
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
You want to die?

746
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,100
