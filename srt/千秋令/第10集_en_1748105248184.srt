1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The South side of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the waves are soaring

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The flowers are flowing and the water is soaring

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers in the sea are like dreams

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like you

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of the future

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of the future

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain from another world

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You are waiting at home

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You are waiting

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
too

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
honored

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
I have all the rooms in reports

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Master, we can't take that many rooms

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can't find so many rooms.

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,160
Sir,

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,760
there are more than 20 guest rooms in this store.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,160
You need them all.

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,120
All of them.

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,080
Sir,

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,960
if you want to take all the rooms in this store,

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,640
you need to pay 50 taels of silver.

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,880
He pays.

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,040
I pay?

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,000
Mo Xiang,

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,240
you have so many guest rooms,

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,280
you want me to pay the money?

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,800
You...

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,680
Mo Xiang.

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
Last time you paid me

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,280
a whole hour of gold and iets.

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,840
Today, you paid all our guest rooms here.

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,480
Even if the money is yours,

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
why do you look so good today?

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
If there's any guest here,

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,960
show them away.

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,080
There's a guest here?

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,000
Who?

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,540
Didn't say anything?

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,680
Sude them easily.

60
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,320
Zisu,

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,760
you three wait.

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,640
pounding hands.

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
playing the guitar.

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Young Master.

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
You three have arrived in Fengdu City.

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Why don't you let Young Master Xie

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
have a good time with you?

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Really?

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
If you say that Fengdu City is the best place to have fun,

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
no one will know better than me.

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Let's call Wu Chen and Jing'er.

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Let's go.

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
We are here.

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Where are we?

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
It's really time for you two to come.

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Let's go.

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Mo Xiang.

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Aren't you going?

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Yes, Young Master.

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
You should go with us.

81
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I won't go.

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
I have to go.

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
All right.

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Let's not bother him.

85
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Let's go.

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Let's go.

87
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Let's go.

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Look there.

89
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Let me try.

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
What is this?

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Here.

92
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Here.

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Little rabbit.

94
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Little rabbit.

95
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,880
This is much decorative.

96
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,880
He is straightforward.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,640
Don't let Shops tell your kids.

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,440
Come on.

99
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
in the future.

100
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,720
You are always drunk

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
when you go to the Heavenly Star Sect.

102
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,800
What?

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
You forgot

104
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
the vow

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,840
you made in front of the Sect Leader.

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
I didn't.

107
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,720
But...

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,760
But the Sect Leader is dead.

109
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
We are scattered

110
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
on the Mount Shu.

111
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
We are not scattered.

112
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
What can we do?

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,920
The Sect Leader is gone.

114
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
The Miss is still there.

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
I've been looking for

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
the Miss's whereabouts for the past decades.

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,760
As long as the Miss comes back,

118
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,960
the Heavenly Star Sect

119
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,480
will definitely be able to rebuild the Xiong Feng.

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
The Huangtian is not a hard-working man.

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,920
I finally got to wait for her today.

122
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,680
The Miss is coming back.

123
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,080
She is coming back to open the Heavenly Star Clique.

124
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
The Heavenly Star Sect is still there.

125
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
In order to welcome the Miss back,

126
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,360
I want to solve

127
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
the problems

128
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,080
of you two first.

129
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
The Great Huling Pavilion.

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,120
Miss!

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Since you know I'm still here,

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
when will the Heavenly Star Sect

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,800
be able to come to the Sword?

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,120
Huo Yun,

135
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
the Heavenly Star Sect is leading the way.

136
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,240
Greetings, Miss.

137
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,080
Greetings, Miss.

138
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,400
Miss is back.

139
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,960
She must be the master of the Sect.

140
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,360
She will protect the Heavenly Star Sect.

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,720
The Heavenly Star Sect is not boring.

142
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,120
My father was killed by Mount Shu by many years ago.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,960
But now the Great Huling Pavilion is not over.

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,360
Why are you still facing this?

145
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,000
Miss,

146
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,320
the past few years,

147
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,920
Huo Yun has been pursuing Miss's whereabouts.

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
Miss, as long as you are safe and sound,

149
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,000
when you are responsible for the Sect,

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
I will follow your orders.

151
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,240
What about you?

152
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
Miss, please forgive me.

153
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,240
I am not a traitor.

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
I am just a master of the Sect.

155
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
I am also killed by Mount Shu.

156
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,080
I can't help you.

157
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,040
Miss,

158
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
Huo Yun will solve the traitor's problem for you.

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Wait!

160
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,720
We are not the ones who are going to kill.

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Miss,

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,360
do you mean to kill Feng Yue's Sword Master?

163
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
Feng Yue's Sword Master is dead now.

164
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,160
But we still have his disciple.

165
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,240
Mu Xiao.

166
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,600
Miss, please follow my order.

167
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I will kill him.

168
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,280
Cut the crap.

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,720
You finally come here.

170
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,880
But you used a trick to kill all the people who stole Feng Yulin

171
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
and led the Poison Lady.

172
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,120
Mo Xiao, you looked dull when you were young.

173
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,560
I didn't expect that you are so clever now.

174
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
You are a dull person.

175
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,000
You look dull.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,080
You are smart.

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,960
You are really Feng Li Xuan.

178
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,440
How do you prove it?

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,000
How?

180
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,040
It's your best breaking elements to kill you!

181
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,840
Feng Yunlian, stop!

182
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,800
Shrich?

183
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,280
I am related to the Poison Lady.

184
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,280
You're here to kill me because you're so fatigued.

185
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
You're here to kill me because you're so fatigued.

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,280
You're here to kill me because you're so fatigued.

187
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
If you really want to kill me,

188
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,280
you don't have to do so much innocent stuff.

189
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
If you don't do so much innocent stuff,

190
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,280
how can you be so kind and kind?

191
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Feng Xintian died that year and he's still alive.

192
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
But I haven't found out the truth yet.

193
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
If you really are Feng Li Xun,

194
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
after I find out the truth,

195
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
I'll give you a lesson.

196
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Don't say such nonsense anymore.

197
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm not Feng Li Xun anymore.

198
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
I'm Feng Li Xun from Fu Chou.

199
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I want all the greedy people to be with you

200
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
and be buried together.

201
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Let's be killed!

202
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Feng Li Xun

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
I want to...

204
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Open the door, open the door.

205
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Your hand...

206
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
I'm fine.

207
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Where's Wuchen?

208
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Wuchen?

209
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
He...

210
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
He didn't follow us.

211
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
I thought he came back first.

212
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
What did you say?

213
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Eat.

214
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Have you finished watching?

215
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
I'll come back tomorrow after I take a break.

216
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
I'll come back tomorrow after I take a break.

217
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Have we ever seen each other?

218
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Since you came with him,

219
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
that's good.

220
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
You two,

221
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
I'll solve it together.

222
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,280
I'll come back tomorrow.

223
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Wuchen!

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Wuchen!

225
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Wuchen!

226
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Wuchen!

227
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Wuchen, wake up!

228
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Wuchen!

229
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Mo Xiao.

230
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Are you okay?

231
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Why am I sleeping?

232
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Where is this?

233
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
It's a dream.

234
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Wuchen,

235
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
wake up.

236
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Wake up.

237
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Wake up.

238
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Wake up.

239
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Wake up.

240
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Wake up.

241
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Where are you?

242
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
You can sleep anywhere.

243
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Do you know it's not safe?

244
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
I was going to go back to the inn,

245
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,280
but I met a strange person.

246
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
A strange person?

247
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
He has a mask on.

248
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I can't see his face.

249
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
But he looks familiar.

250
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I've seen him before.

251
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
But I can't remember.

252
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
The person with the mask.

253
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
When you went back to the Palace,

254
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
you told me that you saw a person with a mask.

255
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
But he...

256
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
It seems like it's not him.

257
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Their mask is different.

258
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Fine.

259
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
It doesn't matter who you see.

260
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
You'll be fine if you don't get hurt.

261
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
But you can't run around in a few days.

262
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Follow me.

263
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,280
You drove us out tonight.

264
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
It's my fault.

265
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
I won't do it again.

266
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Let's go.

267
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
I...

268
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
What's wrong?

269
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
My leg is numb.

270
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
I'll carry you.

271
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Wu Chen.

272
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Where's your family?

273
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Have you ever thought about them?

274
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Family?

275
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,280
I've been living in the Mount of Mang.

276
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
If I were to say family,

277
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
it's Xia.

278
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Before the Mount of Mang,

279
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
have you ever thought about

280
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
who you are?

281
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Why would I think about this?

282
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Yes.

283
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Why would I think about it?

284
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
It's annoying.

285
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
You're here, too?

286
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
I'm here to deliver the order of the Lord.

287
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
He's your Lord.

288
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Why would you order me?

289
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
The Lord asked me to remind you.

290
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
You're here to fulfill

291
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
his plan.

292
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
But you're

293
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
eager to avenge Mo Xiao.

294
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
The Lord wants you to go out.

295
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
He won't let you go.

296
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
But if there's another time,

297
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
you'll never have to show up again.

298
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
He wants to control me, too.

299
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Go back and tell the Lord.

300
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
I'll do what I promised.

301
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
In the next ten years,

302
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
no one can stop me from doing what I want.

303
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
By the way,

304
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Wu Chen doesn't know anything.

305
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
He's the one who can't control me.

306
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
You don't have to worry about Wu Chen.

307
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
You'd better take care of yourself.

308
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Go.

309
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Xiao Qian.

310
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Are you following me?

311
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
No.

312
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I was just worried about your safety.

313
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
And protecting you.

314
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Really?

315
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Aren't you doubting

316
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
if I'm the real Feng Ling Xue?

317
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I never doubted you.

318
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,760
I just have something to say.

319
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,240
It's been ten years.

320
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,760
Where are you?

321
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,840
How can you be so stubborn?

322
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,200
Do you have any plans for coming back?

323
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,840
You mean...

324
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,680
I have to tell you one by one?

325
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't dare.

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,120
I'm just worried about you.

327
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,920
After all,

328
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,120
I didn't see you ten years ago.

329
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,680
Enough!

330
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,120
Don't mention what happened ten years ago.

331
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm no longer Feng Li Xuan.

332
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,200
Don't worry, Miss.

333
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,680
From now on,

334
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,320
as long as there's a cloud,

335
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
I won't let you be hurt.

336
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Then do what I told you to do.

337
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
Yes.

338
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
Miss.

339
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,280
Since you can get along with the normal person,

340
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,040
her anger has already been removed.

341
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,720
Mo Xiao, you're finally back.

342
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,560
Wu Chan, what's wrong?

343
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,760
Are you hurt?

344
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,000
No.

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm fine.

346
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,080
I'm fine.

347
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm fine.

348
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
No?

349
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
Then why did you let Mo Xiao carry you?

350
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,680
Also, do you know you're running around?

351
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,720
We're looking for you.

352
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,480
I'm not running around.

353
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,920
Didn't you leave voluntarily?

354
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,520
Aren't you afraid that I'll be in danger

355
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,920
or that I'll be lost?

356
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,160
It's not Xie Ling Yun.

357
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,800
He kept saying that he's not done with me.

358
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,440
I didn't notice that he was in the right place.

359
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,960
Then it's fine.

360
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,520
Be careful next time.

361
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
I got it.

362
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Okay.

363
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
We still have a long way to go.

364
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,880
Let's take a break first.

365
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,760
The room is all cleaned up.

366
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Are you tired?

367
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,760
Let's go and rest.

368
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
Let's go.

369
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,680
He's just so stubborn.

370
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,240
I guess he can't deal with Wu Chan now.

371
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,440
Don't blame him.

372
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,960
Wu Chan has improved too quickly.

373
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,160
Here.

374
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,440
Bring this.

375
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,480
Mo Xiao.

376
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,940
What are you doing here?

377
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Noting.

378
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,000
I saw that you came back just to hello me.

379
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and help melogim.

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,720
Here.

381
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,240
You don't mean it.

382
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,640
We're still brothers, right?

383
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
He wants to harm you,

384
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,440
so he wants to harm me.

385
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,040
Luckily, we're back in time.

386
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,440
What if something happens to you?

387
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
How can we tell the master?

388
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,400
Actually, he's still

389
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,680
trying to confirm another thing.

390
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
What is it?

391
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,520
Is he crazy?

392
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,880
What?

393
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,280
Is he?

394
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,760
Miss Luo Chili staying at home matched with that of that entire卡와.

395
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,200
How come both of us

396
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,760
have risky behaviors?

397
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,760
How come

398
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,680
Feng Lixue is here?

399
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,840
Mo Xiao.

400
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,360
prospective nurse.

401
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,120
I heard you're injured.

402
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,800
I don't want to catch a acupuncture on you.

403
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Where on earth?

404
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,560
Here.

405
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,200
Have a look.

406
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,480
They've put poison on your finger.

407
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
You won't be able to do that.

408
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Wu Chen, let go of me.

409
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Wu Chen.

410
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Wu Chen, let go of me.

411
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
What are you doing?

412
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Young Master, the painting room is abandoned.

413
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
We should go to the coffin to avoid the meeting.

414
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,520
We came here to find some horses to collect the painting.

415
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
But there are not many horses and two horses.

416
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
We only have four horses.

417
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
We should have two horses to ride.

418
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
It's okay.

419
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Mo Xiao, you and Wu Chen ride.

420
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Zi Mu, Zi Feng, you two ride.

421
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Jiang Er, do you want to ride with Zisu or me?

422
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Young Master Xie, you should ride with Young Master Jing.

423
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Look, no one wants to ride with you.

424
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
It seems that I can only make up for it.

425
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Let's go.

426
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Let's go.

427
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,080
이게 Wu Chen

428
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,020
Phoenix Eyes.

429
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,440
Mo Pou Xuan Yi?

430
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,160
You're from the Heavenly Star Sect?

431
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,360
Very good.

432
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
You still remember our Heavenly Star Sect?

433
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,520
Where's Feng Mian Nu?

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,720
Ask her out.

435
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
This Feng Mian Nu again?

436
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,080
It seems that the sect of the Heavenly Star Sect

437
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,560
has already returned to Feng Mian Nu's mansion.

438
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,200
We need to hurry and go to the Peach Blossom House.

439
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,040
That's right.

440
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,040
We should hurry and go to the Peach Blossom House.

441
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Chang Mein.

442
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,760
Why are you suddenly dropping your hands?

443
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,880
Didn't you notice that if we are to serve Mo Xiao

444
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,040
and give umbilical elf a big gift,

445
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,160
are you casualties?

446
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,920
He must have someone else interesting?

447
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,120
My dear?

448
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,720
What's done is done.

449
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
We should understand.

450
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,440
Devils do not have a friend like you,

451
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,400
and adults do not have a step- ransom.

452
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,840
What has happen between them?

453
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,880
Empress

454
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,760
is excellent.

455
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
It was so interesting and裡IC.

456
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,360
He has also become a podemos저.

457
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,800
Let's eat together.

458
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,280
Go.

459
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,520
How long do you need to endure these people?

460
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
How long do you need?

461
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
How long can I hold on to?

462
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
At least half an hour.

463
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,520
No problem. Take it with me.

464
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
But it's better to hurry up.

465
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Fang Yu Ling is with me!

466
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
If you can, come over and get it!

467
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Chase after him!

468
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Let's go.

469
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Junior Jin, take care of Wuchen.

470
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
You three come with me.

471
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Where are they going? Why didn't they take us?

472
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
They can't take you.

473
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
They're all monsters.

474
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,520
With your ability,

475
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
you still want to steal Fang Yu Ling?

476
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Fang Yu Ling has appeared!

477
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
He's in the ice lake!

478
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
He's not here with you.

479
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
I'm just kidding.

480
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,520
You're still serious?

481
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,520
Go to the ice lake!

482
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
It's almost half an hour.

483
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,520
I can't hold on to my sword for long.

484
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Mo Xiao, it's up to you.

485
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Wait for me!

486
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
They're all in the ice lake.

487
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
It's dangerous.

488
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
You'll see us.

489
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Why are you standing there? Go back!

490
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
I...

491
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
I can help too.

492
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
They're all in the ice lake.

493
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Why don't you go?

494
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
I'll go and see.

495
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Take care of this.

496
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
The gate is open.

497
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
The gate is open.

498
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
The gate is open.

499
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
The gate is open.

500
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
The gate is open.

501
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
He did it!

502
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
He did it!

503
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
He did it!

504
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,520
I'll seal the gate here.

505
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,520
I want to get the seal and go to Tongming Island.

506
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
I'll have to use my sword first.

507
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
It's fine if he gets the seal.

508
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Don't stop us from making money.

509
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
That's right.

510
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,520
The seal is a secret treasure.

511
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
We can't let him go.

512
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,520
We can't let him go into the secret treasure.

513
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
That's right.

514
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I think he wants to take the secret treasure alone.

515
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Isn't he the first one in Mount Shu?

516
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Now that Mount Shu is in the right place,

517
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
he's so shameless.

518
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
He's more brave and bold.

519
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,520
What's the name of the dog door?

520
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,520
This is the name of the disciple of Fengyue Sword.

521
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Fengyue Command took away the seal from us.

522
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Today, he sealed the seal so well.

523
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,520
He wants to kill us and find the way to Tongming Island.

524
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
That's right.

525
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Fengyue Command only has one seal.

526
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
It's not that we have the chance.

527
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,520
But the winner will seal the way to the island.

528
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,520
You're too strong.

529
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Fengyue Command only has one seal.

530
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,520
But the seal is a common wish.

531
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
If we join hands,

532
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
can't we break the barrier?

533
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
That's right.

534
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Can't we break the barrier?

535
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
That's right.

536
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,520
What are you looking at?

537
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
The secret treasure in the sky is a secret treasure.

538
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,520
But there are many evil demons and evil spirits.

539
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
As a disciple of Mount Shu,

540
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,520
we can't let them fall into the human world.

541
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
I'm not a bad person.

542
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,520
But if you break the barrier and make a mess of the human world,

543
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
you can try it.

544
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:42,120
BRIAN

545
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,920
I think we should do this.

546
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Is it too high?

547
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,120
If we let the chief master know,

548
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,920
he will immediately send a message to the chief.

549
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,920
He will take us back to Mount Zu and then go to the Iron Fist.

550
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,320
He's blaming the woman of the phoenix mask.

551
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,120
Next time, I will let him see her again.

552
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,520
Let him taste my great treasure.

553
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,720
By the way, where is Wu Chen?

554
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,520
Wu Chen?

555
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,720
I asked him to wait for us in the inn.

556
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Where is he?

557
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,920
Didn't I tell you to look after him?

558
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
I saw all the people and horses

559
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
went to the entrance of the Ice Lake with you.

560
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,120
The Liu Saikou Inn is no longer in danger.

561
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,920
They asked him to wait for us.

562
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,320
Didn't I go to help you?

563
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,720
You're not helping me. It's a mess.

564
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,320
Okay. I'm a mess.

565
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,120
Then I'm not a mess.

566
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,720
I'm leaving.

567
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Qing'er!

568
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,320
Wu Chen, I'll go find him.

569
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,520
Get out of the way.

570
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,120
Get out of the way.

571
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,120
Chief Master.

572
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,920
Chief Master, Zisu's mission is to protect your safety.

573
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,320
You need to be careful now.

574
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,720
Otherwise, you will be damaged.

575
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Zisu can't let you go.

576
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,520
Huoxiao, just rest here.

577
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,720
I'll go and see Jing'er first.

578
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,120
Then I'll take them to find Wu Chen.

579
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,920
Don't worry.

580
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,120
Let's go.

581
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,120
Chief Master, rest well first.

582
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,520
Zisu is guarding outside the house.

583
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,520
Wu Chen.

584
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Wu Chen.

585
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,320
You know what she means.

586
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,520
Why do you have to be mad at her?

587
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,920
What does she mean?

588
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
I did it for her.

589
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,320
I was worried that she would be in a hurry to help me.

590
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,120
Wu Chen is not a third-year kid.

591
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,920
He's so angry and scary.

592
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,520
Why does he look like a baby?

593
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
I can only scold him.

594
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm not a child.

595
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,120
I'm just a child.

596
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,720
I can only scold him.

597
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,720
He's just worried that Wu Chen won't be able to control his energy.

598
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,320
Plus, he's not in a hurry to set up a tent.

599
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,120
That's why we have to go to look after him.

600
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,920
Jing'er, you're totally different from him.

601
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,320
Look at you. You're powerful and have a lot of skills.

602
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,920
Plus, you have a lot of protection.

603
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,920
You're the one who makes us worry the most.

604
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,520
Am I really that good?

605
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,320
Of course. You've been walking all the way.

606
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,520
The most important thing is that you're fighting with us.

607
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,120
Right?

608
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,920
When you're quiet, you're gentle and lovely.

609
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,320
When you're cold, you're handsome and handsome.

610
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,720
How many girls can you have?

611
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,120
Only you can lie.

612
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,520
I really didn't lie to you.

613
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,920
What I said is true.

614
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,520
Where are you going?

615
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm going to find Wu Chen.

616
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,720
Then I'll go too.

617
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Where are you taking me?

618
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,920
Didn't I say that I want to see someone?

619
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,320
There's no one here.

620
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
That's not right.

621
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,920
No, you're not going to take me to see anyone.

622
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
You want my phoenix edict.

623
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,920
If you don't stay here, I'll return it to Mo Xiao.

624
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Who are you?

625
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Why do you have phoenix edict in your future?

626
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
So you're curious about this.

627
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
I have it when I'm born.

628
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
You have it when you're born?

629
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Impossible.

630
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
There won't be such a coincidence in the world.

631
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,920
Who are you?

632
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
I'm not as good as you.

633
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Don't make me feel bad.

634
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
Or I'll hurt you.

635
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
You're in a deep thought.

636
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
But you're with Mo Xiao.

637
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,920
You can't leave without telling me.

638
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
I'm with Mo Xiao.

639
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Let me go.

640
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Or I'll hurt you.

641
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Don't blame me.

642
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
You're with Mo Xiao.

643
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
You can't hurt me.

644
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Tell me.

645
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Who are you?

646
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Let me go.

647
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Take her away.

648
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Let me go.

649
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,920
WWI

650
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,920
I dare your kin stop me today.

651
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
You're still suspecting me?

652
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
No, Miss.

653
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Po Yun is just a woman named Wu Chen.

654
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,920
She has the same style of seal with Miss.

655
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
And...

656
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,920
And she has a white and orange-colored sigh inside her body.

657
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Yes.

658
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,920
So you suspect that my identity is fake.

659
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
She is your Miss Feng Lixue.

660
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Miss, please calm down.

661
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
I just think that

662
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
when time is so precious,

663
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
there shouldn't be such a coincidence.

664
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,920
Po Yun is afraid that someone might take Miss's identity.

665
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
That's why she's here.

666
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
She's gone to the forum.

667
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
What about the result?

668
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
The result?

669
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Remember.

670
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,920
There's only one Feng Lixue in this world.

671
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
That's me.

672
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,920
And the Wu Chen by Mo Xiao's side,

673
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,920
the only value he has is that he helps me kill Mo Xiao.

674
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Miss, is he also a part of your plan?

675
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
You just need to remember.

676
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Our goal is to avenge my father.

677
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
I understand.

678
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Mo Xiao has set up a barrier in Wan Dao Ice Lake.

679
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Can't we see him?

680
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,920
That Feng Lixue is the daughter of the Heavenly Lord.

681
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,920
She has a grudge against Feng Yue's brother.

682
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Even if we can't defeat Mo Xiao,

683
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
that Feng Lixue won't let her save her.

684
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
That's right.

685
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,920
The important thing is that we can help Feng Lixue.

686
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Look.

687
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Did you find it?

688
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I think she must have gone a long way.

689
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Let's go and find her.

690
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Isn't this the girl by Mo Xiao's side?

691
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
The chance is coming so soon.

692
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Who is it?

693
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
The Wu Chen by the Yu Jiu.

694
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Open the barrier.

695
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
The Wu Chen by the Yu Jiu.

696
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
You're awake.

697
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Feng Xing Mianju?

698
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
You're Feng Mianyu?

699
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
You really don't remember me at all?

700
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Of course I do.

701
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
We met in Fengdu City.

702
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Where are we?

703
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
What are you doing?

704
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
You asked me what I was doing.

705
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
What am I doing?

706
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I told her that I shouldn't let you live.

707
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Even your enemies don't remember you.

708
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
You don't deserve to live in this world.

709
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
When did she move her feet?

710
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

711
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
It's because you don't understand.

712
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
That's why you don't deserve to be Feng Lixue.

713
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
You should die with Mo Xiao.

714
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
I'll kill Mo Xiao first.

715
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
If you kill Mo Xiao,

716
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
I won't let you get the chance.

717
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
I won't let you hurt her.

718
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
If I can't hurt you,

719
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
I won't believe that I can't hurt you.

720
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Feng Xing Mianju, you have it too.

721
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
I've warned you.

722
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Don't ruin her plan.

723
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
If you dare to touch her again,

724
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I'll make you disappear forever.

725
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,920
Do what you should do.

726
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
Don't touch her.

727
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

728
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,920
I'll kill you.

729
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,920
I'll kill you.

730
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
I'll kill you.

731
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
I'll kill you.

732
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
I'll kill you.

733
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
I'll kill you.

734
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
I'll kill you.

735
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
I'll kill you.

736
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
I'll kill you.

737
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
I'll kill you.

738
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
I'll kill you.

739
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
I'll kill you.

740
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,920
I'll kill you.

741
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,920
I'll kill you.

742
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
I'll kill you.

743
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
I'll kill you.

744
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
I'll kill you.

745
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,920
I'll kill you.

746
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,920
I'll kill you.
