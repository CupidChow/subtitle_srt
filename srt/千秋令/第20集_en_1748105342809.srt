1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Inferno

2
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,260
The moon in the sky, the hard part of the moon in the earth

3
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,860
Always have a dream, a foggy fog, a wave, a storm, a river, a river

4
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,660
A flower that flows, a water that has no shadow

5
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,060
The flowers of life, like a dream, like you

6
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,260
Always keep the toilets cleaned, no regrets

7
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,340
A unstoppable history, another life

8
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:40,480
The school yearning is also waiting for you

9
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,020
Uncle's Tickling

10
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,820
Episode 5

11
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,780
To Tickle the Green Book in Most Won't you

12
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,780
Isn't that the old Chang with the attack demon?

13
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,780
There is no way to break the law.

14
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,780
We are trapped here.

15
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Who can go to Su Yushan and break the Su Yuting?

16
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,780
Master Zhang,

17
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,780
I'd like to go to Su Yushan and break the Su Yuting.

18
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Master,

19
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
I'll go too.

20
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,780
I'll go too.

21
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,780
Qing'er, don't make trouble.

22
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Stay here.

23
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,780
Qing'er, stay here.

24
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Why can't I go?

25
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
Qing'er.

26
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
I'll go.

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,780
I'll go.

28
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,780
Don't make trouble.

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
This is a unique painting.

30
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,780
The magic force is extraordinary.

31
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
With my years of cultivation,

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
I can protect myself.

33
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,780
You are all

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
very difficult to protect yourself

35
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,780
when you are on the road.

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,780
I came here mainly to see

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,780
the situation here.

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Seeing that everyone is safe and sound,

39
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
it means you all did well.

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Very well.

41
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
You don't have to worry

42
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,780
about breaking the Su Yuting's law.

43
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
You only need to protect this place.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
You can't make any mistakes again.

45
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,780
Okay.

46
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Wait for my news.

47
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Senior Mo Ren,

48
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,780
did you tell us

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780
all the martial arts class?

50
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
The transmission has passed.

51
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,780
They received the seal of the seal.

52
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
They will return to the capital soon.

53
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,780
They won't go to Aiyu Valley anymore.

54
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780
That's good.

55
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Now we wait for Senior Mo Ren

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,780
to discuss

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
the way to get the seal.

58
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,780
Senior Mo Ren has been away for so long.

59
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Why hasn't he come back yet?

60
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,780
Yes.

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
Could it be

62
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
something wrong with Aiyu Valley?

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
This is so ridiculous.

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
I don't think so.

65
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
If there is a problem,

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
I will definitely send a message to him.

67
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Master.

68
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
Master.

69
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
The young master is here to see you.

70
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
Master.

71
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Master.

72
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
The painting shop of the Valley of Poison

73
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
is the center of the Demon Sect.

74
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,780
It needs to be broken by Su Yuting to be able to solve it.

75
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
I will go to Su Yushan.

76
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
Wait for my news.

77
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
Mo Xiao went to Su Yushan?

78
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
It seems that

79
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,780
the Poison Sect is indeed the painting shop of the Valley of Poison.

80
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
Mo Xiao must have received the message

81
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,780
from his Pu Gongying Flower Wolf.

82
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
He also went to Su Yushan.

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,780
Also went?

84
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
What else did he go?

85
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,780
Senior Zhang Mei hasn't come back for so long.

86
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,780
He must have confirmed

87
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,780
the origin of the Poison Sect.

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,780
He went to Su Yushan himself.

89
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,780
My Master.

90
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,780
My Master.

91
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,780
Maybe the person who stole the Poison's body

92
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
has something to do with this magic power.

93
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
If Mo Xiao's painting is true,

94
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,780
you are my enemy.

95
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Master.

96
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
Speak.

97
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
Master.

98
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,780
Someone broke into Su Yushan.

99
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,780
Someone who is so bold

100
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,780
should be the heir of Feng Yue.

101
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
That's Mo Xiao.

102
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,780
Li Xun.

103
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Aiyu Valley.

104
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,780
You have let your master down.

105
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
This time,

106
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
he came here on his own.

107
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
My Li Xue

108
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
shouldn't have let me down, right?

109
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
Okay.

110
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,780
I'll go get him now.

111
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
Okay.

112
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,780
I'll wait for your good news here.

113
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
But I have something to ask.

114
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,780
Yes, Master.

115
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
My Lady.

116
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
The Queen of Shanghao has invited Mo Xiao to the Mo Xiao.

117
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,780
She is the one who sent him to the Mo Xiao.

118
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,780
I'm afraid

119
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,780
she doesn't need to be afraid.

120
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
My Lady.

121
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
My Lady.

122
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
My Lady.

123
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
What's wrong?

124
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,780
I'm so anxious.

125
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,780
Tian Xin just heard the noise outside.

126
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,780
So she heard a voice.

127
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
The guards said

128
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
someone broke into Su Yushan.

129
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Someone broke into Su Yushan

130
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,780
and went to the Wu Xiang Palace to meet him.

131
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Why are you following me?

132
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
The one who broke into the mountain is...

133
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
He is the Mo Xiao of the Young Master of Su Mountain.

134
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,780
Who are you talking about?

135
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,780
The Young Master of Su Mountain.

136
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,780
Mo Xiao.

137
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,780
Feng Yu's descendant of the Sword Lord.

138
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Exactly.

139
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
He came here on his own.

140
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,780
The revenge of the killing man.

141
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,780
It's over.

142
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Lin Xue.

143
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
Mo Xiao.

144
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,780
How dare you break into Su Yushan?

145
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
You don't want to live anymore?

146
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
To protect the companion of Aiyu Valley.

147
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
I have to.

148
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
Aiyu Valley?

149
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Didn't you save them all?

150
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
But Chong Guang didn't want them to be better.

151
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
He even let the Demon Sect's main hall, Di Yuan, and Hua Valley go.

152
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,780
He is the one who saved them.

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,780
He is the one who saved them.

154
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,780
He is the one who saved them.

155
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
He is the one who saved them.

156
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
He is the one who saved them.

157
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,780
He is the one who saved them.

158
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780
He is the one who saved them.

159
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,780
He is the one who saved them.

160
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,780
He is the one who saved them.

161
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,780
He wants everyone to die in Aiyu Valley.

162
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Even so,

163
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
this is not the place you should come.

164
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,780
I will take you with me.

165
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Wait for me.

166
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,780
Mo Xiao.

167
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
Master.

168
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
The person from Chong Shan is Mo Xiao.

169
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,780
He was kidnapped by the Demon Lord.

170
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
The main hall of the Demon Lord has been arrested.

171
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,780
We...

172
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
We dare not act recklessly to the Demon Lord.

173
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
We are here to return to the Lord.

174
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,780
Are you sure?

175
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
Yes.

176
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
I can see clearly.

177
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,780
The dead dragon that the Xu Yuan has not seen for many years

178
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
has been out of the cave today.

179
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Xu Yuan is innocent.

180
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Xu Yuan is innocent.

181
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,780
You can't kill him.

182
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Master.

183
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Mo Xiao is important to you.

184
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Xu Yuan is innocent.

185
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,780
He must be doing something bad to the Demon Lord.

186
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Master.

187
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Do you want me to go to the Demon Lord's Palace?

188
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
No need.

189
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Xu Yuan is innocent.

190
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,780
He can't kill him.

191
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Then, Li Xue, please.

192
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Li Xue is my man.

193
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
He dares not act recklessly.

194
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
Talking about pilgrimage.

195
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,300
The Auction of the Demon Lord Nãoshe

196
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,500
I'm here to find you.

197
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,700
It seems that Feng Yue's Master

198
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,340
knows that I'm here to find you.

199
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,820
I've told you before.

200
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,380
It's a pity that you're not willing to seek revenge.

201
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,700
But Mo Xiao is very lucky today.

202
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,860
Can you wait for me to finish the key?

203
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,220
And then come to see Master

204
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,620
and settle the grudge against me.

205
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,380
I've waited for 18 years for the revenge of the killer.

206
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,940
Feng Yue's Master isn't here.

207
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,860
Feng Yue's Master's messenger is right in front of me.

208
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,980
You still want me to wait?

209
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,220
No.

210
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,500
I don't want to wait any longer.

211
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,860
Today, I'll use your blood

212
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,420
to kill my father.

213
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
It's okay.

214
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,820
Young Master Hao,

215
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,460
how dare you break into my Apothecary Palace?

216
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,940
Didn't Chong Guang tell you that

217
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,980
the whole Suyu Mountain

218
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,940
is the only Apothecary Palace

219
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,420
where Chong Guang can't be involved?

220
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,300
I don't know the rules of Suyu Mountain.

221
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,220
But Mo Xiao is the one I want to take away.

222
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,980
The new master of Xu Yuan is taking away.

223
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,020
What's the reason?

224
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,020
The reason?

225
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,100
You've been here for a few days

226
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,460
and you're talking about the reason.

227
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,860
Do you know that I have

228
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,260
the hatred of the killer and the son of the killer

229
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,420
because of Feng Yue's Master?

230
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,980
Today,

231
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,380
I'll take Chong Guang's side

232
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,500
and not argue with you.

233
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,420
Please get out of my Apothecary Palace right now!

234
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,780
Lin Xuan,

235
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,580
go back now!

236
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,740
If I take her away today,

237
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,220
don't blame me.

238
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,060
You'll be thrown into the Apothecary Palace together.

239
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,700
You'll be thrown into the Apothecary Palace for my dead body.

240
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,020
Then I'll see if I should die

241
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,380
in the Apothecary Palace.

242
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
The Apothecary Palace

243
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,060
Episode 1

244
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,860
Master,

245
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,500
speak.

246
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,740
Xu Yuan Wushuang wants to kill Mo Xiao.

247
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,260
Lin Xuan and the new master are also tied together.

248
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,100
Master!

249
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
Master, what's wrong with you?

250
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,340
Please be kind to me.

251
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,260
Lin Xuan.

252
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,180
Feng Lin Xuan,

253
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,380
I didn't want to catch you today.

254
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
But you

255
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,180
came here secretly.

256
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,540
Don't blame me for being rude.

257
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,700
Mother, you can't do that.

258
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,220
Mother, please forgive me.

259
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,300
Last time,

260
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,940
I didn't even make a decision

261
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,020
for her.

262
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,940
Today,

263
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,940
you just met Mo Yu in front of me,

264
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,860
yet you didn't ask for her permission.

265
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,740
Xu Yuan Wushuang,

266
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,940
what kind of identity do you have?

267
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,260
How did you come back?

268
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,860
I gave her the order of my mother.

269
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,460
If it weren't for my mother's help,

270
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,740
I would have died long ago.

271
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,980
But mother,

272
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
Lin Xuan is my only friend on the mountain.

273
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,820
She didn't hurt my mother.

274
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,140
Please let her go.

275
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,780
Master Xu Yuan!

276
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,700
Master Xu Yuan,

277
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,980
please calm down.

278
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
Master Xu Yuan,

279
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,660
we can't do anything rashly.

280
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,820
Feng Yue Jiancun

281
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,540
killed some demons.

282
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,420
We are the enemies of the demons.

283
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,260
Master Xu Yuan,

284
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,100
you are willing to help the demons.

285
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,940
But Feng Lin Xue is the love of the demons.

286
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,340
You are too much.

287
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,180
How can you tell me

288
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,700
what you want from the demons?

289
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,700
I just don't want to.

290
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,060
What can I do if the demons are here?

291
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,660
Master Xu Yuan,

292
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,180
you have been with her for so many years.

293
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,820
Why are you so close to her today?

294
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,380
You are a great man

295
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,540
for the demons.

296
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,740
But after that,

297
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,460
you and I have been together

298
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,660
for so many years.

299
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,700
For what?

300
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,580
Yes.

301
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,540
I am sorry.

302
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,820
But I still can't find her.

303
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,580
If she still doesn't find her,

304
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,980
she must be

305
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,980
the young girl

306
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,620
who can kill the demons.

307
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,500
That's why I hate you.

308
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,500
The enemy of the demons

309
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,580
is right in front of me.

310
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,660
But my child

311
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,820
is still alive.

312
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,740
You let me be a demon.

313
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,580
Tell me.

314
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,300
How can I be a demon?

315
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,460
Xu Yuan,

316
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,000
please have a rest

317
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,540
and escape from me.

318
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,780
Master,

319
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,060
please don't settle down.

320
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,020
Fine.

321
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,660
We will recover

322
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,620
Xun ENapp newly sent month of Las Chrones.

323
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,740
Go, Xia Yue,

324
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,060
or perårism.

325
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
I can't help you.

326
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,100
Why?

327
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,740
Spinning down.

328
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,340
Drink some water.

329
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,440
Stop it.

330
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,140
Ling Of Leona

331
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,340
Qing'er

332
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,020
Ling Xun

333
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Go!

334
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,260
You go in first.

335
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Have a good rest.

336
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
Go.

337
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
Xin Er.

338
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
I've hit you.

339
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
Are you all right?

340
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,220
I'm fine.

341
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
We should be careful.

342
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
No one has hit us.

343
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
Yes.

344
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,020
I'll go there and have a look.

345
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Okay.

346
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
Don't worry.

347
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,020
Why are you here?

348
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,020
I'm a little bit anxious.

349
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,420
I want to go to the convenience store.

350
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
What's this?

351
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,020
Isn't this a handkerchief?

352
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Are you going to send me?

353
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,020
Why are you sending me a handkerchief?

354
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Don't you think you have a lot of time?

355
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,020
You want to show me the way, right?

356
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,020
Come on.

357
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,020
It's a good idea.

358
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,020
I'll go there.

359
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,020
I'll go there.

360
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,020
I'll go there.

361
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,020
I'll go there.

362
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,020
I'll go there.

363
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,020
I'll go there.

364
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,020
I'll go there.

365
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,020
I'll go there.

366
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,020
I'll go there.

367
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,020
I'll go there.

368
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,020
Can you come here in a serious manner?

369
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,020
This is a jade seal.

370
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,620
This is a jade seal?

371
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,420
Yes.

372
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,020
It's the jade seal that can be used in the legend.

373
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,820
But this is too small.

374
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,020
It can only cover the nose.

375
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
It's useless.

376
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,220
It can even become bigger.

377
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,220
Let's go.

378
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,220
Don't talk nonsense.

379
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,020
Where are we going?

380
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,820
Don't you want to go to Su Yushan and drink a little bit of Su?

381
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,820
We are really lucky.

382
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,820
You know what I'm thinking.

383
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,820
Take it.

384
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,420
Why do you have another one?

385
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,820
How many are there?

386
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,820
Two.

387
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,420
One for me and one for my brother.

388
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,420
I'll steal it.

389
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,020
Since both of you have jade seal,

390
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
why do you still have to keep it in the storage?

391
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
You should have left earlier.

392
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,820
Is the girl from Mu Rong's family

393
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,420
so greedy and afraid of death?

394
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,220
Don't talk nonsense.

395
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,220
Let's go.

396
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,020
Let's go.

397
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,220
Chonggong?

398
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,220
How dare you break into my Yoling Palace?

399
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,220
Why not?

400
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
Chonggong,

401
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,620
Ye Yuan has a grudge against you.

402
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Now the enemy who killed him is right in front of you.

403
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,420
You don't want to avenge him?

404
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,020
Do you still want to stop me?

405
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,220
If you want to avenge me, I won't stop you.

406
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,620
But Feng Lixue is my disciple.

407
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,020
If you dare hurt him,

408
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,820
don't blame me for being rude to you.

409
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,420
Okay.

410
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,820
Today,

411
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,820
I'll kill Mo Xiao.

412
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,620
Yushan.

413
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,980
You may come here to follow my business.

414
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Do you know who was Road mee?

415
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
King Yushan!

416
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
King Yushan,

417
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,620
Yushan.

418
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,580
們

419
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,220
Fire.

420
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,220
Water.

421
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,340
Water!

422
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,940
I remember there was a cliff in the west side of Suyu Mountain.

423
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,740
There was no hand-holding.

424
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,540
That means if we were to break into Suyu Mountain,

425
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,740
the top of the cliff would be the most stable.

426
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,340
You dare to steal the map of the magical base?

427
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
You even stole the map of our Feng Yun Sect?

428
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,740
I'll go back and tell my dad.

429
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
This is not important now.

430
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,340
What matters is whether your map is real or not.

431
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,740
We've been looking for it for a long time.

432
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,540
We haven't seen any cliff.

433
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,740
The map of the magical base is just the magical base

434
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,140
that I, Feng Yun Sect, have sent all the information.

435
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,340
I'm afraid that your brain is broken and you remember it wrongly.

436
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,340
It's none of our business.

437
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,940
Since I have no problem with my brain,

438
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,340
your map is also real.

439
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,740
That means you must be in the front.

440
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,140
Let's go.

441
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,740
Xu Yan Xingzhu.

442
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740
There's still something important to do today.

443
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,140
We'll settle it down as soon as possible.

444
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,740
If we wait like this,

445
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,340
won't we die here?

446
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
The disciples of the Shushan Sect

447
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,340
can't we do anything to the magical base?

448
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,940
The disciples of the Shushan Sect

449
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,340
have different laws.

450
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
If we don't eat or drink here,

451
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
we'll have no problem for the next ten days and a half.

452
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,740
If we wait like this,

453
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,340
we'll just die.

454
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,340
That's right.

455
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
That's right.

456
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
It's here.

457
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,340
Are you going to climb up?

458
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,340
What if not?

459
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,340
There are still many ways to go up.

460
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Aren't you the best jade emperor?

461
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
How about making a jade emperor bird?

462
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
You don't understand that, right?

463
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,340
You're not a jade emperor.

464
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,340
You're a jade emperor.

465
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
You don't understand that, right?

466
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,340
This is the most important place

467
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,340
in the old court of the Shushan Sect,

468
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
the most ancient and most important place in the Shushan Sect.

469
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,340
The spiritual power of the Shushan Sect

470
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,340
must be sufficient in this place.

471
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,340
All right.

472
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
We can only climb up.

473
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
What are you doing?

474
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Prepare to climb up.

475
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
You don't need to climb up.

476
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
You can just stand here.

477
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
I've fallen here with you.

478
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
Why can't I go up?

479
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,340
You have to give me the battle point and guide me.

480
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
If I climb up to half of it,

481
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
and meet the magic soldiers of the patrol,

482
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
and get me a jade emperor bird,

483
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
it'll be awkward to climb up.

484
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
But...

485
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
you're going alone.

486
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
I'm not worried.

487
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
If you want to go up with me,

488
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,340
I'm more worried.

489
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,340
All right, Jing'er.

490
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
Be good.

491
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,340
You can stand here and guide me.

492
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,340
I'll take the risk.

493
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
Come on.

494
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Who's there?

495
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
Jing'er.

496
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Why are you here?

497
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,340
I saw you coming up alone.

498
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,340
I followed you up quietly.

499
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340
But I'm afraid of the moon and the sky.

500
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
I'm a little scared.

501
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,340
I'm here.

502
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,340
When we're in the palace,

503
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
we'll marry you.

504
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
I'm afraid of the moon and the sky.

505
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,340
Let's save our lives first.

506
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
All right.

507
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,340
Come on.

508
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,340
Jing'er, give me your strength.

509
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
Jing'er, don't be silly.

510
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
We're here.

511
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
You're...

512
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,340
I...

513
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
I'm here.

514
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
You're back.

515
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
You're back.

516
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
Close up the door.

517
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
Ensign.

518
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,340
I'll go down there.

519
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
Next door.

520
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
You may leave.

521
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,340
Yes.

522
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,340
Follow me.

523
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,340
After you.

524
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Follow me.

525
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,740
You tried to get rid of thedesident from Xia' Grant's Joanna Laru's labor,

526
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,920
so you have been exhausted by Hua Chenyu.

527
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,340
You Versed my brother to Wang Liang's memento.

528
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,580
You saw demands.

529
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,200
Does everyone know how Lu Xiao Mo feels?

530
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,420
Let's go.

531
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,240
淉em dato.

532
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
I won't tell you even if you kill me.

533
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Okay. Then you guys stay here.

534
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,580
What are you doing? Who are you?

535
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,580
If you want to live, you can stay here and don't make trouble.

536
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,580
Of course, you can't get out.

537
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,580
Someone will send you guys a gift on the 30th day.

538
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Who are you?

539
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,580
What should we do? We haven't found the ancestral hall yet.

540
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
Don't be trapped in this maze.

541
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Don't you think this person is weird?

542
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,580
He didn't kill us. He locked us up.

543
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Don't mind him. What about the people in Aiyu Valley?

544
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,580
So we have to find a way to escape.

545
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,580
Aiyu Valley

546
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Mo Xiao is here. Why isn't Chong Guang moving?

547
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,580
Aiyu Valley

548
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,580
You really came?

549
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
The valley is a unique place.

550
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Only if you push the vertical roof of the Suyu Mountain, you can get there.

551
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
I have to come.

552
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Do you think where is the Suyu Mountain?

553
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,580
If you want to come, you can.

554
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,580
If you didn't...

555
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
As the chief of the Mount Zu,

556
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,580
the disciples of the Fire Sect are both righteous and righteous.

557
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,580
I, Yuan Beichen, would like to die.

558
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Yuan Beichen, although your sword is not as sharp as the world,

559
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
this is the Suyu Mountain.

560
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,580
You are not the enemy of Chong Guang.

561
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
Aren't you afraid of death?

562
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,580
If I die like this,

563
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,580
it's a dead end.

564
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,580
If you beg me now, I may help you.

565
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,580
The disciples of the Immortal Sect are willing to die.

566
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Why do you think I won't stop you?

567
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,580
You?

568
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,580
You can't stop me?

569
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,580
Don't you think you have a half point to save me?

570
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,580
You were the one who sent the chief to me.

571
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I changed.

572
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,580
I was born to the world.

573
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,580
You are not worthy of being born.

574
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,580
I am not worthy of being born.

575
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,580
I am not worthy of being born.

576
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,580
I am not worthy of being born.

577
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,580
I am not worthy of being born.

578
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,580
I am not worthy of being born.

579
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I am not worthy of being born.

580
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,580
I am not worthy of being born.

581
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,580
I am not worthy of being born.

582
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,580
I am not worthy of being born.

583
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,580
I am not worthy of being born.

584
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,580
I am not worthy of being born.

585
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,580
I am not worthy of being born.

586
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Su Yiding.

587
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,580
What?

588
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
Su Yiding.

589
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
What's that sound?

590
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
What sound?

591
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Su Yiding.

592
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Is it the demon beast in the demon sect?

593
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,580
I feel like something fell down in the noon.

594
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Su Yiding?

595
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Su Yiding fell down.

596
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Su Yiding fell down? It's the demon beast.

597
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
He saved you for me.

598
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,580
Today, Wu Xiang Palace can't hear anything.

599
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,580
But he can't escape.

600
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,580
He is his own.

601
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
He can't escape from the demon beast.

602
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Stop.

603
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,580
I said that today, Wu Xiang Palace can't hear anything.

604
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Master, he saved me just now.

605
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
I will pay for this favor.

606
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
Mu Xiang, are you alright?

607
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,580
It's dangerous.

608
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Let's go.

609
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
I'll take you out.

610
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Let's go.

611
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,580
I...

612
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,580
Husband, broken.

613
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,080
Husband, broken.

614
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Instead of him...

615
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm so jealous of you.

616
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Really?

617
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Yes.

618
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
I stole my jade seal.

619
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
I hope you can be safe.

620
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
What's wrong?

621
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Master, someone just entered the ancestral hall.

622
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Who dares to enter the temple?

623
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
The sect leader of Mount Zu,

624
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Feng Yue's Sword Master, Mo Xiao.

625
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Mo Xiao is in the ancestral hall.

626
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Why doesn't the sect leader of Xu Yuan

627
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
stop him?

628
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
If it's not because of Feng Nixue's misdeed,

629
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
he would have been buried in my house.

630
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
How could he let him enter my ancestral hall

631
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
and break into the sacred hall?

632
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
There is a Heavenly Demon Garden waiting for him.

633
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
Fine.

634
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
I'll let the sect leader of Xu Yuan

635
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
do it myself.

636
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
I can see the sect leader of Mount Zu

637
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
in person today.

638
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
The sect leader of Xu Yuan is so generous.

639
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
The sect leader of Xu Yuan

640
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
is going to miss the chance

641
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,080
to avenge the late Lord?

642
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Of course not.

643
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
The sky is clear.

644
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,080
The summer snow is waiting for us.

645
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,080
The mountains are round and round.

646
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,080
The sky is clear.

647
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,080
The sky is clear.

648
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,080
The young love can come.

649
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,080
The sea is so hard to read.

650
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,080
The sky is clear.

651
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,080
The stars are not far away.

652
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,080
The clouds are scattered.

653
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,080
The mountains are cold and cold.

654
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,080
The mountains are round and round.

655
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:57,080
The sky is clear.

656
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,080
The past is not good.

657
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,080
The past is like the past with you.

658
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,080
The two winds are cool.

659
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,080
The night is silent.

660
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:19,080
The sound of the flute is heard.
