1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the wind, they are warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the earth

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the fog rises

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows and the river flows

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The falling flowers and the flowing water are helpless

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers of life

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like a dream, like you

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A moment, a thousand years

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The history is not clear

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain of another life

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The snow in the snow is waiting for you

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Waiting for you

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The End

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 1

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Miss

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Miss

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Brother Ding Lang

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sister

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Brother

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Brother

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Brother

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hold your breath.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Li Xuan.

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
ً

43
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,400
Are you big brother?

44
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,540
As you wish.

45
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,820
Brother Da'er!

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,560
A spy.

47
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Meng Xiao

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,580
I noticed it was your old brother's full family.

49
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,920
But you just ignored it, and this all happened now!

50
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:21,580
Morning,

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
the magic ring that was activated by the spirit.

52
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,320
I think it was Mo Xiao's

53
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
spirit power that was severely damaged

54
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,560
and he went back first.

55
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
You're right.

56
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,640
Let's go back now.

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
Do you know

58
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,280
the magic knife almost destroyed the sky lantern last night?

59
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
The girl in Tianxing Manor

60
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,240
helped the chief of Mount Zu

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,520
to push the magic knife.

62
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
When he was in the magic circle,

64
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,760
he used his body to block the magic.

65
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,240
It seems

66
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,120
he really didn't follow the magic knife.

67
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
He didn't follow the magic knife.

68
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,440
You two,

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,440
according to me,

70
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
we should see if the few

71
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,000
of the masters of Mount Zu can believe him.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
The girl has been lost since she was a child.

73
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
She was raised by the devil.

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
She was used by the spirit.

75
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
Now she's grown up and she's

76
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
full of energy.

77
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,040
She's very emotional.

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm sure the masters of Mount Zu

79
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
won't understand her.

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,120
Yes.

81
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
They finally believe Lin Xue.

82
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,240
It's not easy for them to believe her.

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,440
They're destined to be together.

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,720
What's wrong?

85
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,440
I think someone is following us.

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,840
No.

87
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,680
Forget it.

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,520
Let's go.

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,120
I just need to confirm

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,680
if you have Tianmuye.

91
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
I wonder if you're my brother.

92
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,580
ταสำค ker

93
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,320
He put a table in the drawer.

94
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Let's grow the tree back together.

95
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,280
manuan

96
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,520
No, God,

97
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,800
I didn't get it.

98
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Who are you?

99
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,840
You have no eyes?

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,480
I am really in a hurry.

101
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,240
Young Master, are you really okay?

102
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm fine.

103
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
How are you?

104
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,280
I didn't hurt you

105
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,480
because of your body.

106
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm fine.

107
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,640
I hope you can be safe.

108
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,560
It's okay.

109
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,040
Jian'er, let's go.

110
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,800
•

111
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,320
lassen

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,600
followed

113
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,640
by

114
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
the head of the fitting room

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
versión

116
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,400
No stain on her body

117
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
what happened

118
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,200
Was she sealed off on the door

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,360
She listened to local attire

120
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
determined to attack the capital

121
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Fortunately, the gate of the factory has been closed.

122
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
It's a big loss for the people.

123
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Yes.

124
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Fortunately, Mo Xiao was prepared in advance

125
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
and made the defense.

126
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
That's why he was safe and sound.

127
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
He saved the people in Fengdu City.

128
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Why didn't you see him?

129
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Last night, he fought with the seven-leafed wine.

130
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
He lost a lot of his spiritual power.

131
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
After taking the test,

132
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
the junior of Xuanzhen has been there.

133
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
He's fine.

134
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,120
He's resting in the Heaven's Garden.

135
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
That's good.

136
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,120
I've never heard of this.

137
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
I think the senior of the gate of the factory

138
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,120
has been in Fengdu City for the people of Anfu.

139
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,120
The people of Anfu are one of them.

140
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Last night, the lights were off.

141
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
That's Mo Xiao's idea.

142
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
I didn't expect that the two senior officers

143
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
would be so smart.

144
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,120
This has been spread in Fengdu City.

145
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
The people are very busy.

146
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
They said that the daughter of Fengxing Tianzhi

147
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Feng Li Xue was in a hurry and blocked the power.

148
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
That's why the gate of Mo Xiao

149
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,120
has been destroyed.

150
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
That's Li Xue.

151
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Not only last night,

152
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,120
last time, the Demon City was also blocked by Li Xue

153
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
and caused the people to be killed

154
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
by the evil spirits.

155
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,120
You all misunderstood him.

156
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
All right, Jing'er.

157
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Don't misunderstand.

158
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
But there are indeed some people of my sect

159
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
who are in a fight.

160
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
I've checked it out.

161
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Someone else was in a panic.

162
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
The person who was in a panic caused the people to be killed.

163
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I don't want to clean up the spirit snake.

164
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
That's why I didn't mention Li Xue.

165
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Girl, what are you talking about?

166
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
What kind of person is in a panic?

167
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Why didn't I hear the chief mention it?

168
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
The chief is just suspecting that

169
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
the investigation is still going on.

170
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
If there is a result, I will tell the senior officers.

171
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
It's bad! It's bad!

172
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Chief!

173
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
What is it?

174
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
In the back of the gate of Mo Xiao,

175
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
we found the body of the junior brother of Shao Chu.

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
What?

177
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Master.

178
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
What's going on?

179
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Master, I woke up early today.

180
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
I saw the flower seeding and it was meaningful.

181
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
I looked carefully and found the body of the junior brother of Shao Chu.

182
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Did you find out the cause of death?

183
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
I don't know the cause of death.

184
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
But the injury of the senior brother of Shao Chu

185
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
seems to be caused by the Demon Palace.

186
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Demon Palace?

187
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Could it be that

188
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,120
the demon clan started to attack our disciples in Shushan?

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,120
It seems that we must find the third demon's whereabouts as soon as possible.

190
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
I don't know.

191
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,120
The disciples of Shushan were bewitched by the inside of the temple.

192
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
It's amazing!

193
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,120
The Ninth Demon of Qi Dong was defeated last night.

194
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
But the Demon School is still bright.

195
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
It won't be easy to repair it.

196
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
If we don't find the third demon's whereabouts,

197
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm afraid that it won't be able to stop.

198
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
The Immortal Sect is everywhere.

199
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
It's still hard to avoid the Demon School's maintenance.

200
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,120
The Immortal Sect is really passive.

201
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Instead of that,

202
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
we should stop the Demon School's thinking.

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Senior Brother Qing Xu, you mean that

204
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,120
we should start looking for the demon's whereabouts?

205
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Yes.

206
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
We should not sit and wait.

207
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Instead of that, we should

208
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
find the third demon's whereabouts and destroy it.

209
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Then, we can stop the Immortal Sect from re-enlightening

210
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,120
and re-re-re-repeat the Demon's whereabouts.

211
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Yes, Senior Brother.

212
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Since we're here,

213
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,120
we should not take the risk of re-enlightening.

214
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
But now, the Demon School can't find the demon's whereabouts.

215
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,120
How can we find the demon's whereabouts?

216
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
The Heavenly Formation Formation.

217
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
The Heavenly Formation Formation?

218
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Letting Li Xue go?

219
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Then, will that be too risky?

220
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,120
But Li Xue has already been dragged into the battle.

221
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
This Heavenly Formation Formation needs a Heavenly Formation to open.

222
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
In this way, we should return the Heavenly Formation to us.

223
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
If we do that,

224
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
we'll allow it to reopen the Heavenly Formation.

225
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Yuan Shou Suo, do you think this skill is feasible?

226
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
I agree.

227
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Master, everyone.

228
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
First, we need to ask this dangerous skill.

229
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
The Mount of Shushan should be the main force.

230
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Return the Heavenly Formation to Feng Li Xue.

231
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
The heart is broken.

232
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,120
The Heavenly Formation can be returned to Feng Li Xue.

233
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
It's just...

234
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
It's just the Heavenly Formation.

235
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
It's just that...

236
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
It's just that...

237
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,120
It's just that the Heavenly Formation must be opened in my Mount of Shushan.

238
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
This is the condition of Mount of Shushan.

239
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Good.

240
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Since this is the case,

241
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,120
then please send someone from Mount of Shushan to the Heavenly Formation.

242
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
We'll discuss this with Feng Li Xue.

243
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll go.

244
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
We'll go with Feng Li Xue.

245
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Why don't we go then?

246
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
The Mount of Shushan has agreed to return the Heavenly Formation to us?

247
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Yes.

248
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Brother Mo Xiao and Master Yuan agreed to it.

249
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
But there's still a condition in Mount of Shushan.

250
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Please tell me.

251
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,120
We hope that you can open the Heavenly Formation in Mount of Shushan

252
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
and find the third demon stone.

253
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Demon stone?

254
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
That's right.

255
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
You need to find the demon stone before you return to the light.

256
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,120
You need to completely break the wildness of the Heavenly Formation.

257
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Although the Heavenly Formation has the ability to look for the power of the Divine Heart,

258
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
but can you find the demon stone?

259
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
I can't be sure.

260
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
This is the best way we can do.

261
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Just do it.

262
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
No one will blame you for what happened.

263
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Okay.

264
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
I'll go to Mount of Shushan to open the Heavenly Formation.

265
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Okay.

266
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
We'll meet at Mount of Shushan in two days.

267
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
What are you thinking?

268
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
I'm thinking that

269
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Mo Xiao didn't go to Murong Temple to find the lover of the Ghost Room.

270
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
But he didn't find anything.

271
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Why don't we go there and have a look?

272
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Ghost Room?

273
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
We still have to return to Mount of Shushan to give orders.

274
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
You're the young master of the Fengyu Sect.

275
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
You can let the news go.

276
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
What if we find anything?

277
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
We'll see what Murong Temple will say.

278
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Xie Lingyun,

279
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
why are you fighting with my brother?

280
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Is it because you think that Mo Xiao and his brother are close?

281
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Is that wrong?

282
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
You just say that you won't go.

283
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Okay.

284
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Since you're here,

285
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
let's go and have a look.

286
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm going to the temple.

287
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
I'm going to the temple.

288
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
I'm going to the temple.

289
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm going to the temple.

290
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm going to the temple.

291
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I'm going to the temple.

292
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I'm going to the temple.

293
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I'm going to the temple.

294
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm going to the temple.

295
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
I'm going to the temple.

296
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
I'm going to the temple.

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
I'm going to the temple.

298
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
I'm going to the temple.

299
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm going to the temple.

300
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm going to the temple.

301
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
I'm going to the temple.

302
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
I'm going to the temple.

303
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
I'm going to the temple.

304
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm going to the temple.

305
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
I'm going to the temple.

306
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm going to the temple.

307
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm going to the temple.

308
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm going to the temple.

309
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm going to the temple.

310
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm going to the temple.

311
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:25,120
I'm going to the temple.

312
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm going to the temple.

313
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
You take care on the temple.

314
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
You take care on the temple.

315
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Do it.

316
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm going to the temple.

317
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm going to the temple.

318
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Why should I walk around the temple?

319
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Why?

320
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Why is this nice place?

321
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
It's nice to see you as the princess then.

322
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Why should I go to the temple?

323
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Why?

324
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,920
Why?

325
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
But nothing.

326
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
It seems that they have destroyed all the evidence.

327
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
We need to look carefully.

328
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Who is it?

329
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Who is it?

330
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I can't see clearly. He ran away.

331
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
There is indeed someone. They didn't leave.

332
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Ling Yun, we should go back first.

333
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,920
We need to discuss with Brother Mo Xiao.

334
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Okay. He ran away today.

335
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Let's just let him go.

336
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
We need to do something important. We should go back first.

337
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Brother Mo Xiao.

338
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Brother Mo Xiao.

339
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Jing.

340
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
What are you looking for?

341
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Nothing.

342
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,320
I didn't find anything.

343
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
What do you want?

344
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,240
I'll help you find it.

345
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
I... I'll go back first.

346
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,240
Jing'er.

347
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,680
What's wrong?

348
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
Did Xianling Yu bully you?

349
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,800
Brother.

350
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
I'm a little scared.

351
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,240
Scared?

352
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,240
What are you scared of?

353
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,280
What happened?

354
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,560
I just...

355
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,400
What happened just now?

356
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,440
Nothing.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,560
Brother.

358
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
Why are you here?

359
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm going to find something for my father.

360
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,440
I'll go back first.

361
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,080
Jing'er.

362
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,680
Do you have any problem?

363
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,680
No.

364
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,480
Yes.

365
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,960
Dad.

366
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,000
C such.

367
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,920
What's wrong with you today?

368
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,560
You and Jing'er colluded with me

369
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,540
and

370
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,140
and I is not going to clean it up.

371
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,520
You are so lucky.

372
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,320
Human beings are recorded everywhere in via media

373
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,200
Completely, no two job

374
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,320
Nobody, commander

375
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,200
Let me see

376
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,160
We should investigate

377
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,320
Anyone related to anything?

378
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,120
Anything?

379
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,260
This is the most mysterious organization in the pugilistic labeled world

380
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,300
They must learn to control and stay carefree

381
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,260
and his own benefactor.

382
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,740
From now on,

383
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,900
how do you think you can ask this?

384
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,260
I want to find a person.

385
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,860
Who?

386
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,580
A dead man?

387
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,340
But I don't know

388
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,340
what he really is.

389
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,620
These dead men

390
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,060
have never had any real

391
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,100
name or surname.

392
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,020
In their eyes,

393
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,740
only the name and their mission.

394
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Who is it?

395
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,620
Why?

396
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
In the capital city,

397
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,900
I saw a man who is like a shadow.

398
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,420
So I want to find out.

399
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,700
There will be a shadow in the capital city.

400
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,340
What did you find?

401
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,300
Not yet.

402
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,980
But I suspect that

403
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,140
the person behind him

404
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,260
is looking for the Demon Lord.

405
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
I hope that

406
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,620
there won't be any mistakes tomorrow.

407
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,220
Alright.

408
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Don't think too much.

409
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,780
Clean up.

410
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,340
Hurry.

411
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,060
Okay.

412
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,060
Master.

413
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,860
I shouldn't have disturbed you

414
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,060
if you were here.

415
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,380
But I just got the secret letter from the capital city.

416
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,260
Tomorrow,

417
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,020
I will change the sky seal to Feng Lixue.

418
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,500
The requirement is to let Feng Lixue

419
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,660
open the Sky Seal Formation in the capital city.

420
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,300
Feng Lixue has agreed.

421
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,060
Master.

422
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,540
If the third-ranked Xia Luo

423
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
is known by the capital city,

424
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,860
then our plan will be fulfilled.

425
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,900
Master.

426
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,380
Tomorrow,

427
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,620
I will open the Sky Seal Formation in the capital city.

428
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,860
Why do you have a plan?

429
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,060
Do you want to ask What's the purpose of your life?

430
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,580
You are headed by my example.

431
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,460
Are you still curious?

432
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,060
Coming.

433
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,980
Shen invested a lot to sneak to see

434
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,220
a number.

435
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,020
Stop thinking about it.

436
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,180
Hurry.

437
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,340
Let's go.

438
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,300
Come on.

439
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,660
Let's go inside.

440
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,100
Master.

441
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,700
Master.

442
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
I have already set up a barrier on the stage.

443
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
I was taken by Miss Li Xue to protect me.

444
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,700
At that time, only me and the chief of the gate and the master

445
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
can be like the disciples in the temple.

446
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,700
The other disciples are all kept in the outside of the temple.

447
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Mu Xiao,

448
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,700
if I take back the Tianxing Eagle today,

449
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I can return to the right path.

450
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,700
As you wish,

451
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,700
I can go back to the right path.

452
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,700
I can go back to the sun.

453
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
Mu Xiao.

454
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Mu Xiao.

455
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Mu Xiao.

456
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,700
Mu Xiao.

457
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Mu Xiao.

458
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Mu Xiao.

459
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
Mu Xiao.

460
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Mu Xiao.

461
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,700
Mu Xiao.

462
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Mu Xiao.

463
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Mu Xiao.

464
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
The master of the Tianxing Sect, Li Xue,

465
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,820
is composed in the ancient canvas multitaire.

466
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,540
I should thank for your kindness these years.

467
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:44,700
I should teach

468
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
I'm sorry.

469
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700

516
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
I'm sorry.

517
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm sorry.

518
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
I'm sorry.

520
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
I'm sorry.

521
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
What's going on?

522
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
Could it be that the Demon of the Xiu Long is in Mount Shu?

523
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,820
­

524
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,660
Let me be.

525
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,220
My Milkface Broker's

526
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,340
Li Xue.

527
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,020
我�过此时,

fly to SweetVery Tell.

530
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,880
Why are there no sparklers here?

531
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,980
What do you useful?

532
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,740
Nothing.

533
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,000
I think they are a little tired.

534
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,280
Let's paint the moon now.

535
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,200
But when heat sคed,

536
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,140
they wouldn't paint or shineervation.

537
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,460
In the Qing period all immediately

538
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,020
Protect crown prince's son

539
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,540
It's not that they've done nothing.

540
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,280
Even if they've done everything,

541
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:25,180
there are rooms of the

542
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,500

they've closed the secret door to keep um pioneer

544
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,180
【 tales of memory were left】

545
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,700
What's going on?

546
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,140
Leng QRun.

547
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,020
What good will you do?

548
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,340
Thank you.

549
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,140
Feng Li was so subconscious.

550
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,580
I should have killed you.

551
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,220
Back down.

552
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,300
Wait for misbehave.

553
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,820
Badaves.

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,620
Cui Yuan.

Zisu!

562
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,180
Wu Xiang!

563

Zisu!

565
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Changmen.

566
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Come here.

567
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
Zisu.

568
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Zisu.

569
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
I still need to find your soul powder.

570
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
Zisu.

571
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
Zisu!

572
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
No!

573
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
No.

574
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Wu Xiang.

575
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Zisu.

576
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Is the magic power in Mo Xiao?

577
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Mo Xiao!

578
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Mo Xiao has been devoured.

579
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Mo Xiao, why did you collude with the demon sect?

580
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
You forced three demons to devour you.

581
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
I didn't.

582
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
I didn't.

583
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
Don't talk nonsense.

584
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,180
It has nothing to do with this.

585
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
No.

586
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
I'm not a demon.

587
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
Go back home.

588
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
It's okay.

589
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,180
Let's go.

590
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,180
The End

591
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Get out of the way.

592
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Get out of the way.

593
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
Get out of the way.

594
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,180
Get out of the way.

595
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,180
If anyone stops me today, I'll kill anyone.

596
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,180
Where are you going?

597
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,180
Fengdu City.

598
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
The Heavenly Formation.

599
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,180
You forgot.

600
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
Your Heavenly Formation is about to be devoured.

601
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
You have to rebuild the Heavenly Formation.

602
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
You'll never be taken by the world.

603
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
That's impossible.

604
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Don't you understand?

605
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
There won't be any Heavenly Formation in this world.

606
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,180
I'll send you back to the Heavenly Formation.

607
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,180
I just want to help you

608
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
find the right pawn of the Demon Formation.

609
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Yi Xuan.

610
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Chong Guang.

611
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Thank you for your hard work.

612
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
I have a command.

613
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
From now on,

614
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
you can't leave this Mount Sui.

615
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,180
The whole Immortal Sect is in your hate now.

616
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,180
I'm afraid it's his sect.

617
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,180
And you're the one who killed all of this.

618
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
You!

619
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,180
You just woke up.

620
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,180
You're already so angry.

621
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Chong Guang!

622
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
What?

623
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,180
You don't even call your master now?

624
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,180
Let me go.

625
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
No.

626
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
You're not going anywhere.

627
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
You're just staying by my side.

628
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,180
You've done everything you want to do.

629
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
From now on,

630
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,180
you just have to stay by my side.

631
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,180
And enjoy the glory of being alone with you.

632
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,180
Why?

633
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,180
Why are you doing this to me?

634
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,180
Don't think about anything.

635
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,180
Everything will pass.

636
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,180
My master will make you feel better.

637
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,180
Master, he wants to kill you.

638
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,180
Why don't you let me send him to the Demon Realm?

639
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
Leave now.

640
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
How could this happen?

641
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,180
How could this happen?

642
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Master.

643
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
Young Master.

644
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,180
All Immortal Sect members are in the Demon Realm.

645
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
Please come with me.

646
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,180
Master.

647
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,180
How is the injury of the Sect Leader?

648
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,180
The most important thing is that

649
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,180
he's not injured.

650
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
Thank you, Master.

651
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
I can still visit the Sect Leader now.

652
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
Zi Feng.

653
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
I'm sorry.

654
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
I'm sorry.

655
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,180
I'm sorry.

656
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
I'm sorry.

660
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
I'm sorry.

661
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
Zi Feng.

662
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,180
Go get some

663
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
spiritual pills for him.

664
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
Because there's a difficult one

665
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
waiting for him behind.

666
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
Zi Su, bring them.

667
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,180
I... I'll go get them.

668
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
I'll go help you.

669
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Mu Xiao.

670
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,180
Why did you collude with the Demon Realm?

671
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,180
You stole three demons' stones.

672
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
Protect the disciples of Mount Shu!

673
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
Zi Su!

674
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,180
Protect the disciples of Mount Shu!

675
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,180
Zi Su!

676
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Mu Xiao.

677
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Kill him!

678
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Mu Xiao.

679
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
Mu Xiao.

680
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
Mu Xiao.

681
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Here you go again.

682
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Didn't I ask you

683
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
to get the spiritual pills?

684
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
Why did you bring them all?

685
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,860
These are all

686
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,860
from the Chief Zi Su.

687
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
I don't know which one,

688
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,180
so I got them all.

689
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
These are the spiritual pills

690
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,180
of the spiritual pills.

691
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,180
This is for raising the liver and protecting the heart.

692
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
This...

693
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,580
About Zisu's funeral,

694
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,580
Bai Cao Man will help him do it according to the rules of the door.

695
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,180
No, Uncle.

696
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:44,980
Zisu once said that his life is the happiest and happiest time

697
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,980
is when we grow up together in Xuan Qing courtyard.

698
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,380
I think that

699
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,180
the funeral in Xuan Qing courtyard is also his wish.

700
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,780
Please grant it.

701
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,180
Fine. Since it's Zisu's wish,

702
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,580
then let's just grant it.

703
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
Thank you, Uncle.

704
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,980
Teacher! Teacher!

705
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,380
The sect in the hall has formed a group.

706
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,980
All the sects and sects in front of the door are going to go through.

707
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,580
You tell them,

708
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,180
just do whatever they want.

709
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,580
I have never been interested in those bad things about them.

710
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,780
They said that the sects in the hall must go through.

711
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,580
They said that they want...

712
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
They want...

713
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,780
What do they want?

714
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,780
They want to ask the sect leader of Mount Zu.

715
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
The three great ancestors of mine,

716
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,980
always follow the sect.

717
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,580
They have been loyal to Mount Zu

718
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,180
and have led the sects to go through.

719
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,780
They have been loyal to the sects and sects.

720
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,180
Now,

721
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,180
even the sect leaders of Mount Zu have been devoured.

722
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,180
How can they still lead the sect?

723
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,980
That's right.

724
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,780
This time, Feng Li Xue has opened the Heavenly Formation Formation.

725
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,380
We have many advantages and disadvantages.

726
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,980
But we have the sect leader, Qing Yun,

727
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,780
who has given the Heavenly Formation seal to Feng Li Xue.

728
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
But I didn't think that

729
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,180
he actually survived the Demon Stone of the Xiu Luo.

730
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,580
And, in the capital city,

731
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,380
the sect leaders and Feng Li Xue

732
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,380
have been talking about the Demon Spirit for the disciples of each sect.

733
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,780
But they have killed many disciples of the sect.

734
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,180
Now, they are all trying to make people feel better.

735
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,980
Feng Li Xue has opened the Heavenly Formation Formation.

736
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,980
But you all have the same idea.

737
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,980
That's how the sect leaders will agree.

738
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,980
How come they have become his sins?

739
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,580
At the meeting of the Central Plains,

740
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,780
the sect leaders have already known that the Demon Sect will have a move

741
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,980
and will destroy the legal talks.

742
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,780
They have already ordered me to go to Yishan Road

743
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,380
and bring the Tiger Spirit Cloth.

744
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,180
This time, the sect leaders have already made the seal to the Mount of Shu.

745
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,180
If the sect leaders are really being destroyed by the Demon Girl,

746
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,580
why would they have to fight against the Demon Spirit Cloth?

747
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,780
They have the power to fight against the Demon Spirit Cloth.

748
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,980
You all have been in danger of seeking help from the Mount of Shu.

749
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,580
Now that the sect leaders are being hurt by the Demon Lord,

750
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,780
why don't you all gather the power of the sect leaders to seek help from the Mount of Shu?

751
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,780
