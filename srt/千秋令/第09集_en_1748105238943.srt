1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers fall and flowers bloom

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind blows and the moon is warm

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The moon in the water

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the world

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows and the moon blows

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows and the moon blows

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The wind blows and the moon blows

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers in the rain

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like dreams, like you

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've been careful not to be blind

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't get away from the history

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The rain in the other world

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll wait for you at home

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll wait for you

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Episode 1

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are so beautiful and beautiful

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Love can be separated

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Even she is waxed

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm willing to love

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But unfortunately

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't want you ever again

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Are swMANDDOP

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How disgusting

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,960
I have never accused a woman

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Be터�ina

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
You left the world

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
and learnedeDING

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,240
Of course not.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,120
There are many fun things in the Qing world.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,720
Then,

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,000
think about it for me.

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,840
How can I let Brother Mo Xiao take me there?

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,680
The painting room is fixed.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Get ready to set off.

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,760
I asked Zisu to make some glutinous rice balls.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
Put in the garden.

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,600
If you want to eat,

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,280
you can take it out.

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,840
I also asked Xie Lingyun to find a doctor

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
to help you cure the cold.

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,160
If you are ready,

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
I haven't come back yet.

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,520
You can stay in this heaven's garden

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,400
to rest and rest.

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,920
After I come back,

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
I will help you to keep your life after you go down the mountain.

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,960
I don't think you are in trouble.

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,080
It's just that the road ahead is dangerous.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,520
You can stay in the mountain.

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,960
It will be safer.

67
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,760
I'm leaving.

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,680
Wu Chen.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,280
Wu Chen.

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,880
Wu Yuanfox suddenly turned serious.

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,000
I was'm sorry for her.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,160
I knew she was playing角litch.

73
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,120
Why is it necessary?

74
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,680
What he said was true.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,440
She didn't lie to me.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240
Don't move.

77
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,680
She is behind all the slip.

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Don't turn around.

79
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
Dis Milliard in TIANガ

80
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,160
The Vince dust bun follows the shooting sky

81
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
You're kinda like a attractions

82
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,800
And your fragrance is inch andSH

83
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,460
burning

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,880
Especially when you fall

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,880
Wu Xiao

86
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,980
Thank you

87
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,680
青モ小

88
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Thank you for helping me to get up and get out of the cold.

89
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Thank you for protecting me.

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,680
But this is the first time I've ever understood the real world.

91
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,680
This is the first time I've ever tasted the hot soup.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,680
This is the first time I've ever tasted such delicious glutinous rice balls.

93
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:20,680
But is it really tiring for you to be like this?

94
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
I've always been in trouble with you.

95
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
In the past, you were the only one who lived.

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Because of you, you protected me, warmed me up and protected me.

97
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm very happy.

98
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,680
But if you don't like to do these things...

99
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Then you can do all these things in the future.

100
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,680
If that's the case, you're not my destiny.

101
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm leaving.

102
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Don't worry.

103
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,680
I've learned to be friends with people.

104
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm not the same as before.

105
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I've learned to read and read.

106
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I won't cause you any more trouble.

107
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I've never said you're my trouble.

108
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Wang Xiao.

109
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
I'll take you away.

110
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Go back.

111
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Yes.

112
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,680
I can't walk anymore.

113
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I'll carry you.

114
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Are you sure you want to carry me back?

115
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Yes.

116
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,680
I'm not going back.

117
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
I'm not here to support you.

118
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
I'm not here to support you.

119
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm not here to support you.

120
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
I'm not here to support you.

121
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Brother Mo Xiao.

122
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm telling you to stop thinking about Xiao.

123
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm afraid that I'll hurt her.

124
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
On the road to Wan Dao Ice Lake,

125
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
she's always in danger.

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
I'm afraid that if you two

127
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,680
have any problems on this road,

128
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,480
I...

129
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
If there's any problem, it's her.

130
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,680
I won't...

131
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I won't...

132
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I won't...

133
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
I won't...

134
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
I won't...

135
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
I won't...

136
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
I won't...

137
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I won't...

138
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
This time, you don't want to wear it.

139
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
What's that?

140
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,680
You mean you're going to wear it?

141
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Thank you, brother.

142
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,680
What's that? Hurry up and eat.

143
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
I got news.

144
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I received the return order just now.

145
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,680
What did he say?

146
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,680
He said he was going to Wan Dao Ice Lake recently.

147
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,680
He asked us to meet in the peach blossom room

148
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,680
at Wan Dao Ice Lake in half a month.

149
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
What does that mean?

150
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Mo Xiao asked me to find a doctor

151
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
to save Wuchen.

152
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
He just received the return letter of this doctor.

153
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,880
So...

154
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
So Wuchen is going to go with him?

155
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,880
I don't need to stay, right?

156
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
That's great. That's great.

157
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
He's going to Wan Dao Ice Lake recently.

158
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,480
He's always been a stranger.

159
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,880
Is he also attracted by the nature?

160
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,880
It seems that this is a big trouble.

161
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,880
We must not let it go.

162
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,480
Pack up.

163
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,480
Get ready.

164
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,280
Okay.

165
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,080
This is the heaven.

166
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,480
Alright.

167
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Let's take a look.

168
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,880
Wushan, come out.

169
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
What are you hiding from me?

170
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,880
Let us have a look.

171
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,480
Don't fall.

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
Why are you laughing?

173
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,680
It's the flower brush.

174
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
It's the same as the one you drew for me.

175
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm afraid you can't use these rouge.

176
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,680
But you look so cute.

177
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,080
Zisu,

178
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,920
draw a new makeup for Wushan.

179
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,920
Let's get started.

180
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,800
How is it?

181
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,680
I'm better, right?

182
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Jiang, you should draw one too.

183
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,880
This one is a bit too high.

184
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,360
Draw a little bit faster.

185
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,240
It's more convenient for us to act like this.

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
I'll just say it if you want to praise me.

187
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,200
I got it.

188
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
The

189
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,280
The

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,200
The

191
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,000
The

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,600
The

193
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,320
The

194
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,040
The

195
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,640
The

196
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,440
The

197
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
The

198
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
The

199
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,040
The

200
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,640
The

201
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,400
The

202
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,040
The

203
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,800
The

204
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,400
The

205
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
The

206
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
The

207
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
The

208
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
The

209
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
The

210
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
The

211
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
The

212
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
The

213
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
The

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
The

215
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
The

216
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
The

217
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
The

218
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
The

219
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
The

220
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
The

221
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
The

222
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
The

223
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,320
No.

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
A lid of Bite share!

225
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,360
Say it, baby.

226
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,280
This body fits you.

227
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,000
Me, too.

228
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,880
Jing, is this figure suitable?

229
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,500
It's time to go.

230
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,620
Prepare for the olmakation.

231
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
Yes.

232
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
Yes.

233
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,700
Be careful!

234
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,580
Brother Mo Xiao asked me to take care of your safety.

235
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,140
Don't cause me any trouble.

236
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,980
I know what happened.

237
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,260
Mo Xiao said that I wasn't in trouble.

238
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,740
It's my duty.

239
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
You're just in trouble.

240
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Young Master, the room is ready.

241
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
There are three rooms on the second floor.

242
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
You and the hostess Xie and Miss Murong

243
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
will meet with Miss Wuchen.

244
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Okay.

245
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
I don't want to meet with Wuchen.

246
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Why?

247
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
I'm not used to sleeping.

248
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
What if you get married?

249
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
What if you get married?

250
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
You're so ridiculous.

251
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
You're just being ignored.

252
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
You're afraid that people will know.

253
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
You have to take care of Miss Wuchen's safety.

254
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
It's easy to live together.

255
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
I sleep very well.

256
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
I can stay next door.

257
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,740
Moreover, we're all on this painting room.

258
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
This painting room is on the river bank.

259
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
What's the danger?

260
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
How about this?

261
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
I'll stay here.

262
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Wuchen will stay here.

263
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
Brother Mo Xiao,

264
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
please feel sorry for

265
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,740
meeting with Xie Lingyun.

266
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Okay?

267
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,740
No.

268
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
She's not sorry.

269
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,740
I can't say sorry.

271
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
You don't know how bored she is.

273
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
She has to sit down every day for 36 lessons.

274
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
She doesn't let people talk.

275
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
I want to sleep with her.

276
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
You want to make me bored?

277
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,740
You're not her brother Mo Xiao.

278
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,740
You're too stubborn.

279
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
If you don't believe me,

280
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
you can try it.

281
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Xie Lingyun, what are you talking about?

282
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
Okay.

283
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,740
You two, stop arguing.

284
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,740
I'll just stay with Mo Xiao.

285
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
What do you think?

286
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
How do we sleep?

287
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Of course, we sleep on the bed.

288
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
The bed is so soft.

289
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
It must be very comfortable to hug each other.

290
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Who are you going to hug?

291
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Hug you.

292
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
When I was in Mount of the Dead,

293
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
I hugged Xu'er and slept together.

294
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
It wasn't cold at all.

295
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
You're a three-year-old child.

296
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
You still hugged me and slept.

297
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Let me tell you.

298
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,740
I hate when people touch me the most when I sleep.

299
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
Don't touch me.

300
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Then,

301
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
I'll go to the bathroom.

302
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Then,

303
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
what do you think it is?

304
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
Hu Chen,

305
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
hurry up and go.

306
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
I understand now.

307
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,740
You didn't want me to hug you.

308
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,740
It's because you wanted to hug me.

309
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,740
Who wants to hug you?

310
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
He seems to have climbed over here.

311
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Hurry up and go.

312
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Hu Chen,

313
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
I can't.

314
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
I'm really scared.

315
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
Hurry up and go.

316
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Hurry up.

317
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
That's what you said.

318
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
You wanted to hug me.

319
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,740
Okay, okay.

320
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Hurry up and go.

321
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
I beg you.

322
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Then, let go of your hand.

323
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
I won't.

324
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Woman, woman.

325
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,340
If I don't pick her up anymore,

326
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,240
this gentleman doesn't really care about me.

327
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,740
I came here for Hu Chen's sake.

328
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,740
There was nothing wrong with the storing the sword bolehi.

329
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Do you really let him go?

330
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
Wu Chen was imprisoned in the Demon Palace that day.

331
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,900
When I was punished for the sword,

332
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,300
did the wound move?

333
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,700
Did any strangers come in?

334
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
No.

335
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,500
There was no movement.

336
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
Then who will bring the mask?

337
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Mask?

338
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
What mask?

339
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Nothing.

340
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Sect Leader,

341
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,740
I've done the wet-and-dry exercise you asked me to do.

342
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,740
What is this?

343
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,940
Is this your new magic?

344
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,020
This is the body guard I helped Wu Chen to beat.

345
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,220
Give it to him?

346
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,700
Why not give it to me?

347
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,740
You want to give this rope to me?

348
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,740
To prevent the wound from being used?

349
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
This is not a rope.

350
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740
This is called wet-and-dry exercise.

351
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740
It's a very powerful magic.

352
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
I'm Mo Xiang.

353
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
Look at her.

354
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,740
She has no foundation.

355
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
She gave her such a difficult magic.

356
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
She has no foundation.

357
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
You're so ungrateful.

358
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
I'm Mo Xiang.

359
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Look at her.

360
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
She has no foundation.

361
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
She gave her such a difficult magic.

362
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,740
You're so ungrateful.

363
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Do you really want to leave?

364
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
Jiang Er,

365
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
I made you a little gift.

366
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
What?

367
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Here.

368
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Don't run away.

369
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
I made you a yellow pearl.

370
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,740
Look,

371
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
it's so cute.

372
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
It's moving.

373
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Isn't it?

374
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,740
It's moving.

375
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
It's moving.

376
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
It's moving.

377
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
It's moving.

378
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,740
It's moving.

379
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
It's moving.

380
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
It's moving.

381
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
It's moving.

382
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
It's moving.

383
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,740
It's moving.

384
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
It's moving.

385
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
It's moving.

386
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Isn't it?

387
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
Come on, Jiang Er.

388
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Young Master.

389
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,740
It's not a toy for girls.

390
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
They all like cute animals.

391
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
Like cats, dogs,

392
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
birds.

393
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
It's not a toy for girls

394
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
that you can play with.

395
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
It's really not a toy.

396
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
You're so mean.

397
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,740
You know it.

398
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
Young Master.

399
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,740
Xie Ling Yuan,

400
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,740
don't bully me.

401
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
You bully me.

402
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
Zimu is my iron door.

403
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm his Young Master.

404
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
Zimu,

405
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
tell me who you are.

406
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
He's my man.

407
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Zimu,

408
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
I'm done.

409
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
You don't have to stay here.

410
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Go and see if Zifeng and Zisu

411
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
need any help.

412
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Yes.

413
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,740
You can't just get out.

414
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,740
You have to get out.

415
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
I didn't mean to.

416
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,740
Really?

417
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,740
They are weird.

418
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
They can't get used to it.

419
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
They're alone now.

420
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
Women

421
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
don't understand.

422
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Look at me.

423
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,740
Like this.

424
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,740
I've said it many times.

425
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
Why don't you understand?

426
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
One more time.

427
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
It's weird.

428
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,740
You're so generous.

429
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,740
You're not generous.

430
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Why did you

431
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
give me a wet wet wet?

432
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
It's hard.

433
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
You're not smart like me.

434
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
I think this chain is good.

435
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
It's suitable for a meal.

436
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
I know.

437
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,940
Do you

438
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,740
think this name

439
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,860
does

440
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,740
good things for away温?

441
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
I still want to get it.

442
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
But

443
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,740
my brother gave you this.

444
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
It's forамаienda.

445
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
I andwrote it

446
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,740
but it was used to beat them.

447
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,740
Fear which people

448
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,940
Are they good or bad?

449
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,060
What are you looking at?

450
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,540
Isn't that the master of the Biscayne?

451
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,980
And the master of the Changshou Valley?

452
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,220
Then who should we help

453
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,820
when they fight?

454
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,260
Right.

455
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,500
Who should we help?

456
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,540
What should we help?

457
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,460
Young people.

458
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,780
As an old man who has been walking for years,

459
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,300
I'll tell you my experience.

460
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,580
The best way to solve this problem is

461
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,980
to make me happy.

462
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
Make me happy?

463
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,940
With my experience,

464
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,220
you must be careful when you walk.

465
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,940
Don't make others fight

466
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,460
unless you are touched.

467
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,580
Mo Xiao.

468
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,340
Young people.

469
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,100
You are the young man of the Biscayne.

470
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,460
Sect Leader.

471
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,180
Who are you?

472
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,660
How dare you take the order from Feng Yu?

473
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,340
Xiao Zi.

474
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,820
You seem to be a righteous person.

475
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,780
Why are you so interested in the Heavenly Star?

476
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,700
Young Master.

477
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,740
You are the first-class.

478
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,700
You should not be the second-class.

479
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,660
Everyone.

480
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,460
I have the order from Feng Yu.

481
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,220
Please stop fighting.

482
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,820
What did they say?

483
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,500
They are arguing with us.

484
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,340
They said we are the best at the Heavenly Star.

485
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,220
We are the best at the Heavenly Star.

486
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,380
He is usually the most timid.

487
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,540
What's wrong with him today?

488
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,780
He is so pretentious.

489
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,460
What did they say?

490
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,660
What did they say to him?

491
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,980
They said we are the best at the Heavenly Star.

492
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,980
They said Mo Xiao is the best at the Heavenly Star.

493
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,660
Qing'er.

494
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,140
You are the best at the Heavenly Star.

495
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,620
You are so heartless.

496
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,660
You three.

497
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,580
Watch the whole city.

498
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,860
I will do it.

499
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,860
Young Master Xie will not be in trouble.

500
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,420
Mo Xie.

501
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,820
Bao Taoling.

502
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,540
Who are you?

503
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,020
I am the young master of the Iron Lv Gate,

504
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,380
Xie Lingyun.

505
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,100
Young Master Feng Yu.

506
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,180
Mu Rongjing.

507
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,740
You really want to

508
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
take this heat from the mountain?

509
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,380
I have the order from Feng Yu.

510
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,020
We can enter the Heavenly Star together with the women of Feng.

511
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,660
Please lead the way.

512
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,900
Please show your face and face.

513
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,020
You can do it.

514
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,540
Mo Xiao.

515
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,820
What are you doing?

516
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,740
Xiao Man.

517
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,420
Since you are a big boy,

518
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,180
I will accompany you.

519
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,100
Let's go.

520
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,180
How are you?

521
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,500
Are you hurt?

522
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,380
I am fine.

523
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,700
Next time,

524
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,820
I will use the Ice Fist to help you.

525
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,500
No.

526
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,020
I taught you to shout the Ice Fist

527
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,860
to make you feel the cold.

528
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,620
If you do not use it,

529
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,820
you will be hurt.

530
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,940
Don't worry.

531
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,020
You can't do it.

532
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,500
You can't do it.

533
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,140
That's right.

534
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,340
Next time,

535
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,140
I will do it

536
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,740
if you can't do it.

537
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,500
Young Master.

538
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,540
Young Master.

539
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,940
If you do it again,

540
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,260
just let us go.

541
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,660
Why do you have to do it yourself?

542
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,860
Exactly.

543
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,020
What's wrong with you today?

544
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,180
You usually

545
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,500
let the sky fall down.

546
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,500
You don't even have to

547
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,100
look at it.

548
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,940
Today is the first time

549
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,940
you go there.

550
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,220
You are just doing it for the broken order.

551
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,660
Young Master.

552
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,180
Have you forgotten that you have to

553
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,020
make a move on the first place?

554
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,540
Have you ever thought

555
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,540
that a woman in the phoenix mask

556
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,020
is going to cut the sky's treasure?

557
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,980
Why would she

558
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,020
be so arrogant and arrogant

559
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,980
to report to the world?

560
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,580
She just wants to show off.

561
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,180
You think everyone is like you?

562
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,100
You can't tell

563
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,260
what I am laughing at.

564
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,540
I think

565
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,140
the real purpose of the phoenix mask

566
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,660
is to use the sky's treasure

567
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,620
to pull the arm and

568
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,100
then revenge for the mountain.

569
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Am I wrong?

570
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,060
Revenge is true.

571
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,260
The argument is also true.

572
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,580
But the purpose

573
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,420
is to show off one person.

574
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,300
Who?

575
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,220
I...

576
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,140
You...

577
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,860
You?

578
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,260
Do you like it?

579
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,660
I just think it's beautiful.

580
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,060
Take it.

581
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,420
Give it to me.

582
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,460
No, Wu Chen.

583
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,780
This is very important.

584
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,780
You can't play around.

585
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,100
Give it back to Brother Mo Xiao.

586
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,820
It's just a misunderstanding.

587
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,980
It's nothing.

588
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,220
Then I want it too.

589
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,460
Then give it to you.

590
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,100
Or not?

591
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,260
Wu Chen.

592
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,780
You're cheating me.

593
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,580
Come back with me.

594
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
To show off the phoenix mask

595
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,260
to confirm who is the real Li Xue.

596
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,900
Tell me.

597
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,340
Master.

598
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,460
The phoenix mask has been released.

599
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,740
Mo Xiao is the main cause.

600
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,420
The phoenix mask is in Mo Xiao's hands.

601
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,100
It seems that Mo Xiao

602
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,900
has seen the intention of the phoenix mask.

603
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,700
He is a disciple of Feng Yue's Sword Master

604
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,140
and took away the phoenix mask.

605
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,460
I think he is the real Li Xue.

606
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,740
He is the real Li Xue.

607
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,900
He took away the phoenix mask.

608
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,100
He is not brave enough.

609
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,780
But Master.

610
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,420
Once Mo Xiao is released,

611
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,940
I'm afraid that the phoenix mask will...

612
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Go tell him.

613
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,820
Do something.

614
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,860
Don't affect my plan.

615
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,260
Yes.

616
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,140
Anything else?

617
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,180
Master.

618
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,860
I have a doubt.

619
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,380
The phoenix mask is missing.

620
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,020
Master.

621
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,020
You know that the phoenix mask has been released.

622
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,260
Why don't you tell me?

623
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,740
What if it is missing?

624
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,260
The phoenix mask is so big.

625
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,460
If the phoenix mask is missing,

626
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,780
it will be strange.

627
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,300
Go with him.

628
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,620
Yes.

629
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,380
Mother.

630
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,180
I let you down.

631
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,660
I don't allow you to say that.

632
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,340
You forgot.

633
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,180
How did I raise you in the 18th year?

634
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,060
Did you forget what we should do?

635
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,660
How could you let me down?

636
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
But mother.

637
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,940
We have been looking for so many years.

638
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,700
But we still don't have news.

639
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,460
What if...

640
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,380
No.

641
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,140
We will find him back.

642
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,500
He is the future master of the Tian Mo family.

643
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,500
He is the hope of my life.

644
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,860
Zhi Yan.

645
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,860
Buboard right.

646
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:22,260
The Chaldea Temple's

647
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,660
It's Leille.

648
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,860
Yes.

649
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,540
Miss.

650
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,180
I planned to prevent those guys

651
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,180
but in a boom Beiyou was blown away

652
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,040
Dynasty

653
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,920
he's already forgotten my feelings

654
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,420
he can't Properly?!

655
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,740
No

656
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,340
That kind of situation is not as increased as He was

657
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,720
He came so far and remove Shushi

658
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,100
he must've done

659
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,980
The sect leader may have another reason for this.

660
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,020
Mo Xiao did this for that Feng Yu Ling.

661
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,900
Then when Feng Yu Ling came out,

662
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,700
the Jianghu Sect had fought for Feng Yu Ling and killed him.

663
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,060
Mo Xiao took Feng Yu Ling away.

664
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,860
Maybe he wanted to stop a fight between the Jianghu Sect.

665
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,260
That said, it's like a plot of the Young Master of Mount Zu.

666
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,100
It seems that the elder brother of the sect knows more about Mo Xiao.

667
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,780
But in this way, I'm afraid that the Jianghu Sect

668
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,700
will have a lot of discussion about Mount Zu.

669
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,060
They will say that our sect leader is fighting against this evil sect

670
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,140
to steal the secret treasure of the Heaven.

671
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,940
If that crazy woman really wants to steal the secret treasure of the Heaven,

672
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,540
I, Mount Zu, will have to stop her sooner or later.

673
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,820
It won't be possible for her to be misunderstood by the world.

674
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,820
If you want to say it, then let them say it.

675
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,380
Or did the elder brother say the truth?

676
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,620
Although he said that people are strict,

677
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,020
but we are the true sect of Mount Zu,

678
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,020
we don't have to be so distant.

679
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,420
But in their way, I'm afraid that it will be hard to be quiet.

680
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,820
You don't need to go help?

681
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,420
No need. Thank you for your help.

682
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,420
These evil sects are really...

683
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,020
They know that they can't beat themselves.

684
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,620
They still have to try them one by one.

685
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,020
Our sect leaders can't use magic against them.

686
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,220
I still have to drive them away with full force.

687
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
I'm tired.

688
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,620
That's right. My secret treasure is not useful.

689
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,420
But my secret treasure won't kill them.

690
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,020
It's just that I'm just retreating from them. Can't I use it?

691
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,620
No. How did you learn how to use the mountain path?

692
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,720
I think that after you go back, you should send you to the Heaven Gate

693
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,420
and then let you learn the 1380 doors of Mount Zu.

694
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,820
You seem to be able to memorize it.

695
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,220
I don't know who always sneaks out and catches the birds.

696
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
I said that we have to protect each other and hurt each other.

697
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
Who wants you to kill me?

698
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,520
Okay. You won.

699
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,020
Mo Xiao, they are so persistent and never give up.

700
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,620
We keep fighting like this.

701
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,620
The real important guest hasn't come yet.

702
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
These are just fighting.

703
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,420
Then... we will just keep being a living stick here.

704
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,020
Of course, we won't.

705
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,820
Master, I'm not very well. There's no one on the boat.

706
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
Master.

707
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,420
How dare you find found ProductOTHER out before anyone else!

708
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,620
Yes.

709
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,300
Young master, the one who came is Tian Mojiao.

710
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,100
The main star of Dark Soul Palace, Ji Xingluo.

711
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,540
The one from Mojiao is here too.

712
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,500
It seems that this matter is getting more and more serious.

713
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,860
Why is this girl so greedy lately?

714
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,500
She's sleeping all the time and all the time.

715
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,140
She must be in the boat.

716
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,820
What boat?

717
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,060
The boat means she's floating on the water for a long time.

718
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
She'll be dizzy and dizzy. She's not feeling well.

719
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,540
Then why am I fine?

720
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,100
Of course you're fine. You're a bit puffy.

721
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,700
I just left a little gift for them on the boat.

722
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,780
What's wrong with you? You brought so many disgusting pig's fingerprints.

723
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,460
I made the pig's fingerprints. But the idea is Mojiao.

724
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,940
Who called that lady that was in the boat and gave her the other one?

725
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,020
She just wanted to borrow the knife and kill people and take advantage of the enemy.

726
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,060
We're called the mute.

727
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,820
Why do I feel that this place is so messy?

728
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,660
You're also a shipwrecked, aren't you?

729
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,060
Come on. Let me show you.

730
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,180
Let me show you.

731
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,900
Don't panic.

732
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,060
I'm not. I'm just in the boat.

733
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,820
Let's go.

734
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,780
Commander, there's no one on the boat.

735
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,820
Commander, come and take a look.

736
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,980
The black pig of Lady Poison?

737
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,020
No way.

738
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,540
She told me that Feng Mi Ling was taken away by the painter.

739
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,860
So this is a trap.

740
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,740
Come with me to find her.

741
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,140
Is it nice? Look at this.

742
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,740
I'm a natural person.

743
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,860
Xing Zhi, what are you doing?

744
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
Unless we go somewhere else,

745
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,900
would we be syrup-po directions?

746
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,340
Hold on!

747
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,780
It's a very good coin.

748
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,780
Is it like the auspicious event in Mount Mang?

749
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,780
Maybe the auspicious event in the whole world is the same.

750
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,780
Thank you, Young Master.

751
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,780
Fengdu City is more familiar with us.

752
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,780
Where are we tonight?

753
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,780
Of course, it's the Flower House.

754
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
That's in Fengdu City.

755
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,780
Actually, there's a manor inn in front of us.

756
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,780
Let's arrange it. You can come slowly.

757
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Go ahead.

758
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,780
What are you looking at?

759
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,780
Heavenly...

760
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
Buddha?

761
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,780
Heavenly Buddha?

762
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
That's so strange.

763
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
Which auspicious event is this?

764
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,780
I thought it was the auspicious event of the Celestial Master of the Heavenly Formation.

765
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,780
The auspicious event of the Heavenly Formation.

766
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,780
It's a pity that it's been so many years.

767
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,780
It's not human.

768
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Where are the people inside?

769
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,780
I thought that the Celestial Master of the Heavenly Formation...

770
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,780
His Heavenly Formation has caused some changes.

771
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,780
It's called the Disaster.

772
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,780
And now, the Celestial Master of the Heavenly Formation is back in the world.

773
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,780
I wonder if the Celestial Manor can be re-enact the light of the future.

774
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
What light?

775
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Let's go to the inn. I'm tired.

776
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,780
