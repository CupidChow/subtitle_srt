1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the future

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the future

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the future

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the future

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the future

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the future

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the future

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the future

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the future

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the future

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the future

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the future

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the future

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the future

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Flowers are blooming in the wind

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The moon in the water

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The hard part of the moon in the sky

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The hard part of the moon in the sky

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hard part of the moon in the sky

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always have a dream

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The sky has no ghost

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind is like a river

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The flower is like a flowing water

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The flowers of life

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Like a dream

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like you

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Always have a moment

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thousands of years

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The story is not clear

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rain in another world

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll wait for you at the end

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll wait for you

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 1

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can only drink cold water without fire.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You usually drink water,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
but you still need to drink a little.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
From now on,

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you must practice the Qi Du and drink some hot water.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Since I want to be with you,

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I will learn from you.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You are living alone in the mountain

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because of Qi Han's illness.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Not at all.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My master told me to live in the snow

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
because Qi Han's illness

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
can reduce my injury.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I can't control the coldness in my body.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If I live with others,

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will have an injury to them.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But you are different.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are not only afraid of Qi Han's illness,

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but also help me to get rid of Han Qi

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
when Qi Han's illness is exposed.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I can live with you.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I just temporarily use my internal force

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to stabilize your heart.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's not completely different.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think anyone who has a sense of taste

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
can do it.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
My master can't do it.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can only drink cold water in your body.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There is no one to disturb you

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
when you drink cold water in the mountain.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a good idea.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have 5 lessons to do.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can't do it without 5 lessons today.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
36 lessons must be prepared.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is your master's order.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But your master is not here.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you afraid of?

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's the same whether you are here or not.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are so stupid.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are so stupid.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You are so obedient.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then I ask you.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you don't listen to me,

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
will your master punish you?

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What are you afraid of?

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He won't punish you.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What are you afraid of?

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not that I don't know.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I never did anything wrong.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is it?

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's so late.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Can we talk tomorrow?

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I teach you the sword technique.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It can cure the coldness in your body.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
From now on,

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
after you complete your training,

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you can go down the mountain and be a person.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Down the mountain?

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I don't want to go down the mountain.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think it's quiet here.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like Mount Mang.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then you teach me the ice-cream technique.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you want me to leave?

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You still won't take me away, right?

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We are always on the same path.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You always want to live your life.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But I promise you.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will find a way to cure you.

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm tired.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not tired.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm tired.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Qu악

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You already!

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why did you come to here?

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I haven't hidden anything for years,

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and the three hours in the tavern have come.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It seems like I never believed in anything.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why is there such a thing at this moment?

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't want to leave even after you leave?

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's do Cheese Dip,

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
which is my appetite.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Zero-div за Dark Boss

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and the whole kings of the Dao family

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,380
there your reputation is not damaged.

123
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,240
Once divine thoughts are уст pure,

124
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,800
you will be able to take power from this political political barrier.

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,680
This political barrier?

126
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,060
My discipleotomize to® wake up a light to alight.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
He won't beyin patient.

128
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,880
He won't be distracted.

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,840
I onto viewed this matter,

130
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
Wu Xiao,

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,920
I will transfer you as 一君和一胜

132
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,980
Li Xue!

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
ling back this night.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm here to avenge you!

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think you really did it.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

137
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Master, I have a new evil eye.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was in my heart ten years ago.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ten years ago, I killed Li Xue by accident.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I killed her and chased after Yueming.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
From now on, I'll become a Yezhang.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can't leave.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If I can be reborn,

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I won't let this happen again.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The fate is unpredictable.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yezhang is hard to be fixed.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Everything is in the best condition.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll do my best.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Master.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please show me your name.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Master.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Master.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Master.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What are you doing?

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Your lips are so warm.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What's wrong? Are you hot?

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Your face is so red.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you're hot,

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you can go and take a shower over there.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The water is cold.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You want to take a shower with me?

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You want to take a shower with me?

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Stop it. Put on your clothes.

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Li Xue.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Li Xue?

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Where did you get the seal from?

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You mean this?

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is the seal I've been using since I was a child.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
My father said that this is the only seal I have in the world.

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you can't find me,

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you can use this to find me.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What's this?

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This is my seal.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
My father said that this is the only one in the world.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If I lose it, you can use this seal to find me.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Li Xue.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Li Xue.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Who are you?

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Who are you?

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are you Li Xue?

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Li Xue?

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Who are you?

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Who are you?

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Or is this just a coincidence?

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Master, what can I do for you?

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hualang, did you find out about the news about the snow mountain?

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The snow mountain is in chaos for the first time.

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So I haven't found any information about it.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then where is the innocent girl, Wuchen?

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you have her information?

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hualang has been chasing me to collect the information.

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The information I found is also clear.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That girl Wuchen has been living in the mountain.

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who is the master of the girl Wuchen?

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hualang is still in the mountain.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know the second person's information.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But Li Xue really didn't die.

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Master, what else do you have?

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Nothing.

201
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Continue to investigate the snow mountain and the snow demon.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a real reason for the chaos.

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Wuchen, why are you here?

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Where are you going?

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm here to remind you.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I haven't learned the swordplay you taught me.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You can't sneak away secretly.

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You are here because of this.

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So you have been staying at the door of my room.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This method is a bit stupid.

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I still have to tell you.

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If you sneak away secretly, I will go after you.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There may be something going on in the snow mountain village.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If my cold weather is exposed, I will be in trouble.

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I will take you with me tomorrow.

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I will go now.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You can go tomorrow.

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Go back to the mountain.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Mo Xiao, can you really fly this thing?

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Come on.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't need it.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
My foot is very fast.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Mo Xiao, you used to be a bird.

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Can you take two birds now?

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Moreover, if I fall into the air

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and fall into the air,

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I will be in trouble.

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What if I fall into the air?

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Have you ever thought about it?

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I have.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Now it's stable.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Can you take your hands off?

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mo Xiao, is that the mountain?

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is that the village below?

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't know.

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't know.

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know.

240
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know.

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know.

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't know.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is that the village below?

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So small.

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is that the cloud?

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is the Xuanqing Garden.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Xuanqing Garden?

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I think I've been here before.

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why am I so familiar?

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is Mount Shu.

252
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is Mount Shu's base.

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It was where I and Shizun practiced together.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Shizun?

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Then your Shizun is here too?

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He died when I was eight years old.

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I lived here with my senior sister.

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I can't live here now.

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You can't?

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Where are you living now?

261
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm a scholar in Mount Shu.

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll go back to my hometown.

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll go back with you.

264
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Wu Chen, you have the evidence.

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I wonder when it will be exposed.

266
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If the thing happened in Mount Shu,

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
it won't be as easy as it is to the village.

268
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So you stay here for now.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll bring the evidence back.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll send you off for your medical treatment.

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've known you for so long.

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You said so many things.

273
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You want to send me off.

274
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've told you.

275
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're different from others.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I won't be separated from you.

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Wu Chen,

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to prevent your cold,

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
you've been hurt countless times.

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's why I brought you back to Mount Shu.

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But the mountain is deep.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's not the mountain's disciple.

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I brought you to the mountain base in this helplessness.

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Don't worry.

285
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There's a barrier here.

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No one can enter here.

287
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You're safe here.

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But you must remember.

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't run around.

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Wait for me.

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll come back after I finish.

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Can I trust you?

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You can only trust me.

294
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I trust you.

296
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
When you come back,

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
remember to bring me a rope.

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't worry.

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If you stay here,

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I promise you'll eat the glutinous rice every day.

301
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm going.

302
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Master,

303
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
he's brought Wu Chen back to Mount Shu.

304
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Master,

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the sense of the holy stone is weak.

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The mountain barrier

307
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
hinders his sense of the stone.

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Master,

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
he's gone to Mount Shu.

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He's gone to Mount Shu.

311
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He's gone to Mount Shu.

312
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He's gone to Mount Shu.

313
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He's gone to Mount Shu.

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We're afraid that

315
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
he's gone to Mount Shu.

316
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's okay.

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is part of my plan.

318
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The mountain barrier.

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The disciple, Mo Xiao,

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
is ordered by master

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
to go to Mount Shu and get the blood demon.

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Come back safely.

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Master.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay.

325
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
When the young master leaves,

326
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
he'll bring the blood demon

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
to Mount Shu.

328
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He'll come back

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
as soon as he's back.

330
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Although he has skills,

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
he still needs to be diligent.

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He's a good man.

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
He's a good man.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He's kind and polite.

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,520
He's been

336
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,000
trained by many disciples.

337
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's been a great master

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
in Mount Shu.

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He's been a good man.

340
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Master, please go ahead and order.

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Master, please go ahead and order.

342
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Here.

343
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Please have a seat.

344
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Thank you.

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Thank you for your service.

346
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Since Master Familie Liu allows

347
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
now,

348
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the doctor became a platforms

349
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
from our group.

350
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Master,

351
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
please sit down.

352
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The blessing is yours.

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,480
that she was captured by the demon.

354
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,000
What happened?

355
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,520
Master, please don't be angry.

356
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,360
When I was at Xiangfu Mountain,

357
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,160
I was indeed in the Wuyi Valley.

358
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,680
I injured her

359
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,840
when I was fighting with the demon.

360
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,120
So I took her down

361
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
and healed her in the village.

362
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,920
But later,

363
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,840
her injuries were exposed and injured the villagers.

364
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,000
So those villagers

365
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,720
were sure that I was the one who was protecting her.

366
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
That demon girl is really a mortal.

367
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I didn't find anything

368
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,560
that was wrong.

369
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Since it's a common thing,

370
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,760
where is she now?

371
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,280
Those villagers were surprised by the demon.

372
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,120
They were afraid of the snake.

373
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,440
So I decided that the demon girl

374
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,240
was the demon girl.

375
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,080
I also wanted to kill her.

376
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,080
I couldn't do anything.

377
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
So I secretly took her down.

378
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,720
I gave her a place

379
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,400
to be safe.

380
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,000
She was healed and recovered.

381
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,160
Mo Xiao,

382
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,360
you've been doing this for a long time.

383
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
You never disobey the rules.

384
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,120
I believe

385
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,640
you have your own reason

386
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,280
to deal with this.

387
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,240
It's hard to get off the mountain.

388
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,760
You should go back and rest.

389
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,760
As for the rumor about the villagers,

390
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,800
I will send someone

391
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,160
to review the rumor.

392
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,120
You don't have to do it again.

393
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Thank you for your understanding.

394
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,200
I'll take my leave.

395
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,800
This is just alaughter.

396
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
So nice to see you.

397
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,520
Brother Hao,

398
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,840
ríao ran away for a long time.

399
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,800
Have you missed me?

400
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,960
Step going back

401
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,920
to Du Manor

402
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,240
on this tuan properly

403
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,840
from Shao Chow Men?

404
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,920
How stable is he!

405
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Relax.

406
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,280
Nothing to worry about.

407
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,840
Brother Mo Xiao,

408
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,920
have you been hurt?

409
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,880
Are you underbacks?

410
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,960
It must be very cold on the mount.

411
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,400
Have you been cold?

412
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,120
How could she get hurt?

413
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
How could she get sick?

414
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,200
Don't try to find a cure.

415
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,840
How could I?

416
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,640
Do I care about Brother Mo Xiao?

417
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,920
Not like you.

418
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
You just care about your big gold leaf.

419
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,320
People are already back.

420
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
You care about Ma Hou Pang.

421
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,280
What about the wound?

422
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
What about the illness?

423
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
Can you take care of her?

424
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Xie Ling Yu, shut up.

425
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,760
From now on,

426
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,240
you don't need to say a word to me.

427
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,120
Do you think I love to talk to you?

428
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
You little girl.

429
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,560
What's good about me?

430
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,600
Fine.

431
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
I'll keep my word.

432
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Brother Mo Xiao.

433
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Welcome, Young Master.

434
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
What are you doing?

435
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Get up and talk.

436
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
Young Master, we're going down the mountain to get rid of demons.

437
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Why didn't you take us three

438
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
and go alone?

439
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,400
It's dangerous.

440
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
We're all worried about you

441
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,400
these days.

442
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
Yes, Young Master.

443
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
We've been keeping you for ten years.

444
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
We've been in charge of protecting your safety.

445
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,400
This time, you went alone to get rid of demons.

446
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,800
We can only stand by and watch.

447
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,200
It's really dangerous.

448
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
This...

449
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
Get up and talk.

450
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
You two

451
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
don't trust me that much.

452
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Young Master.

453
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
The destiny of the three of us

454
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,200
is to protect your safety.

455
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,400
In the future, no matter what you do,

456
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
please take us by your side.

457
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Why didn't you talk to me?

458
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
I just think

459
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
you're the one who did it.

460
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,000
You must have your own thoughts.

461
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,800
I didn't expect you to be so considerate

462
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
and carefree.

463
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,400
You're so thoughtful.

464
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
Young Master, you don't have to

465
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,800
tell us.

466
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
We've been thinking too much.

467
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,800
No matter what you do,

468
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,000
we'll always be your guards.

469
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's right.

470
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay.

471
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,800
Don't be angry.

472
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Get up.

473
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
This time, it was a sudden attack.

474
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
You three just left me without telling me.

475
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I also don't want you to be in trouble.

476
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,800
Okay. I promise you.

477
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
I'll take you

478
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
to the next trip.

479
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
Are you tired?

480
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,400
You've been off the mountain for so long.

481
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,200
You haven't been to the capital for a long time.

482
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
What do you want to eat today?

483
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
No.

484
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm just tired.

485
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
Then you go to bed.

486
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,800
We'll leave now.

487
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Good night.

488
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
Hey, Zi Su.

489
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Do you know how to cook glutinous rice balls?

490
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
What?

491
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,600
You want to eat glutinous rice balls?

492
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,800
And you never eat sweet food.

493
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Okay.

494
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Forget you know about it.

495
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I can!

496
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,600
I'll go make the cake later.

497
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Master, what can I do for you?

498
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Qian Chuan, this time, I will go to the Mount Wang to surrender to Xue Yao.

499
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I heard that a woman from the mortal world was hurt by Xue Yao.

500
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
She is in a deep wound.

501
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,600
I order you to investigate the truth.

502
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Mo Xiang.

503
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Mo Xiang.

504
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Lower your voice and scare me back to Xiaobai.

505
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
What kind of bird are you?

506
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
You've seen me many times. You've seen me every time.

507
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
You still don't recognize me?

508
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Fine. Don't worry. They are not birds.

509
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
They are not afraid of the wind and the trees.

510
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I think you are too stubborn to stop them.

511
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Then you are the master.

512
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Are you here to help me with the bird?

513
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Of course not.

514
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
I'm here to get money.

515
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
What money?

516
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,600
You are not here to get money, are you?

517
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Where is my gold leaf?

518
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
I spent it all.

519
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
All?

520
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You bought the house and made a living.

521
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Do you know what the concept of gold leaf is?

522
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
I spent all the money.

523
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
What did you ask me to spend?

524
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Hao, sit down.

525
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
This is simple.

526
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
I've made up my mind for you.

527
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
You've been practicing magic for years.

528
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I think the new year is good.

529
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Of course, before my next year,

530
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I won't give you the chance to introduce us.

531
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Bring it here.

532
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Don't be so mean.

533
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,600
You are so mean.

534
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I'm the leader of Iron Gate.

535
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
You can't be so polite.

536
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Who told you to bully us?

537
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I bullied him.

538
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
He is a good man.

539
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
He spent all his money on me.

540
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
He is so handsome.

541
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
He bullied me.

542
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
You found it yourself.

543
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
You can't steal 18 meters.

544
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
A peasant?

545
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Mo Xiao.

546
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I know you.

547
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
You've never eaten sweet food.

548
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Now you want to eat your peasant.

549
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Where is your blood?

550
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Why do you want to come back?

551
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
You are so mean.

552
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I can't change my taste.

553
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
You are so mean.

554
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm Mo Xiao, a disciple of Mount Jin.

555
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm here to save you.

556
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
I'm a special patient.

557
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
I have a cold.

558
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Cold is so hard to get.

559
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I can't be so gentle.

560
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
If I get angry or angry,

561
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I can't hide my face.

562
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
I can't hide my face.

563
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
I can't hide my face.

564
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
I can't hide my face.

565
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
If I can't practice well,

566
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
it's your problem.

567
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Wait for me.

568
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I don't know what's going on.

569
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Don't be angry.

570
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Don't be angry.

571
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Why are you here?

572
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I have some business to do.

573
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Oh, right.

574
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I bought some glutinous rice.

575
00:30:47,600 --> 00:31:02,360
Makes me wonder why

576
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,640
why

577
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,960
Why did you give another wrong answer

578
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
why did you give another wrong answer

579
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,920
Why didn't you think of the answer

580
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,160
Why did you take another wrong answer

581
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,800
Why didn't you think of the answer

582
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,080
Maybe Physical Master knew

583
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
They love to hide?

584
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,080
No one has ever touched them except me.

585
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,080
It seems like they are far away from you.

586
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Of course.

587
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,080
I'm different from others.

588
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
Give me your hand.

589
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Do they still remember you?

590
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
What? Don't you like it?

591
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,080
I don't like birds.

592
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
I remember my blood.

593
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,080
I left the mountain, but I'm still here.

594
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,080
I don't know if I can find a fruit after he left me.

595
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,080
If you're worried, I'll go to the mountain to pick up the blood.

596
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Really?

597
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
It's late. I'll go back.

598
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
You're leaving so soon?

599
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Oh, right.

600
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
This is the new thing.

601
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
Take it well.

602
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
If you need anything, you can call me.

603
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
I'll be there in time.

604
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Rest early.

605
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
I'll be there in time.

606
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm here.

607
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I'm here.

608
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
I'm here.

609
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
I'm here.

610
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Mo Xiang.

611
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
What's the matter?

612
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
This is really useful.

613
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Don't bother about it.

614
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Okay

615
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Why

616
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,340
Why didn't she let me sleep on her abacus

617
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:16,340
When I was on the mountain, I was holding Xue'er to sleep.

618
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,340
They are different from Xue'er.

619
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,340
You can't sleep in the bed.

620
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,740
Go to bed.

621
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,340
Can you wait for me to go to bed?

622
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,740
Yesterday, Tianyu Sect was arrested.

623
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,140
The special demon Mo Xiao went to Tianyu to talk.

624
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,540
I think it's the young master of Mount Shu.

625
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
He is the demon this time.

626
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,140
He is a living hell out there.

627
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,340
This is the chance to show the style of Mount Shu.

628
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,340
That's right.

629
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,540
Mo Xiao.

630
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,740
I'm here.

631
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,340
Since it's the demon of the sect,

632
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,340
you can leave in a few days.

633
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
They are holding a new meeting.

634
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,740
You can also increase the number of people.

635
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:31,940
Yes.

636
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,140
Come on.

637
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,140
Sit down.

638
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,140
I...

639
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,140
Lin Yun, do you have something to say?

640
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Master, I'm fine.

641
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,540
Don't mind it.

642
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,540
Okay.

643
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,540
Si Su.

644
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
Where is your young master?

645
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
I'm here.

646
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,540
I'm here.

647
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,540
I'm here.

648
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,540
You are so rude.

649
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,540
Can you change your bad habits?

650
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,540
You can't get married in time.

651
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,740
Who wants to marry?

652
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,340
What?

653
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
If you don't marry,

654
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,140
will you give your young master a lifetime?

655
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,940
Yes.

656
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,340
I'll make a rice ball for him forever.

657
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Rice ball?

658
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,540
He is going to eat rice balls again?

659
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,140
Yes.

660
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,540
He has always wanted to eat something like this.

661
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,540
He wants to eat it on the road.

662
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,340
He has gone?

663
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,140
When?

664
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,940
Just now.

665
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,140
Bad.

666
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,940
Come out.

667
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,140
Since I'm here,

668
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,940
you don't have to hide anything.

669
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,340
Did your kid hide in the house?

670
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
I want to see what kind of beauty he is.

671
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,140
He likes to eat this glutinous rice ball.

672
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,140
It's not what you think.

673
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,540
You know how to hide.

674
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,340
I'm sure you won't find out if you hide in this place.

675
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
I won't hide.

676
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,940
I just don't want to trouble you.

677
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,340
I just don't want to trouble you.

678
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Who are you?

679
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,340
Wuchen.

680
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,540
This is...

681
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,540
You brought back that woman?

682
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
I don't think she is that kind of person.

683
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,740
What do you mean?

684
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,540
Are you a little bit lack of vision?

685
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,340
What is the vision?

686
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,740
Do you think I'm stupid?

687
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,140
Or is she really stupid?

688
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,540
She thinks you are stupid.

689
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,540
All right.

690
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Ms. Wuchen grew up in the Manshan Pavilion.

691
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,740
Don't worry.

692
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,940
Don't make trouble.

693
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,540
You are Wuchen, right?

694
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,540
I'll introduce myself.

695
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,140
I'm the head of the Iron Gate of Mount Shu

696
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,140
of the Fengshen Junlang Yushu.

697
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,540
Xie Lin Yun.

698
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,740
Why is her name so long?

699
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,140
Because she is stupid.

700
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Her name is Xie Lin Yun.

701
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,140
Xie Lin Yun?

702
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,940
You gave us this leaf.

703
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,340
You gave it to us, right?

704
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,940
I took it to exchange things.

705
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,940
Exchange?

706
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,140
Then buy it.

707
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,340
What did you buy?

708
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,140
I changed my cloth,

709
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,140
clothes,

710
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,740
and windmill.

711
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,140
Those gold leaves are very useful.

712
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,140
Can you bring more next time?

713
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,140
Next time?

714
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,740
You are so eloquent.

715
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
You two are so perfect.

716
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,540
Don't talk nonsense.

717
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,740
Come with me.

718
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
I have something to tell you.

719
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:47,940
Wuchen.

720
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,340
A girl group?

721
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,540
You want me to take care of Wuchen?

722
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,740
Don't, don't, don't, Mo Xiao.

723
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,340
I'm afraid that he will be punished by Han Zhou.

724
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,340
I can't handle it.

725
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,140
Besides,

726
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,540
if the chief master finds out,

727
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,940
he will lock me in the Iron Gate.

728
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,540
My dad will kill me.

729
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,340
Mo Xiao,

730
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,740
we are brothers.

731
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,340
You can't harm me.

732
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,540
I set up the barrier outside the Iron Gate.

733
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,540
I will tell you how to open it.

734
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,540
Don't worry.

735
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,740
No one will come in.

736
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,940
It's not a long time.

737
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
It won't be too long.

738
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,940
I am looking for someone to help him.

739
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,540
After Wuchen's Han Zheng is cured,

740
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,740
I will send him off the mountain.

741
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,340
I will find a small town to live in.

742
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Who are you looking for?

743
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,740
I need your help.

744
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,740
Help me find the best peach blossom.

745
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Peach blossom?

746
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,540
The one you are looking for

747
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,140
is the god of medicine.

748
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,140
That's right.

749
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Little black.

750
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
Mo Xiao.

751
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,540
Mo Xiao.

752
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,340
How do you feel that you are afraid of him?

753
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,740
You are afraid of me?

754
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,740
You are afraid of me?

755
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,940
I...

756
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,340
What am I afraid of?

757
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,940
Look at you.

758
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,340
You are afraid that he will eat you.

759
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,340
Mo Xiao.

760
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,140
You are so red-skinned.

761
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,540
It's the first time I see you red-skinned.

762
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,340
Tell me.

763
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,740
Is there something that is hiding from me?

764
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,740
I will tell you.

765
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,140
I...

766
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,740
You are red-skinned.

767
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,140
Are you hot?

768
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,940
Don't be rude.

769
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,540
Wuchen.

770
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,940
I will send my master to the far away gate.

771
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,340
I can come back in a few days.

772
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,540
I will ask Xie Lingyun to come to you.

773
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,740
You just stay here.

774
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,940
Practice the ice sword technique I taught you.

775
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,540
Don't move around.

776
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,540
Can I not go?

777
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,340
No.

778
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,340
But...

779
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,940
If you have any problem,

780
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,540
call me with the new year's poem.

781
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,740
I will show up.

782
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
New year's poem?

783
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,940
You gave him the new year's poem?

784
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,340
I did.

785
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,340
Mo Xiao.

786
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,740
Don't you feel sorry for me?

787
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,940
I have been taking care of you for years.

788
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,140
You never give up.

789
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,940
Now,

790
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,940
you are giving him this little girl who has just met you.

791
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,540
You must give me a reasonable explanation today.

792
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,540
You are a young master of Iron Gate.

793
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
You have a master of Mo's house.

794
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,340
You have so many tricks.

795
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,740
You just give me a toy

796
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,340
when you are thinking about the new year.

797
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,140
I will give you a reasonable explanation.

798
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,940
It doesn't matter if it's my business.

799
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,940
It's your business whether you give it or not.

800
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,940
I am a little worried.

801
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,340
I am a little worried.

802
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,740
I am a little worried.

803
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,140
I am a little worried.

804
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,740
I am a little worried.

I am a little worried.

812
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,340
I am a little worried.

813
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,540
I am a little worried.

814
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,940

816
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,740
I am a little worried.

817
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
I am a little worried.

818
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,340
I am a little worried.

819
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,940
I am a little worried.

820
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,340
I am a little worried.

821
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,940
I am a little worried.

822
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,340
I am a little worried.

823
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,740
I am a little worried.

824
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,340
I am a little worried.

825
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,740
I am a little worried.

826
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,540
I am a little worried.

827
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,940
I am a little worried.

828
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,540
I am a little worried.

829
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,140
I am a little worried.

830
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,740
I am a little worried.

831
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,740
I am a little worried.

832
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,540
I am a little worried.

833
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,340
I am a little worried.

834
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,940
I am a little worried.

835
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,740
I am a little worried.

836
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,540
I am a little worried.

837
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,140
I am a little worried.

838
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,940
I am a little worried.

839
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,940
I am a little worried.

840
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,340

I am a little worried.

842
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,440
I am a little worried.

843
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,540
In Może,

844
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,140
I will not be youthful

845
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,140
today.

846
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,840
I keep waiting for Pet confusion.

847
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,140
I keep waiting for Pet confusion.

848
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,140
I keep waiting for Pet confusion.

849
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:35,940
I feel I can survive

850
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,740
without your love class.

851
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,940
In Może,

852
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,540
I will go to the Kenpo Tavern.

853
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,540
I'm not afraid of the future.

854
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540

00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
I'm not afraid of the future.

880
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,540
I'm not afraid of the future.
