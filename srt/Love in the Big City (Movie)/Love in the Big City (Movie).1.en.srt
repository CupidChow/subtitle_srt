Hi, hon.

FRESHMAN ORIENTATION

3
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,720
-Hi, I'm Chul-gu. What's your dream?
-Hi.

4
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
I want to be a diplomat.

5
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,000
-What the hell!
-Who's that?

6
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,480
Hello.

7
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,680
Cheers! Bottoms up!

8
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,840
Bottoms up!

9
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Cheers.

10
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,240
You're from Paris? Where did you live?

11
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
First in the 15th,
then at a friend's in Belleville.

12
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,800
Belleville. That's nice.

13
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Yes, it was way better than the 15th.

14
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,560
Why are you majoring in French?

15
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,600
Because I like Albert Camus.

16
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,160
What? Camus was Moroccan.

17
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
He was Algerian.

18
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
I mean, he's not French.

19
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
Dang.

20
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
-But he wrote in French.
-Hey.

21
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,720
In the army,
if you play soccer with a general…

22
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,160
-Let's get a smoke.
-…you can't block the ball…

23
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
Let's go.

24
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,760
-Restroom? Me too.
-Me too.

25
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080
Wait for me.

26
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,880
-Hey.
-I got to pee.

27
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
I like Camus too. <i>The Stranger.</i>

28
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
"Maman died today."

29
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
"Or yesterday maybe, I don't know."

30
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,520
"I got a telegram from the home:"

31
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,120
"Mother deceased."

32
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,440
<i>"Adieu"</i> is a compound word
with the preposition "à" and "Dieu."

33
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,480
In English, it means "to God."
It means "with God."

34
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,480
Thus, it means "Though we part now,
let's meet again with God."

35
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,000
In Korean, we say,

36
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,040
"Let's not meet till we die, jerk."

37
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
Working hard on your projects?

38
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,160
Midterms are coming, so work hard.

39
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Yes?

40
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,520
FRENCH LIT DUDES' CHAT GROUP

41
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,000
<i>Isn't she cool? Such confidence.</i>
<i>Definitely European.</i>

42
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
<i>I think she just wants to stand out.</i>

43
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
<i>Totally agree.</i>

44
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
<i>Anyway, she's mine.</i>

45
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,720
Is she really dating Olivier?

46
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,960
Don't know.

47
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,160
I heard a comp-science sucker
does her assignments for her.

48
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
Really?

49
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,280
She smokes anywhere she wants
and seems so carefree.

50
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,400
Hey, didn't she wear
the same clothes yesterday?

51
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,120
You're gonna chew his face off.

52
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,600
Hello.

53
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,960
Hey. Let's just go get a drink.

54
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,040
I don't drink with girls.

55
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,880
Hey.

56
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,920
Wanna do the team project with me?

57
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,760
What? Think you found out my weakness?

58
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
What?

59
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm not interested in doing
your assignments. Find someone else.

60
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,200
TO OLIVIER

61
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,200

SOLOMON'S STORY

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,120
<i>Albinos were considered sacred,</i>
<i>but as they were not protected properly…</i>

68
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,680
-Mom.
<i>-…they had very low survival rates.</i>

69
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,200
-Got some money?
-Why do you ask?

70
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,920
-I got to go and live in the States.
-Why?

71
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,960
I think it'll be hard to live here.

72
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,320
Then you should've majored in English.

73
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,720
I'll go to France then.

74
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,920
Just join the army.

75
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,960
Did you hear?

76
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,679
-No way.
-There's a witness.

77
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,240
What? Someone saw it?

78
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,240
I'm serious.

79
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
-Bullshit.
-What is it?

80
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
He keeps saying weird stuff.

81
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
It's true.

82
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,640
You really saw him?

83
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
My eyesight's good.
I'm telling you saw him.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
-You're saying Olivier is gay?
-What?

85
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,680
I saw him go into a hotel with a guy.

86
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
In Itaewon too.

87
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,720
-Gross!
-Right?

88
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,120
-Maybe it was a girl with short hair?
-Yeah.

89
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,160
No.

90
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,960
He was this tall, skinny, and his face…

91
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,880
-What?
-What is it?

92
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,440
His face was slim and he had monolids.

93
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,680
Just like him.

94
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,160
Hey. I forgot to give this
back to you last night.

95
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,960
You were hilarious.

96
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,720
I woke up laughing because of you.

97
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,640
You're so funny.

98
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,520
Laugh, come on.

99
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,160
-It was fun, right?
-Yeah.

100
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
Hello!

101
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,000
-Hello!
-See you later.

102
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Take your seats.

103
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
It's okay, man. Don't be sad.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,120
Our last class ended
before we got to Arthur Rimbaud.

105
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,960
As I mentioned, Rimbaud is an important
part of modern French literature…

106
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
A beer, please.

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's wrong?

108
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
What?

109
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,280
Are you mad?

110
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm not mad, just embarrassed.

111
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,600
Nice lighter. Where did you get it?

112
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,000
-It's not mine.
-Really?

113
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Then give it to me.

114
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,920
I'll give you
a double shot of tequila for it.

115
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,120
NICE SCREENSHOT!

116
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,400
<i>-They're KJH's boobs.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

117
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
<i>It's her for sure. But they're not for me.</i>

118
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,600
<i>How do you know?</i>

119
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,280
<i>From their size, and the location</i>
<i>of that mole on the chest.</i>

120
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,640
<i>It's totally her.</i>

121
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
<i>Thought they'd be grapefruits, not kiwis.</i>

122
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,680
<i>-A.</i>
<i>-B.</i>

123
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,640
<i>-More like tangerines.</i>
<i>-75B. They're mangos.</i>

129
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,200
Cellphones off. We'll start soon.

130
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,640
-He's a photo-editing expert.
-Really?

131
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,200
The boobs must be her.

132
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,000
I'd drop out if I were her.

133
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,760
Maybe she did.

134
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,400
Close your books and clear your desks.

135
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,040
<i>I heard it's you. Slut.</i>

136
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,320
Quiet.

137
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
KOO JAE-HEE

138
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Quiet.

139
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,600
Look. No mole.

140
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,720
Full fucking A-cup.

141
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,760
So it's not her?

142
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,800
<i>Koo Jae-hee became a legend</i>
<i>in the French department</i>

143
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,000
<i>for flashing the class,</i>

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,840
<i>and her nickname changed</i>

<i>Damn Fucking Losers Talking Bullshit.</i>

147
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Here.

148
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,880
Awesome!

149
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,400
<i>Jae-hee was born in Daegu,</i>
<i>and spent her high school years in Paris.</i>

150
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
<i>When she got drunk,</i>
<i>she spoke French and sang French songs.</i>

151
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,680
<i>She was an overachiever.</i>

152
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
<i>She'd even sell her scooter</i>
<i>for more drinks.</i>

153
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,040
<i>And was diligent enough to check</i>
<i>the sanitation of club restrooms daily.</i>

154
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Hey.

155
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,240
Where'd you learn
to be so cold and cranky?

156
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
What do you mean?

157
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,240
Don't you remember?

158
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,920
"What? Think you found out my weakness?"

159
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,600
When did I say that?

160
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Jang Heung-soo…

161
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,080
how can being yourself

162
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,160
possibly be a weakness?

163
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,960
Let's toast.

164
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,520
<i>We bonded over</i>
<i>our natural outsider tendencies</i>

165
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
<i>and nightlife preferences.</i>

166
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,320
<i>We had our youth and energy.</i>

167
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,280
<i>We spent like crazy without thinking.</i>

168
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
Five, four, three, two, one!

169
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,520
Happy New Year!

170
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
<i>Crazy Bitch met Gay Friend.</i>

171
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,640
<i>And so began our wild life together.</i>

172
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,160
-How much is the rent here?
-Don't know.

173
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,240
I got it on lease. Why?

174
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,920
Just wondering.

175
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,800
Let's eat.

176
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
I don't think I can eat.

177
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
I should quit drinking.

178
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,080
Me too.
I feel like throwing up just hearing that.

179
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm never drinking again.

180
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,520
If I do, I'm not human.

181
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm not human.

182
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,120
Hurry up. Come on.

183
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,040
Is it really like in the movies?
Do Parisians not care if you're gay?

184
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,600
Jerks are everywhere.
There's just less of them there.

185
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,320
There's a lot of them here.

186
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,280
So you went alone
and lived in someone else's house?

187
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,880
Your parents must've worried a lot.

188
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,440
My parents never visited once
while I was there.

189
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,400
Not even once? In four years?

190
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
They don't really care about me.

191
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
They're too busy on their high horses.

192
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,080
Damn.

193
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,040
What? Feeling sorry for me?

194
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
No, I'm fucking jealous.

195
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,560
I wish Mom would stop caring so much
and just give me deposit money.

196
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,280
Hey.

197
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,720
The deal was that I move out
and earn my keep.

198
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
You at least get an allowance.

199
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
HOW ARE YOU? I MISS YOU.

200
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,800
The DJ?

201
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,640
"How are you? I miss you."

202
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,000
So lame.

203
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Say you met a big dude.

204
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,360
I couldn't do that.

205
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,520
He's still aching with love for me.

206
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,040
Love? Yeah, right.

207
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,800
Babe, lend me some money.

208
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,200
Are you crazy?! Stop. Give it to me.

209
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
<i>How much?</i>

210
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,680
A million won.

211
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,880
He left me on read.

212
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,240
Cheap bastard.

213
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,920
-Here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

214
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,480
I'll catch it. Throw it.

215
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,640
Look where you're throwing!

216
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm so sorry.

217
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,600
I passed, but my friend missed.

218
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,040
What the hell was…

219
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,360
Let me buy you another coffee.

220
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,840
Why do you like that nerd?

221
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,120
He's not a nerd.
He's the head of the basketball club.

222
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,560
Just sleep with him and move on.
Dating is too much work.

223
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,560
There's nothing more fun than dating.

224
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,320
Listen, dating is like a red dress.

225
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,240
You only wear it occasionally,
but others think you wear it all the time.

226
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,240
It's your loss.

227
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
They count all the men you meet
and talk shit about you

228
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,200
but they don't know
you're a romantic at heart.

229
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,800
Who cares?

230
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,840
You know the real me.

231
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
I don't care what others think.

232
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,720
I'm going to try everything I can.

233
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,240
I don't want to regret
not doing things later.

234
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,000
Come on, I don't think I look that bad.

235
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,160
No, it's not that.

236
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,520
I feel sick from lunch.

237
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,640
Why you…

238
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Didn't you wanna buy a shirt? Try one on.

239
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,760
Now, find your match.

240
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,920
First time at a drink and meet?

241
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Pardon?

242
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,480
Is it your first time here?

243
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
No.

244
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm not feeling well. Excuse me.

245
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Excuse me.

246
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,000
Hi, cutie.

247
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,160
How about the loser escorts the winner
to heaven tonight?

248
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,480
-What the…
-What the hell?!

249
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,440
That's gross!

250
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,440
Are you okay?

251
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,240
I'm so sorry.

252
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,440
It's okay.
I was gonna throw them out anyway.

253
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,120
Throw away Gucci shoes?

254
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,320
Why'd you hold my hand without consent?

255
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,160
I'm sorry. I got excited.

256
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm expressive
when it comes to things I like.

257
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,320
Forget it.
I'm sensitive about stuff like that.

258
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,200
HEUNG-SOO
CALL ME

259
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,520
KOO JAE-HEE

260
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hi.

261
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Know what he said
after walking me home tonight?

262
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,600
"Lend me some money"?

263
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,200
He asked if we could hold hands.
Cute, huh?

264
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,640
He's so pure and innocent.

265
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,840
Guess that means
you two didn't go too far.

266
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,960
He's so sweet.

267
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,320
He smelled like soap.
I got so turned on that I almost threw up.

268
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,120
-I threw up for real.
-Why?

269
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,120
That's enough, sis.
You sound just like Mom.

270
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is someone with you?

271
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,120
That's right.

272
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm on my way.

273
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,400
My sister's mad at me. I'd better go.

274
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
What's your name?

275
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,800
My name's Kwon Su-ho.

276
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,080
Let's go. I'll take you home.

277
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,400
Where did you park your car?

278
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,440
I'll pay you back for the shoes.

279
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,080
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

280
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
No.

281
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,680
I'll really pay you back.

282
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,040
I can touch my tongue to my elbow.

283
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Oh…

284
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,560
Someone was right outside that window.

285
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,320
One of my panties is missing too.

286
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Don't be crazy. We're on the third floor.

287
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,320
I'm not crazy.

288
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,840
Why shower
if you only went out for drinks?

289
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,120
I told you, I threw up.

290
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,560
-I'm gonna quit drinking.
-Yeah, right.

291
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Damn it.

292
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,520
That's not all.

293
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,920
Something smells sweet.

294
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,600
Give me some details.

295
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,320
Is he cute? How old is he?

296
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,480
-Don't know. I'm not seeing him again.
-Why? Did it suck?

297
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,360
It was great.

298
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Really?

299
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,240
Then why not date him?

300
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,760
I thought about that.

301
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,520
But he's the type to jump into love.

302
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,920
I can't commit.

303
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,840
Why is that a problem?

304
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Sleep over.

305
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,600
It's okay. I'll go home.

306
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,480
What are you, Cinderella?
We have an early lecture tomorrow.

307
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,040
I won't bite.

308
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,680
This bed's made of stone.

309
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,480
Oh, no. Are you okay?

310
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,200
No. I think I have a concussion.

311
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,640
You look like an angel.

312
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,120
It must really have a concussion.
I'm hearing things.

313
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,120
I hear it too.

314
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,280
Why haven't you taken your meds?

315
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,480
-Didn't she go out of town?
-She did. Why is she here?

316
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
What do we do?

317
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,600
-I'll just introduce myself.
-No!

318
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,200
-Hurry.
-Wait.

319
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Go.

320
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,360
I was just stretching.

321
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,200
I had no time to clean up.

322
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,120
I was going to clean before you came.

323
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,480
Anyway, why are you here?

324
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,880
The hospital paged your dad.

325
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Don't worry.

326
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,480
-Mommy will clean up. You go study.
-No! I'll…

327
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,560
I'll do it myself. Mommy must be tired.

328
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,360
Grab my hands.

329
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,280
Go take your cold medication. You forgot.

330
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,960
I'll clean this place up perfectly.

331
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,280
What a pigsty.

332
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,400
Why is the housekeeper off today?

333
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
Something's stuck.

334
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
How embarrassing!

335
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,640
So you borrowed his mom's clothes
and came home?

336
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,200
You should've seen
the look on their faces.

337
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,400
Like I was a rapist or something.

338
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,600
If his mommy and I were drowning,
he wouldn't even think about me.

339
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,240
-Bastard.
-Relax. Here.

340
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,400
It's so cold! Don't your teeth hurt?

341
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,280
So cold that it'll clear your head.

342
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
It's Gucci.

343
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,600
<i>How are you? Are you free on the weekend?</i>

344
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,480
Why are you here instead of your place?

345
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,560
You said you're scared of the perv.

346
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,720
-And class starts early tomorrow.
-Oh, my puppy!

347
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,600
But I swear my underwear is missing.

348
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,800
I can't find it anywhere.

349
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Maybe the vacuum ate it
along with your skirt.

350
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,120
Think that's funny?

351
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,760
Look carefully in the balcony.
It must be there.

352
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,080
I already looked.

353
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,840
Maybe the wind blew it away.

354
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Found it?

355
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,560
What are you doing?

356
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Is he dead?

357
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,040
-Heung-soo!
-What?

358
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
He's got something else to say about it.

359
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,880
-Find my cat.
-Come here, please.

360
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,920
Come on. You believe he climbed up there
to save a cat?

361
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,880
There are no surveillance cams.

362
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,200
What can we do?

363
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,120
Go search his house.
You'll find my panties there. Wonderbra.

364
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,440
Is it panties or a bra?

365
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,120
Panties! Wonderbra is the brand!

366
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,880
Jae-hee, calm down.

367
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,200
Can't believe that actually happened.

368
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,120
Are you okay?

369
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,320
Of course.

370
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,200
If I see that perv again,
I'll rip his dick off.

371
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,440
That's a little extreme.

372
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,040
If you ever bump into him,
grab hold of his balls like this.

373
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
Then run straight to that police station.

374
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,240
And call me on the way there. Got it?

375
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,160
Damn crazy bastards.

376
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,280
That bastard must live around here.

377
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,560
<i>Soon after, I moved in with Jae-hee,</i>
<i>and we agreed to split the bills.</i>

378
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
ROOMMATE RULES

379
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
Unpack.

380
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,720
It's so cold.

381
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,760
Heung-soo!

382
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
What is it?

383
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,040
-It's nothing.
-Watching porn?

384
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,920
-Stop it.
-Let's watch it together.

385
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,200
Excuse me.

386
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,680
<i>If any losers came on too strong,</i>

387
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,240
<i>I pretended to be</i>
<i>Jae-hee's roommate, Ji-eun.</i>

388
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,160
<i>And Jae-hee pretended to be</i>
<i>my older sister, Heung-ja.</i>

389
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,360
<i>And so we began living together.</i>

2013 SHORT STORY CONTEST ENTRY:
WITHIN THE LIMITS

391
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Hey!

392
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,920
What's that?

393
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
My report.

394
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm taking TOEIC classes.
Let's study together.

395
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,200
I can barely afford to pay the bills.

396
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,480
Then skip this month.
I got paid for that translation gig.

397
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,120
I can't do that.

398
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,680
Even between friends, a deal is a deal.

399
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,440
Why can't you call him your boyfriend?

400
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Dating in secret is so sexy.

401
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,159
Listen, there's nothing worse than a guy
not giving you his name or time,

402
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,560
especially in dating.

403
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,600
Aren't you worried?

404
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,520
Heung-soo,
I don't worry or calculate things.

405
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,719
I just date.

406
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,840
Three minutes till class starts!
Let's run!

407
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,560
That's your class, not mine.

408
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,920
NEW LITERARY CONTEST ENTRY

409
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,840
It's on sale. Two for one.

410
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,679
Hi.

411
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,000
Do you

412
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,680
want to come to my school festival?

413
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,280
Festival?

414
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,440
Hey. Take a look at this.

415
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,560
Please come.

416
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,280
What was that? Who's he? Spill the beans.

417
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,120
He's just a customer.

418
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,600
What is it this time?

419
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Look at this.

420
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,040
He doesn't answer my calls,
but he's liked her post.

421
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,080
Isn't that suspicious?

422
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Hey. Kill the asshole.

423
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
What are you sorry for?

424
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,000
I didn't know she was your sister.
You look so different.

425
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Hey!

426
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,920
You don't know why I'm mad, do you?

427
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,960
You don't trust me.

428
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,880
That hurts me the most.

429
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,240
Don't you get it?

430
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,640
You're so pretty.

431
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,720
What are you doing?

432
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,640
Heung-soo, I think

433
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,360
I'm in love.

434
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,680
Next patient, please.

435
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,040
Come on.
It's just the dopamine messing with you.

436
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,920
How do you know
what's love and what isn't?

437
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,240
What do you base it on?

438
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,840
To be honest, I don't know how much
you have to like someone to be in love.

439
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
But…

440
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,840
I miss him.

441
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,360
I think missing someone
is more real than love.

442
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,480
Love is too abstract and hard to define,

443
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,920
but missing someone is a simple feeling.

444
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,520
I miss him.

445
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,280
So much.

446
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,520
<i>Even professors and senior grads</i>
<i>are gonna be there.</i>

447
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
<i>Everyone's so nervous.</i>

448
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,600
If you need a hand, I can come help.

449
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,080
<i>No, I have loads of help.</i>

450
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,920
<i>I don't want to trouble you.</i>

451
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,280
-All right. Call me when you're done.
<i>-Okay.</i>

<i>It's a guitar club. It'll be fun.</i>

455
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,720
The rice wine's good, right?

456
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Sun-woo!

457
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,840
You have loads of help,
but not enough snacks, right?

458
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,320
Who's that?

459
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,080
Well…

460
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,160
You must be Sun-woo's older sister.

461
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,520
Hi. Nice to meet you.

462
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
FOR THE RIGHT TO LOVE

463
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,800
LGBTQ+ RIGHTS CLUB

464
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
You said

465
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,440
-she was your sister.
-Hey!

466
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,240
When did I say that?

467
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,640
I'm sorry. This is just too embarrassing.

468
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,600
I'll wait in the car.
Settle things with her.

469
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,240
-Yeo-jin, wait.
-Let go.

470
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,600
I was just nice to her.
She must be confused.

471
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,240
It's not like that. I really…

472
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Damn it.

473
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Hey.

474
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,120
We were just fooling around.

475
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,040
What?

476
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,720
What the fuck is this?

477
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,560
You acted all cool and easy.

478
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Look.

479
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,320
Would you date a girl like you?

480
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,840
A girl like me?

481
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,800
What do you mean?

482
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,800
What kind of girl am I?

483
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,600
Tell it to me straight.

484
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,600
What kind of girl am I?

485
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,720
You flashed your breasts
in front of the whole class.

486
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,760
You're a club rat who's famous at school
for changing boyfriends all the time.

487
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,480
What crazy bastard

488
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,160
would want to date

489
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,000
a slut like you?

490
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,760
You little…

491
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,000
-God damn it!
-Get a towel.

492
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,640
-Damn it!
-Are you okay?

493
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,240
Hey.

494
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,280
Itaewon? Right now?

495
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,600
I feel like shit.

496
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,440
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

497
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,080
Just come. I'm going to Itaewon tonight.

498
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,560
Drink slowly.
I'll be there after I meet someone.

499
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
Just come to Itaewon right now.

500
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,200
<i>I'll drink till you come.</i>

501
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,240
<i>-Hurry up.</i>
-What the hell is all this shit?

502
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,240
I'll be there soon.

503
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,480
Go do this shit somewhere far away.
Not at school.

504
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,640
What are you doing? You have no right.

505
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
What right?

506
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,520
Fucking bastards.
Think only you have rights?

507
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,920
What about our rights?
We have to fucking see this.

508
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,960
You have no right to show hatred.

509
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
Assholes have no brains.

510
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,840
Son of a bitch. What did you call me?

511
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,560
You ass-fucking bastards.

512
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,800
-What's your problem?
-Let go!

513
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,440
-Let's talk!
-Who the fuck are you?

514
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
Get lost, you fucking faggot.

515
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,720
Fucking bastard!

516
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,880
You bastards!

517
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,440
Fuck off, bastard!

518
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,800
Just fuck off.

519
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,440
Die, you bastard!

520
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,120
SISTER HEUNG-JA

521
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,720
He said he loved me.

522
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,760
That he only had eyes for me.

523
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,200
Why did he even say that?

524
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,360
I trusted him.

525
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,680
I really did.

526
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Hey.

527
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,400
Why isn't he answering?

528
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,000
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

529
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Are you with someone?

530
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,840
He's on his way.

531
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm a top priority for him.

532
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,560
What?

533
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,720
I said I'm a top priority for him.
He'll be here.

534
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,400
He'll be here.

535
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,720
Why did you lie?

536
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,960
You said it was a guitar club.

537
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,640
So you'd come.

538
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,880
It's none of my business what you think.

539
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,040
I don't want to be called names,
so count me out.

540
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Jeez.

541
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,840
You look like that actor
with a sleek part in his hair.

542
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,520
He was in <i>Happy Together.</i>

543
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,920
The handsome one

544
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,120
with glaring eyes.

545
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,840
Leslie Cheung?

546
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,760
No, Tony Leung.

547
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,520
You're crazy.
You need glasses and a brain scan.

548
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,480
I think I do.

549
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,560
He's still not here.

550
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,680
You said you were his top priority.

551
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,080
Damn it.

552
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,520
Can't you ever knock?

553
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,120
DON'T FORGET TO APPLY THIS

554
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,800
Why didn't you take out the food waste?

555
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,080
I'll throw it out tomorrow.

556
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,320
It stinks out there!

557
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,400
Why are you yelling?

558
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,800
It was your turn to take out the trash.

559
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,400
Why didn't you keep your promise?

560
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,920
I said I'll do it tomorrow.

561
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,440
Wash your hair in the bathroom.
I thought it was a damn rat.

562
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,480
And stop using my razor
to shave your legs.

563
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,440
There's hair everywhere! It's gross!

564
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,280
What about you? You used my BB cream.

565
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,800
You drank my yogurt for constipation!
Why did you drink it all?!

566
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,040
You cheap bastard!

567
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,880
"Cheap"?

568
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,440
-You constipated twerp.
-What?

569
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,560
Damn it. Let go.

570
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,720
Let go, or else…

571
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,640
Or else what?

572
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,600
Why you!

573
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,920
Jerk. Is love more important to you
than friendship?

574
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,400
What the hell do you mean?

575
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,000
You promised you'd come.

576
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,000
But you didn't come!

577
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,040
I waited for you all night!

578
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,320
Think I'm a sucker who has to console you
whenever you fight with a guy?

579
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,760
I had my reasons for not coming!

580
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,720
Damn it. Why's everyone
taking their anger out on me?

581
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
Damn it.

582
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,280
What is it? Did something happen?

583
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,120
What asshole did this to you?

584
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,560
Who the fuck hurt you?

585
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,480
In ninth grade,
I had a crush on an older guy.

586
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,320
I wrote a story for the first time
to give to him.

587
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,720
You've been writing stories all this time?

588
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
I thought I'd go crazy if I didn't write.

589
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,840
<i>I had put our names in the story.</i>

590
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,360
<i>There was a part</i>
<i>where we kissed outside my house.</i>

591
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,000
<i>And my mom read that.</i>

592
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
And?

593
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,320
She didn't say anything.

594
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,680
Acted as if nothing had happened.

595
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,400
But since then,
she started going to church diligently.

596
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,480
It drove me nuts whenever she came at dawn
and prayed for me.

597
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,560
But I think she might have gone crazy
if she didn't do that.

598
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,080
So I stayed still.

599
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,840
Did you want to die?

600
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,640
No.

601
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,680
I just didn't want to live.

602
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,720
In middle school,

603
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,720
we had to draw a milk carton
for art class.

604
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,440
<i>Only 1 out of 30 students</i>
<i>drew a squashed milk carton.</i>

605
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,440
<i>The teacher complimented the student,</i>

606
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,000
said it was the first time
anyone had drawn a crushed carton.

607
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,840
Sounds like a cool teacher.

608
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,480
Yeah, he was cool.

609
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,120
<i>He hung the drawing</i>
<i>at the back of the classroom</i>

610
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,840
<i>and complimented it a lot.</i>

611
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,600
The kid who drew that
must've become an artist.

612
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,480
No, she became an outcast.

613
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,080
<i>The other kids</i>
<i>always filled her locker with rotten milk.</i>

614
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,480
<i>She eventually dropped out.</i>

615
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,600
<i>That's life.</i>

616
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,200
People feel better when they think
those who are different are inferior.

617
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,480
They don't know
that's an inferiority complex.

618
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,320
Fucking stupid.

619
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,520
Yeah. Fuck them.

620
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
What is this?

621
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,080
What are you doing?

622
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
Hey.

623
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,200
Wake up.

624
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,840
Come on. Wake up.

625
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,560
Hey.

626
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,320
What the hell is this?

627
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,360
Why do we have tattoos?

628
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,440
You don't remember last night?

629
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,160
I know.

630
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,200
-Heung-soo.
-Hey.

631
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,000
You're my brother, you know?

632
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,600
No matter what, I'm on your side. Got it?

633
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,320
If you do it, I'll do it.

634
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,840
-Understood?
-Let's do it.

635
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,920
Babe, say hi to my buddy.

636
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,120
He's my best friend in the whole world.

637
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,080
-Hello.
-My bestie.

638
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,680
But you avoided my calls.

639
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,880
Fuck. Stop it.

640
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,840
Don't hurt him, okay?

641
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,440
He's a crybaby.

642
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,880
-Stay still! Hold him!
-Don't move!

643
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,560
Don't move! Hang in there!

644
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,400
Hey!

645
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,720
You're Koo Jae-hee, so "JH" works for you.
But what about me?

646
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,840
I'm JHS. I gotta go back for the "S."

647
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
You can't.

648
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,280
He said he'd kill you if he saw you again.

649
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,200
What? Why?

650
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,160
Before he could tattoo the "S,"

651
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,360
you told him you texted him
pretending to be Ji-eun.

652
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,800
He was my ex…

653
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,280
Don't go back there
unless you want a hole in your wrist.

654
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,640
<i>After suffering from inflammation</i>
<i>and pain from the tattoo,</i>

655
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,440
<i>I had to give up on the "S."</i>

656
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,640
You planning on eating dumplings
all your life?

657
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,200
Your dad loved dumplings.

658
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,360
You still think of him?

659
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,120
Of course. Every time I look at you.

660
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,120
Your dad was also good at making me flip.

661
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,040
That's why I called him the flipper.

662
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,560
Your cousin passed
the civil service written exam.

663
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,880
His interview is in two days.

664
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,920
Didn't he major in art?

665
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,800
What a waste of his degree.

666
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,400
I'm glad he came around.

667
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,200
50% of applicants fail the interview.

668
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,880
And civil servants don't have it easy
these days.

669
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,840
Heung-soo.

670
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,080
Go join the army.
They have good food these days.

671
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,040
Why do you keep telling me
to join the army?

672
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,560
Hi.

673
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,080
<i>Heung-soo…</i>

674
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,840
Ms. Koo Jae-hee?

675
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,960
Please come in.

676
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,200
Relax, please.
I'm going to pull your skirt up.

677
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,040
TO GUCCI:
SORRY. CAN'T MEET TODAY

678
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,600
Ms. Koo's guardian? Please come in.

679
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,760
How frustrating!

680
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,720
-Can you come in?
-Why don't you understand?

681
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,960
-Me?
-Yes. Hurry.

682
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,240
This is the result of your actions.

683
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,680
I said I'd take responsibility.
Just tell me if you'll do it or not.

684
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,920
You call this being responsible?

685
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,760
A woman's body is a sacred temple!

686
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,280
I can't take this anymore!

687
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,080
Jae-hee, calm down.

688
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,480
Jae-hee.

689
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,760
-You irresponsible jerk!
-Doctor!

690
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,760
-It's not mine!
-Go get her!

691
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,760
Excuse me.

692
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,120
-You can't just leave!
-Jae-hee.

693
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,800
<i>Jae-hee was a sprinter</i>
<i>until middle school.</i>

694
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,200
You can't just leave…

695
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,320
Forget what old-fashioned people
have to say.

696
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,920
Give me that. I'll return it.

697
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,960
Give it to me. Let's go to another clinic.

698
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,880
Let go. What's with you?

699
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,840
Am I that easy?

700
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,520
Jae-hee…

701
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,160
Sun-woo said no one would want to date
someone like me.

702
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,120
That doctor said
this is the result of my lifestyle.

703
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,560
Are they right?

704
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,240
So they call me a slapper and a slut.

705
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,120
Is it okay for them to call me that?

706
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,400
Just because I'm easy,

707
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,640
they think they can treat me like shit
and I won't get hurt?

708
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,080
Why do they judge and curse me?

709
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,080
Why is it so easy for them?

710
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,880
How can they judge me so easily?

711
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,360
When I…

712
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,920
I…

713
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,800
I don't even know who I am.

714
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,920
How can they do it?

715
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,800
Heung-soo…

716
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,680
I'm scared.

717
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,800
I'm so scared.

718
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,760
What now?

719
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,000
What am I gonna do?

720
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,960
<i>Jae-hee went on to do a double major</i>
<i>in Business and French</i>

721
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,920
<i>and prepared hard to get a job.</i>

722
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,800
I won a small literary contest.

723
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,480
<i>-I continued to write and enter contests.</i>
-You won?

724
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,240
Congrats. Why didn't you tell me?

725
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,880
It's nothing serious.
The prize isn't much.

726
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,760
<i>Rumors spread of us living together</i>
<i>and of her having an abortion.</i>

727
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,120
<i>And Jae-hee and I realized</i>
<i>how powerful collective intelligence was.</i>

728
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,280
If you keep living like this,
you'll die of loneliness, man.

729
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,360
Fuck!

730
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,240
I know.

731
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,800
I think I'll die that way too.

732
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,080
Go meet some nice guy and be happy.

733
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,440
<i>There's nothing between us.</i>
<i>It was just sex.</i>

734
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,120
You're overreacting.
We just slept together a few times.

735
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,480
Damn you, jerk.

736
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,720
You don't know what love is,
you hopeless stupid jerk.

737
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,560
Come on. Let's go.

738
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,240
Let's drink without him.

739
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,360
What's your name?

740
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,840
<i>He's totally into you.</i>

741
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,080
It's about time
you started dating seriously.

742
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Then what?

743
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,320
Get married, and introduce him to my mom?

744
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,960
"Mom, meet my boyfriend.
Nice, huh? He's got good balls."

745
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,360
That's gross.

746
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,400
Heung-soo,

747
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,640
should we just live together
like this forever?

748
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,320
I'd rather raise a dog.

749
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,800
Really? I can be more like a dog.

750
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,480
No more, please.

751
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,680
<i>Soon after,</i>
<i>Jae-hee left to study in Australia.</i>

752
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,040
<i>She said school wasn't fun without me.</i>

753
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,280
DEAR HEUNG-SOO,
WRITING TO MY BELOVED…

754
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,720
<i>Su-ho sent me letters regularly</i>
<i>in Jae-hee's name.</i>

755
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,680

01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,120
Hey! You're back!

759
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,640
I've been discharged, ma'am.

760
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,600
-You dressed for a funeral?
-Want me to send you to yours.

761
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,080
I'm not going anywhere.

762
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,880
I'm hungry. What shall we eat?

763
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,160
You pick. My treat.

764
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
Hey, you!

765
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,720
-Yes?
-Come here.

766
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,360
Come this way, please.

767
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,640
Attention, everyone.

768
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,760
Our long-awaited new recruits
are here at last.

769
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,520
Attention.

770
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,920
All bow.

771
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,840
Nice to meet you.

772
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,800
-Hello!
-Welcome!

773
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,200
Hello.

774
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,640
I'm subbing for the owner.
What would you like?

775
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,480
A shot of tequila, please.

776
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,600
-Jose Cuervo?
-Sure.

777
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,960
Do you come here often?

778
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,440
Well, I guess.

779
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,000
I live nearby.

780
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,680
Are you a student?

781
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,000
Yes.

782
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,040
I envy you.
Students can do anything they want.

783
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

784
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,440
Damn.

785
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,720
Let's get a quick drink
and get out of here.

786
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,680
Why?

787
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,520
To buy a gun to shoot my manager.

788
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,560
ATTORNEY KIM JI-SEOK

789
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,000
If you shoot him, call me.

OPEN RECRUITMENT

791
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,240
COVER LETTER

792
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,920
<i>In Search of Lost Time?</i>

793
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,760
The writer focuses
only on humans with great dedication.

794
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,720
<i>That kind of persistence…</i>

795
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,080
<i>It's a work that you experience,</i>
<i>not just read.</i>

796
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
<i>By the way,</i>

797
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,480
why did you apply to our company?

798
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,160
You don't seem keen to be here.

799
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,640
<i>When you're going in the wrong direction,</i>
<i>your speed doesn't matter.</i>

800
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,840
My manager always makes us
do the work all over again.

801
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,360
Why can't he be clear about what he wants?
Am I supposed to read his mind?

802
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,120
That's because you're not skilled enough.

803
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,720
That's not it.

804
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,720
He always tells me to do it on my own,
then gives me a hard time.

805
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,680
Adjusting to your boss's style of working
is part of the job.

806
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,720
So, you two must meet up often.

807
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,400
Well…

808
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,640
No.

809
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,080
Maybe just a couple of times
since he showed up drunk at my house.

810
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,560
Why would Heung-soo's friend
show up drunk at your place?

811
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,320
-Well--
-We had a group meeting.

812
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,400
That's right.

813
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,360
We spent all night
making a PPT at my place.

814
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,360
Heung-soo fell asleep,
and he showed up drunk.

815
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,440
Why would you have a group meeting
at your place with just guys?

816
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,000
They're my friends.

817
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,400
And Ji-eun was there too.

818
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,560
Ji-eun, right. Why not ask her to join us?

819
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,200
She's a vegetarian.

820
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,680
When we went for gourmet salad,
you said she was a meat-lover.

821
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,600
Well…

822
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,480
She stopped eating meat since then.

823
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
She has fatty liver.

824
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,920
The mysterious Ji-eun!

825
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,960
She never leaves home. Is she a cat?

826
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,360
At least cats make noises.

827
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,560
I never heard her once
while we were on the phone.

828
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,400
That's 'cause it's impolite to be noisy
when someone's on the phone.

829
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,720
She's a quiet girl.

830
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,440
I think we need some wine with the meat.

831
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,520
Why aren't you drinking?

832
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,200
No, thanks.
I got to go to court in the morning.

833
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,960
Jae-hee, you should stop drinking too.

834
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,000
You have to prepare for your meeting.

835
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,680
He takes good care of me.

836
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,960
He's totally obsessed with her.

837
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,840
She said no, but he kept chasing her.

838
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,560
He flips out
if she doesn't take his calls.

839
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,400
He must like her a lot.

840
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,960
Obsession is a form of love.

841
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,480
How is that love? It's a mental illness.

842
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,560
Heung-soo, I've made my decision.

843
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,320
I'm going to come out properly.

844
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,600
I already told my sister.

845
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,880
She wasn't as surprised
as I thought she'd be.

846
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,600
She said she had a feeling.

847
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,200
Just go.

848
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,160
We're done for good.

849
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,840
It's that easy
for you to break up with me?

850
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,360
If you come out, and I'm with you,
where does that leave me?

851
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,680
Did you think about that?

852
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,560
About what it would do to me?

853
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,080
All the things that are to come…

854
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,480
You really think you can handle it?

855
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,160
Look…

856
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,360
Listen, Heung-soo…

857
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,120
What hurts even more
than people cursing me

858
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,840
is the wall you put up between us.

859
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,360
Let's call it quits then.

860
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Fine.

861
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,560
Let's not meet again.

862
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,320
I'm tired of this.

863
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,800
It's pretty.

864
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,480
Try it on.

865
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,680
I can't wear this to work.

866
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,280
Wear it when you're going out then.

867
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,960
Why don't you wear heels these days?

868
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,320
Ji-seok hates me looking taller than him.

869
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,800
Tell him to grow taller.

870
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,320
Why do you do everything he wants?

871
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,640
You're no fun these days, you know?

872
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,080
You're a bore.

873
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,080
He proposed to me.

874
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,640
He's getting up there in age.

875
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,320
I said I'd think about it.

876
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,640
But I like my job,

877
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,680
and I don't know
if I want to get married right now.

878
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,960
I think you want to get married,
but you're not sure about him.

879
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,640
I shouldn't get married
because everyone else does, right?

880
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,720
And you don't have to get a job
just 'cause everyone else does.

881
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,840
Go to grad school for writing.

882
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,800
I haven't seen you write
since you came back from the army.

883
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,840
You know what's the saddest thing
in the world?

884
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,359
A poor gay guy.

885
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,720
I'm going to make money.

886
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,720
You're lucky you're good at something.

887
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,279
What a waste of potential.

AUTHOR PARK SANG-YOUNG

889
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,240
<i>Hey.</i>

890
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:40,439
<i>Come home.</i>

891
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,720
<i>Hurry up!</i>

892
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,760
<i>Your mom is here!</i>

893
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,600
Mom, what are you doing here?

894
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,480
You said to send over your winter clothes.
Thought I'd drop them off myself.

895
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,400
I wanted to see your place,
and also bring you some kimchi.

896
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,920
Listen, Mom. She's--

897
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I know.

898
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:17,920
Your best friend.

899
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,400
He never tells me anything about school.

900
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,560
I had no idea he had such a close friend.

901
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,800
Now that you're working at a good company,
please help Heung-soo out too.

902
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,360
Don't worry, ma'am.

903
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,920
A fortune teller told me

904
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,680
that any man who's with me
will be very successful.

905
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,640
-Oh, really?
-Yes, ma'am.

906
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,560
For sure.

907
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,760
Eat up.

908
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,200
I saved you the leg piece.

909
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,160
Here.

910
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,520
It's so nice
to have your home-cooked meal.

911
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,120
Want to go to my place?

912
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,280
Can I really?

913
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,440
It's okay. I have a parttime job.

914
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,600
Buy some meat.
It'll give you energy to study harder.

915
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,560
Buy good food for Jae-hee too.

916
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:06,800
Heung-soo,

917
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,040
I knew you'd be cured.

918
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,000
What is it? Is the boiler broken?

919
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,040
Yeah.

920
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,240
Sleep here then.

921
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,840
That's okay.

922
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,640
You don't have a heating pad.

923
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Your mom seems nice.

924
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,200
Very sweet.

925
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,160
She thinks you're pretty.

926
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,000
Must be going blind.

927
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,200
JI-SEOK

928
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,440
Slept well, handsome?

929
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,920
Jae-hee,

930
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,880
did you eat poop?

931
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,560
Hey. Get off me.

932
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,440
I won't. Your back is so warm.

933
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,560
Come on.

934
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,160
Get off me. What's gotten into you
this morning? Seriously!

935
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,480
-That damn temper of yours.
-Damn it!

936
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,200
Go get the milk.

937
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,120
Did you gain weight?

938
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,640
-No way.
-You're heavier.

939
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,160
Maybe it's because you're constipated.
Drink some milk.

940
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,120
Ji-seok?

941
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,720
-Damn you!
-I can explain.

942
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,200
You son of a bitch!

943
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,800
-Ji-seok! No!
-You bastard!

944
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,320
Ji-seok, let me explain!

945
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,800
Listen to me, please!

946
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,800
Stay out of this!

947
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,120
Hey!

948
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,400
Are you okay?

949
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,160
I'm fine.

950
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,440
-Get your hands off my girl, asshole!
-You…

951
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,720
Stop! He's gay!

952
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,120
Heung-soo is gay. He likes men.

953
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,120
He's Ji-eun.

954
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,880
It's the same as living with a woman.

955
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,600
Ji-eun?

956
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,200
You're really gay?

957
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,280
Let's go out.

958
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,800
Let's talk outside. Let's go!

959
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,760
Are you gay? Answer me!

960
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,120
-I'll explain everything.
-Let go!

961
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,600
Are you really gay?! Move!

962
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,200
I'm sorry I lied.

963
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,960
You didn't just lie. You scammed me.

964
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,200
Either he goes, or I go.

965
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,760
Do you think this makes any sense?

966
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,280
Fine.

967
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,240
I'll talk to Heung-soo.

968
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,960
Give me some time.

969
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,800
Why do you need time?
Just cut the bastard off!

970
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,840
You're close with Young-ho.
He means the world to you.

971
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,680
You said you'd give him
your liver and kidney if he needed it.

972
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,640
Heung-soo is like that for me.

973
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,120
It's not the same.

974
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,160
How can you be so stupid?

975
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,960
-They're completely different things.
-Please.

976
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,080
Just cut ties with the faggot!

977
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,520
You're laughing?

978
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,280
You think this is funny?

979
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,400
You see,

980
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,640
I like iced coffee.

981
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,040
What are you talking about?

982
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,360
I think we should break up.

983
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,480
Fucker.

984
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,120
What?

985
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
Hey!

986
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,360
I'm sorry.

987
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,800
I didn't mean to do that.

988
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,520
Then what did you mean?

989
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,200
Are you mad at me?

990
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,200
No. Why would I be mad?
I am gay, aren't I?

991
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,200
You smile when you're mad.

992
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,480
Why ask if you already know?

993
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,080
You know,

994
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,760
I haven't told my mom.

995
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,400
I haven't even told my own mother.

996
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,840
How could you tell that bastard?

997
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,680
I wanted him to stop hitting you--

998
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,000
You should've let him hit me
instead of making me feel like shit.

999
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,280
-I understand you--
-Who are you to understand me?

1000
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,840
Because you're normal?
What, you're ordinary?

1001
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,640
Cut the crap and admit you don't care
because it's not about you.

1002
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,760
At least be honest about it.

1003
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,720
How long will you keep hiding it?
Will you only hang out with me forever?

1004
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,920
Graduation, writing, your life.

1005
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,680
How long will you push people away
and hide from them?

1006
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,240
If I had rich parents like yours,
I wouldn't be living like this!

1007
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,760
You live like this and act all cool

1008
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:52,000
because you have something
to fall back on.

1009
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,160
What are you trying to say?

1010
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,000
Stop being dragged around by men,
and live your life properly.

1011
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,200
This is not you.

1012
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,800
You think you're the saddest
and most pitiful thing in the world?

1013

In love,
you gotta take off the protective film.

1016
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,920

Thank you, Father.

In this chaotic world,

1036
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,600
thank you for guiding this lamb

1037
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,800
Mom,

01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,440
I'm gay.

1039
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,680
Mom, I…

1040
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,400
I'm in love…

1041
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,200
with a man.

1042
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,400
Heading out?

1043
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,280
Where are you going?

1044
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,360
To watch a movie.

1045
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,480
At this hour?

1046
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,760
By yourself?

1047
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,040
Mom?

1048
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,040
Mom!

1049
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,040
Are you in here?

1050

What's wrong?

1054
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,240
Wake up, Mom!

01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,920
Did you drink raspberry wine?

1066
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,760
<i>Was she stabbed?</i>

1067
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,880
<i>Hello?</i>

1068
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,760
<i>Give me the address. We'll be right there.</i>

1069
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,720
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

1070
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,560
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1071
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,120
<i>Can you hear me? Hello?</i>

1072
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,000
She's okay. I'm so sorry.

1073
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,360
RASPBERRY WINE

1074
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,880
I'm sorry.

1075
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,840
By any chance, is he…

1076
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,400
Tony Leung is here.

1077
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,080
Tony Leung? Don't be absurd.

1078
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,480
<i>How have you been?</i>

1079
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,400
It's been a while.

1080
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:36,960
You look good.

1081
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,200
You too.

1082
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,280
I was thinking about calling you.

1083
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,560
I have something to say.

1084
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,880
Really? What?

1085
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,560
What did you come to say?

1086
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,800
It's nothing important.

1087
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:02,960
You go first.

1088
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,640
I'm seeing someone.

1089
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,760
You met him at my office.

1090
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,080
Oh, right.

1091
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,280
Him?

1092
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,320
That's great.

1093
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,560
Congratulations.

1094
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,800
I wanted to tell you.

1095
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,560
I thought I should.

1096
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,280
I'll get going.

1097
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,480
Did you hear the chief fart?

1098
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,920
It was so funny.

1099
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I heard it too.

1100
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,640
Young-woo, don't laugh like that.

1101
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:14,600
It's so gay.

1102
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,600
What's so gay about it?

1103
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,400
You were joking, right?

1104
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,440
Why would you joke
about something like that?

1105
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,200
What's wrong with being gay?

1106
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,640
Tell me.

1107
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,520
Jae-hee, are you drunk?

1108
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,800
What's your problem? Young-woo laughed.

1109
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,560
That doesn't make it okay.

1110
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:43,360
Some people just laugh it off
because they don't want to make it awkward

1111
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,120
or don't know how to get angry.

1112
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,840
So stupid.

1113
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,320
Come on, why are you getting serious?

1114
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,280
Why get worked up
over something so trivial?

1115
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,200
Don't say it's trivial. Please!

1116
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,880
Can't you see
it clearly means something to me?

1117
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,720
Please excuse me.

1118
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,800
Ms. Koo.

1119
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,880
Here.

1120
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,400
Let me get you a cab.
It's unsafe at night for women.

1121
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,640
Why don't you go home early too?

1122
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,000
If men went home early,
women would be safer at night.

1123
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,440
That's genius.

1124
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,920
Heung-soo!

1125
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,520
The door code was both your birthdays?

1126
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,600
How cute.

1127
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,240
Are you drunk?

1128
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,800
I thought long and hard about it.

1129
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,800
That bastard's not gay.

1130
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,560
You cheated on me and lied about it,
didn't you?

1131
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,880
You're drunk.

1132
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,400
Let's talk when you're sober.

1133
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,640
You two played me for a fool, didn't you?!

1134
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,280
Jae-hee.

1135
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,800
It's okay, babe.

1136
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,880
I'll forgive you for everything
because I love you, Jae-hee.

1137
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,680
I forgive you. Let's start over.

1138
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,720
No.

1139
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:53,880
What?

1140
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,320
I don't want to.

1141
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,200
Now get out of my house.

1142
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,440
You fucking bitch!

1143
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,360
You slut!

1144
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,320
I said, I'd forgive you!

1145
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,280
Why?!

1146
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:34,960
Damn it!

1147
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,320
You little…

1148
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,720
<i>The line is busy. After the beep…</i>

1149
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,880
SISTER HEUNG-JA

1150
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,480
ASSHOLE KIM JI-SEOK

1151
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,680
<i>Hello?</i>

1152
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,400
Heung-soo.

1153
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,320
Where are you? What's wrong?

1154
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,360
Jae-hee.

1155
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,400
Go to the police. I'll be right there.

1156
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
<i>Jae-hee, focus and stop crying.</i>

1157
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,240
I'll be right there, okay?

1158
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,680
Okay?!

1159
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:31,520
-Go!
-Pass back!

1160
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,320
Goal!

1161
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,960
Take this left. It's faster.

1162
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,560
Wait. Stop here.

1163
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,920
Mister, stop!

1164
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,120
Kim Ji-seok!

1165
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,080
Come out, you bastard!

1166
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,520
Fuck.

1167
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,600
What is it?

1168
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,120
Vandalism and assault.

1169
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,200
I'm the victim here!

1170
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,520
You look like a duck in a thunderstorm.

1171
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,440
So do you.

1172
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,120
I will sue these bastards!

1173
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,000
-I'm a lawyer!
-You son of a bitch!

1174
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,080
Officer, I saw them naked
and stuck together like glue.

1175
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,040
My girlfriend
was secretly living with a man.

1176
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,800
They lied to me for years.

1177
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,720
What man would not lose it?

1178
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,640
And he beat me up.
Do you see what he's done to my face?

1179
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:00,960
That's bad.

1180
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,880
That's terrible. How could you?

1181
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,560
Yes. He hit me black and blue.

1182
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,440
When I caught them in the act,
do you know what they said to me?

1183
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,520
They said they're just friends.

1184
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,960
She said he's gay.

1185
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,400
Hey. Are you really gay?

1186
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:18,040
If you are, prove it to us.

1187
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,920
Show me a picture
of you having sex with a guy.

1188
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,920
You bastard!

1189
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,440
-Go on! Hit me!
-You shit!

1190
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,520
Settle down! Please be quiet!

1191
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,840
Calm down. Please sit down.

1192
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,000
Let me get this straight.

1193
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:36,000
Your girlfriend
was living secretly with this man.

1194
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,600
She lied that he's gay,
and he assaulted you?

1195
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,680
That's right.

1196
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,280
Is this true?

1197
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,760
Answer him!

1198
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,600
You cheated on me!

1199
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,440
-Yes, I'm a slut!
-Yes, I'm gay!

1200
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,560
You're not a slut, Jae-hee.

1201
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,240
It's true, I'm gay.

1202
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,160
Fuck.

1203
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,120
Jae-hee and I are friends.

1204
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,800
She knows everything about me.

1205
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,160
And I know her
better than anyone else does!

1206
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,040
And she's no slut.

1207
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:15,800
We are just…

1208
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,840
Even my mom knows that we're best friends.

1209
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,240
Best friends live together.

1210
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,400
And rent is so damn expensive in Seoul!

1211
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,960
People may think

1212
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,280
it's weird that we live together.

1213
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,440
I get it.

1214
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,720
But it's not weird for us.

1215
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,880
Are we weird?

1216
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,480
No.

1217
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,000
Not at all.

1218
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:58,240
Bravo!

1219
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,360
That's not weird.

1220
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,440
Fuck.

1221
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,480
Bless you.

1222
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,920
EMERGENCY ROOM

1223
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:13,320
Be careful.

1224
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,080
Let's sit down.

1225
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,720
I should've listened to you.
I'm always getting into trouble like this.

1226
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,440
That's who you are.

1227
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:36,160
You go at things without fear,
fall down, but you get back up again.

1228
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,800
The most carefree girl in the world.

1229
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,720
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

1230
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,000
Koo Jae-hee, how can being yourself
possibly be a weakness?

1231
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,480
Damn it!

1232
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,360
It's cold.

1233
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,040
Jae-hee.

1234
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:03,360
Su-ho is gone.

1235
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,800
He has a boyfriend now.

1236
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,920
I thought…

1237
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,120
he'd always be there.

1238
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,080
Because he always was.

1239
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,640
So I never once told him

1240
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,840
that I missed him.

1241
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,760
I miss him.

1242
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,360
Just cry, silly.

1243
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,760
Let it all out.

1244
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,360
You didn't hear me?

1245
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,800
The meeting's in 20 minutes,
and you say you didn't hear?

1246
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,800
-Where's Chief Jang?
-Here, sir.

1247
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,840
Come here.

1248
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,440
Jang Jung-woo,
did you tell her what I told you or not?

1249
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,240
I did, sir.

1250
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,240
You did?

1251
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,320
Then look at this.

1252
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,240
Look!

1253
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,320
Apparently you didn't.

1254
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:42,000
I'm canceling today's presentation.
Fix it by tomorrow. Got it?

1255
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,080
Yes, sir.

1256
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,760
Damn it.

1257
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:49,160
-Chief, I swear I didn't hear.
-I told you!

1258
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,200
I clearly said it
during our meeting yesterday.

1259
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,800
Redo it quickly and send it to me.

1260
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,920
How are we supposed to know
what they talked about?

1261
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,920
I asked them to tell us,
but they ignored me.

1262
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,400
I should learn to smoke too. Damn it.

1263
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,680
-But they'll curse me for that too.
-Right.

1264
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:11,000
I'm so upset. When will we ever get
the right instructions?

1265
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:15,120
Do I still have to get yelled at
by the manager for stuff like this?

1266
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,160
Do your jobs properly.

1267
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,040
You saw what happened earlier, right?

1268
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:25,320
Make sure you double-check the files
before submitting them.

1269
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,800
And make the fonts bigger.

1270
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,800
Last time, the executives complained--

1271
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,880
This must be the meeting room.
I had no idea.

1272
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,120
Why didn't you tell me?

1273
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,880
We could have avoided
that little incident today.

1274
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,920
Right, Chief?

1275
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,760
Now that I know,

1276
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,560
I won't miss anything.

1277
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,120
It's nice out here.

1278
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,320
Are we having meetings here now?

1279
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:57,440
I guess we were in the wrong place
all this time.

1280
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,880
-Too bad.
-I know, right?

1281
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,000
That was awesome.
Did you see the look on his face?

1282
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:09,720
<i>Don't say I'm old</i>

1283
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:14,160
<i>I feel so young at heart</i>

1284
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:27,720
This is so much fun.

1285
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,800
Since I'm in a good mood,
I'll say just one thing.

1286
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,920
The new employees these days

1287
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,080
spend all their energy
looking for other jobs.

1288
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,280
So when they come in to work,
they have no energy left.

1289
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,840
Back in my day…

1290
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,840
Get out of the way.

1291
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,440
Yes, sir. You can sit here.

1292
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,640
I don't like her.

1293
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,920
I'm telling you.

1294
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,760
I get why the manager hates her.

1295
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:37,200
Her nickname is NTJ.

1296
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,920
"No tomorrow Jae-hee."

1297
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:41,800
Damn!

1298
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,720
She's pretty.

1299
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,520
And cool.

1300
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,720
Really cool.

1301
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,360
I like her so much. What do I do?

1302
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:56,720
Don't know.

1303
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,880
I just came out for a smoke.

1304
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,840
I should…

1305
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:07,520
I got to go.

1306
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,000
But why?

1307
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,920
Why do you have to get married,
of all things?

1308
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,160
After three years,
there's nothing to do but get married.

1309
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,640
I told you I want to try everything--

1310
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:36,600
Yes, you did. I get that.

1311
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:37,960
But marriage--

1312
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,160
What is it?

1313
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:41,720
Are you hurt?

1314
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,240
Is that from Mama's Boy?

1315
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,720
My God!

1316
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,440
-Try it on.
-It'll suit you.

1317
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,000
-It suits you perfectly.
-It stretches, you know?

1318
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,880
-Try it on.
-Let's throw it out.

1319
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:07,880
So?

1320
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,760
Are you the top priority for him?

1321
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,440
MIN-JOON

1322
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:26,720
Hi, honey.

1323
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,360
Yes, I was just packing.

1324
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,760
Heung-soo is helping me.

1325
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,800
Yes. Really?

1326
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,360
-So pretty.
-I know.

1327
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,520
She looks beautiful.

1328
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:26,720
So pretty!

1329
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,600
Next up is the wedding song.

1330
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,400
Thanks.

1331
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:53,120
Yes, the wedding song
will be sung by Jae-hee's dearest friend.

1332
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,080
Please welcome Jang Heung-soo.

1333
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:03,760
Jae-hee…

1334
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,040
Have a good life.

1335
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:26,960
<i>You don't know me</i>
<i>You don't know me</i>

1336
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,560
<i>So shut up, boy</i>

1337
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:33,320
<i>So shut up, boy</i>
<i>So shut up, shut up</i>

1338
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,680
<i>You couldn't say a thing in front of me</i>

1339
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,880
<i>But you badmouth me behind my back</i>

1340
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,800
<i>Jeez</i>

1341
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,320
<i>I'm dumbfounded</i>

1342
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:49,040
<i>Hello, hello, hello</i>

1343
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:52,640
<i>Meeting a girl like me</i>

1344
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,000
<i>Must be your first time</i>

1345
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,120
<i>Why do you judge me?</i>

1346
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:00,480
<i>Are you afraid of me?</i>

1347
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,960
<i>On the outside, I'm a bad girl</i>
<i>On the inside, I'm a good girl</i>

1348
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,400
<i>You don't even know me</i>

1349
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,600
<i>You only look at my appearance</i>

1350
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:10,480
<i>And think I'm a pitiful girl</i>

1351
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,760
<i>Your gaze is so funny to me</i>

1352
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,240
<i>When I dance, I'm a bad girl</i>
<i>When I love, I'm a good girl</i>

1353
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:21,320
<i>When you watch me dance</i>
<i>You become mesmerized</i>

1354
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,520
<i>But then you point fingers…</i>

1355
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,480
<i>I get why it's so difficult for parents</i>

1356
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:28,400
<i>to look at their beaming daughter</i>
<i>at her wedding.</i>

1357
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,360
<i>You're more obvious</i>

1358
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,040
<i>Hello, hello, hello</i>

1359
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:46,760
<i>If you don't have the guts,</i>
<i>Go back, go back, go back</i>

1360
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,280
<i>Just step aside</i>

1361
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,560
<i>Why keep yapping?</i>

1362
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:53,840
<i>I can see right through you, you know?</i>

1363
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:58,040
<i>On the outside, I'm a bad girl</i>
<i>On the inside, I'm a good girl</i>

1364
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,840
<i>You don't even know me</i>

1365
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,520
<i>You only look at my appearance</i>

1366
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,280
<i>She came into my life</i>
<i>and recognized me for who I was.</i>

1367
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:16,920
<i>We openly shared our pain,</i>
<i>and gave each other everything we had.</i>

1368
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,920
<i>She remembers all the moments I loved</i>
<i>and how my face glowed then.</i>

1369
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,840
<i>She showed me</i>
<i>that I am enough just as I am.</i>

1370
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,800
<i>The memory drive of my 20s…</i>

1371
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,400
<i>Good-bye, Jae-hee.</i>

1372
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,720
<i>If obsession isn't love,</i>
<i>then I have never loved.</i>

1373
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,920
JAE-HEE

1374
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,840
What? You haven't taken off yet?

1375
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:11,760
<i>I forgot to ask you.</i>
<i>Wanna go on a blind date?</i>

1376
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,200
What? Who is it? Is he good-looking?

1377
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,120
<i>He's a detective. How about it?</i>

1378
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,520
Better than a criminal, I guess.

1379
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,000
<i>Okay, then I'll set it up.</i>

1380
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,480
<i>I got to get on the plane now.</i>
<i>I'll text you later.</i>

1381
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,600
Okay, have a--

1382
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,200
Oh, Koo Jae-hee!

1383
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,960
All right. I'll see you soon.
