162
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,280
She's also an employee of the company.

163
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,690
You won't play favorites, right?

164
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,980
- Hurry, thank the CEO.
- Thank you, CEO!

165
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,620
I feel very sorry towards you, CEO.

166
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,010
- If it weren't for me—
- The CEO would not have gotten hurt.

167
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,100
It's my fault for being clumsy.

168
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,380
How can I be so useless?

169
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,180
Aiyo, I just wanted to gently remind you that

170
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,000
you already said that in the last scene.

171
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,940
Zheng Xiao'en, don't you have any manners?

172
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,620
Geez, can't everyone talk together?

173
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,810
Where's your house? I'll take you back first.

174
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,440
No! (in Korean) That won't do!

175
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
Chuchu is so fragile. We should take her home first.

176
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,230
Anything's fine with me as long as it's convenient for CEO.

177
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,460
Thank you, CEO. You should get some rest.

178
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,630
You go rest now.

179
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,510
Bye bye.

180
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,700
Bye bye.

181
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,280
I haven't even told you where my house is!

182
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,400
You're making me take the bus this late at night?

183
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,690
He's so handsome but so cold-hearted.

184
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm your diehard fan!

185
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,050
Don’t turn me into an anti-fan!

186
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,340
You haven't eaten yet, right? What's wrong?

187
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,810
It's so late.

188
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,720
I'd be fine with Hong Kong-style cafe, but a French restaurant?

189
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,770
Is this reasonable?

190
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,770
Aren't restaurants supposed to be there whenever you want to eat?

191
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,440
Not just French cuisine restaurants, but also Japanese cuisine restaurants,

192
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,820
menu-less restaurants, and Russian restaurants.

193
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,570
They're all still open.

194
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,100
Or do you want to eat freshly delivered sashimi?

195
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,660
I'm fine.

196
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,830
As expected, dreams have everything.

197
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,650
You don't like any of these?

198
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,080
It's not that I don't like it.

199
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,450
It's just that you can eat anything for a midnight snack.

200
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,990
Like NT$100 stir fry or popcorn chicken!

201
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,740
Rice noodle soup. Cold noodles with miso soup.

202
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,950
It feels great to eat those at night.

203
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,740
NT$100 stir fry? What is that?

204
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,510
You've never had NT$100 stir fry before?

205
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,320
It's not that I haven't had it before... I've never even heard of it.

206
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,730
And what's popcorn chicken?

207
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,140
Popcorn chicken is a Taiwanese staple, and you have to eat it with garlic and basil.

208
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,720
It's insane that you've never heard of it.

209
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,970
Is there any place nearby that sells popcorn chicken?

210
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,520
You've also never heard of popcorn chicken?

211
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,680
What about danzai noodles, oyster omelettes, scallion pancakes, red bean cakes, or sponge cakes?

212
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,380
Is it good to drink?

213
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,910
Let's just eat something French tonight.

214
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,980
So it turns out that out of millions of romance novel worlds,

215
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,780
there’s actually one that doesn’t have popcorn chicken?

216
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,710
Sure enough, they’re so poor that all they have is money.

217
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Have you gone crazy with hunger?

218
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Choose whatever you like. I'll pay today.

219
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,510
What a work of art.

220
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,410
Sight, taste, and smell are satisfied all at once.

221
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,350
You should carefully savor it.

222
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,340
Let's eat. I'll start.

223
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,380
You like Aoran, right?

224
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,650
It's not really that I like him.

225
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,890
What about you? You like Chuchu, don't you?

226
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,870
I knew it.

227
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,270
What do you like about Aoran?

228
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,280
Wow!

229
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,040
There's eye candy. Want to take a look?

230
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,910
No! It feels very perverted.

231
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,970
Hurry. Come look!

232
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,360
He's really handsome.

233
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,510
Hurry, hurry!

234
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,790
Fine, fine.

235
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,710
Only three seconds. I'll only look for three seconds.

236
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,980
It's him.

237
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,870
- It's been three seconds.
- Three seconds aren't enough! Thirty seconds.

238
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,570
Who was it that just said this feels perverted?

239
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,070
The words are still ringing in my ears.

240
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,380
Do you feel like you've been slapped in the face?

241
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,550
This is for you. I'll take this.

242
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,540
- So handsome!
- Zheng Xiao'en!

243
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,410
He's really like the male protagonists in our romance novels.

244
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,140
- Zheng Xiao'en!
- What?

245
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,180
I bought that camera drone!

246
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,650
Yours is mine. Mine is still mine.

247
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,110
There's no such thing!

248
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,260
Have you found the CEO?

249
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,630
Yes! Over here!

250
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,020
Hi!

251
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,640
The CEO's winter outfit is also handsome!

252
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,330
From a very long time ago,

253
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,000
he has been like a place of refuge to me.

254
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,690
♫ Almost losing my soul ♫

255
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,010
♫ Silently frozen like a statue ♫

256
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,160
Setbacks. Everyone encounters various setbacks daily.

257
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,890
Including myself, of course.

258
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,730
And... maybe I encounter them more than others do.

259
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,010
Really? Most people have the impression that you are a successful person born from a wealthy family.

260
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,620
You seem to be hardworking and optimistic.

261
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,990
The me that everyone sees is the me that I'm willing to show everyone.

262
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,090
Meaning that you have many other sides that not everyone sees?

263
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,780
Of course.

264
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,100
Just like how you wouldn't show everyone

265
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,990
the images of you sitting on your couch eating a midnight snack, right?

266
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,610
Then how do you face setbacks?

267
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,220
Il faut être l'homme de la pluie

268
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,660
et l'enfant du beau temp.

269
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,990
In a storm, you have to be like an adult.

270
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,160
In beautiful weather, you have to be like a child.

271
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,850
♫ Feel it to your heart's content ♫

272
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,810
♫ Got nothing but time ♫

273
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:04,870
♫ I will accompany you in insomnia ♫

274
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,470
♫ You don't need to face everything alone ♫

275
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,900
In a storm, you have to be like an adult.

276
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,490
♫ No matter how hard the pain is, forever ♫

277
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:24,540
♫ There will be no more parting ♫

278
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,070
Whenever I was in a bad mood, I just had to look at him

279
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,840
to feel like such a person could actually exist in the world,

280
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,940
which would bring me comfort.

281
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,500
It's just that...

282
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,720
♫ Tonight I'm here ♫

283
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,950
In his toughest time, I found out

284
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,020
that I couldn't do anything for him.

285
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,190
When did Aoran ever need you to do something for him?

286
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,580
Anyway, just pretend that I'm talking about a previous life.

287
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,920
Because I owe him from the last lifetime, I need to pay him back in this lifetime.

288
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,010
If not, I don't know why I'm here then.

289
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,550
Do you know that you're really weird?

290
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,480
Just pretend I'm someone who came from outer space then.

291
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,010
What about you?

292
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,970
I was born and raised on Earth.

293
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,190
Who was asking you about that?

294
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,720
I was asking you why you like Chuchu.

295
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,970
Because she's caring, warm, kind, considerate, elegant, and thoughtful.

296
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,710
Also, she's always thinking of others.

297
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,240
Okay, enough.

298
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,120
The reason isn't important.

299
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,640
Since the author wants you to have a crush on her, you do.

300
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,050
I wonder if Situ Aoran... no, He Tianxing

301
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,920
from the real world is doing okay.

302
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,050
Madam, please don't worry. The best doctors in the hospital

303
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,430
have come together to form a specialized team for the chairman.

304
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,650
We will do everything we can to help the chairman.

305
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,110
Then I'll leave him in your care.

306
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,930
Don't worry, Madam.

307
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,580
Zhaonan, they're so noisy, right?

308
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,390
Look at what I'm wearing.

309
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,520
They're this season's newest collection.

310
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,060
This ring and earrings too.

311
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,180
Aren't they beautiful?

312
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,800
After being married to you for so long,

313
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,790
you're the most obedient like this.

314
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,850
In the past, every time I wanted to talk to you,

315
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,070
you would just give me your credit card

316
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,010
and tell me to go shopping and to buy things.

317
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,510
But... no matter what I bought,

318
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,580
you never wanted to know.

319
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,030
I won't hold what happened in the past against you.

320
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,250
You've worked hard your entire life.

321
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,230
Just rest a little.

322
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,710
Quiet down. Your father is resting.

323
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,300
It's not like Dad is sleeping.

324
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,010
Even if I set off firecrackers here, he still wouldn't wake up.

325
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,140
You're right.

326
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:17,120
Oh, right. Did you find Lawyer Wei who helped your dad draft his will?

327
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,380
No.

328
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,220
Ever since Dad collapsed, he took the will and has been in hiding.

329
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,220
Do you have any clues?

330
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,490
I don't know anything about the company.

331
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,230
That's true. Asking you is in vain.

332
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,430
In any case, you only have one task right now.

333
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,890
Until I find the will, take good care of Dad.

334
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,020
Don't let him die.

335
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,630
Nonsense!

336
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,940
Your dad won't die!

337
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,340
Go look into who took the things that were on He Tianxing that day.

338
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,270
Okay.

339
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:18,200
[Tianliang Group]

340
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,940
[Prayer Area]
[He Tianxing, jiayou (a term used to cheer someone on)!]
[CEO, Wake Up]

341
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,720
[You are the best CEO in the world]
[Tianliang Group needs you]

342
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,040
[CEO He, we love you]

343
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,400
Tianliang colleagues! Come write well wishes for the CEO!

344
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,040
Wish him a speedy recovery!

345
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,380
We have many different colored papers.

346
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,450
If you're willing to, you can fold some paper cranes for him as well!

347
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,980
We will collect them and send everything to his hospital room!

348
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,020
Come write well wishes for the CEO!

349
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,620
Wish him a speedy recovery!

350
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,730
If you're finished writing, you can stick them on the wall!

351
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,620
CEO needs you all, and Tianliang Group needs you all!

352
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,810
- I hope you all can—
- Isn't the company's lobby a public space?

353
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,020
What are you all doing here, making noises and causing a ruckus?

354
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,140
W-We're praying for the CEO.

355
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,650
Got it.

356
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,480
This event was started by the employees themselves.

357
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,230
Is that so?

358
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,560
So touching.

359
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,360
Tianxing worked his way up from the bottom of the company.

360
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,570
He spent all these years working his way up from the bottom to his current position.

361
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,430
There must be many people who support him.

362
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,890
If it weren't for Uncle Hu's renegade vote in the last minute,

363
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,270
Tianxing would've been Tianliang's chairman.

364
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,590
Layoffs?

365
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,140
Why are you suddenly calling for layoffs?

366
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,990
Do you know what Tianliang's largest monthly expense is?

367
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,110
Salary.

368
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,380
How did you, the Chief HR Officer, do your job?

369
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,050
I'm not the chairman. Why do I need to know this?

370
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,870
If you know this, you can help the company make money.

371
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,580
In order to increase the company's profits,

372
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,020
we must lay people off.

373
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,090
Okay.

374
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,950
Then how many do you want to lay off?

375
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,150
One-third.

376
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,660
One-third!

377
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,000
- Chairwoman.
- Qiaozhi.

378
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,540
This is the list of employees to be laid off I just came up with.

379
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,440
Take a look.

380
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,920
- This is—
- Uncle Hu.

381
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,970
How are Board Directors Sun, Zhang, and Xu doing recently?

382
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,020
They're all doing well.

383
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,700
Really?

384
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,760
Thank you for caring, Chairwoman.

385
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,630
Surely they're doing too well.

386
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,660
Looks like it's time for me to go visit them.

387
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,400
You're sure?

388
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,370
He Mingli said she's laying off one-third of the employees.

389
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,380
She said it's to increase the company's profits.

390
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,410
This news has already been spread.

391
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,780
Layoffs are just a means.

392
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,160
I think she has some other goal.

393
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,790
What goal?

394
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,990
It's fine. If the enemy doesn't make a move, then I won't make a move.

395
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,550
I'd like to see what they can do to us.

396
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,510
If I hear any other news, I'll let you know immediately.

397
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,320
Thanks.

398
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,360
I'm only taking a peek at this for your sake.

399
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,580
Didn't think I'd look this good all dressed up.

400
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,930
That's right. This is also my first time wearing a gown like this.

401
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,960
So beautiful.

402
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,760
I wish I could bring it back to the real world.

403
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,220
Is this not realistic enough?

404
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,260
We only have these pretty dresses to wear because of work.

405
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,340
After we're done, we still have to return them. Got it?

406
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,590
Let's remember this moment.

407
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,910
CEO is so handsome!

408
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,470
Don't you think the CEO looks especially good in a suit?

409
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,930
It's okay.

410
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,660
I'll never forgive you for leaving me at a bus station yesterday.

411
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,760
Where's Chuchu?

412
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,170
Do you even have to ask?

413
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,440
The female lead always makes the final appearance.

414
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,880
And then when the CEO sees her,

415
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,280
his eyes will start sparkling and everything will turn to slow motion

416
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,520
as he affectionately gazes at the female lead.

417
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,330
Sorry, I'm late!

418
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,850
Why is her dress prettier?

419
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,040
It's time.

420
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,670
What time?

421
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,920
The fall.

422
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,220
Damn! Are you a fortune-teller?

423
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,500
Sorry!

424
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,750
Are you okay?

425
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,080
I'm okay.

426
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,630
I knew it.

427
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,370
What? Does she not have any hands?

428
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,770
Why do you have to help her put it on?

429
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,720
Thank you.

430
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,150
Today, every investor that is here for the banquet

431
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,250
is the company's important guest.

432
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,460
Low-level mistakes — like wires catching on fire — absolutely cannot happen again today.

433
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,080
CEO, we've finished re-examining all the wires of the entire venue.

434
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,370
The safety measures have been checked as well. There are no problems.

435
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,840
The banquet will go smoothly. Please don't worry.

436
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,270
You've all worked hard for today's banquet.

437
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:59,500
We must let investors feel our strength and integrity.

438
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,580
Okay, you can all go to your seats now.

439
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,170
Okay.

440
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,450
Hasn't Sister Susan already checked everything?

441
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,420
Why do we still have to double check?

442
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,860
I'm worried about your safety, okay?

443
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,740
Remember, don't walk on the stairs alone or take the elevator alone.

444
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,750
Be especially careful of anything square, sharp, cold, and hot.

445
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,930
Why do you worry about me more than my mom does?

446
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,870
In short, don't do things by yourself.

447
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,720
Whether you're going to the storage room, restroom, or lounge, always bring someone with you.

448
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,190
Okay, I got it.

449
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,710
Where's the caviar that we're serving to the investors? Why's it not here yet?

450
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,480
Not here? How come?

451
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,160
- I'll go contact the manufacturer.
- Hurry!

452
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,780
Hey! Do you have a goldfish brain?

453
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,150
I told you just three seconds ago not to do anything by yourself!

454
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,010
I'm coming with you.

455
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,700
Please come quickly.

456
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,600
What did the driver say?

457
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,810
That he will be here soon.

458
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,590
Where is he?

459
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,710
Can he find the road?

460
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,010
Hey! Over here! Over here!

461
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,530
Can you do it? Be careful.

462
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,500
Okay.

463
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,170
- Here, you take this up first.
- We should be able to make it in time.

464
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,170
You go first.

465
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,140
One, two, three.

466
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,400
My phone. Did I drop it in the truck?

467
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,800
Leave it. I'll get it for you. You go ahead.

468
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,370
Don't keep rushing me.

469
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,530
I'm already going as fast as possible.

470
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,440
Hey!

471
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,410
Hey!

472
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,980
I knew it! I knew this would happen.

473
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,400
Hey! Help! Open the door!

474
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,030
Open the door!

475
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,010
Help! Open the door!

476
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,070
Hey! Open the door!

477
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,440
♫ Lost to you ♫

478
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:48,810
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

479
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,190
♫ If you were a painter ♫

480
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,510
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

- Here, you take this up first.
- We should be able to make it in time.

484
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,250
You go first.

485
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,120
One, two, three.

486
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,310
My phone. Did I drop it in the truck?

487
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,760
Leave it. I'll get it for you. You go ahead.

488
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,390
Don't keep rushing me.

489
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,490
I'm already going as fast as possible.

490

Hey!

491
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,300
Hey!

492
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,130
I knew it! I knew this would happen.

493
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,280
Hey! Help! Open the door!

494
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,890
Open the door!

This is the guest list for today's meeting.

- Let's check it again.
- Okay.

499
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,300
Jingda Biotechnology.

500
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,410
Okay.

503

Okay.

504
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,810
Yi— wait!

505
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,050
Caviar? Didn't I ask Chuchu to bring it?

506
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,720
Chuchu?

507
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,340
Yes.

508
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:44,990
No wonder it seemed as if someone was screaming for help in the freezer truck that just drove away.

509
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,260
Give me Chuchu's number. Quickly!

510
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,000
Okay, okay, okay.

511
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,930
Did you get in touch with her?

512
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,810
My calls aren't going through to Chuchu's phone. The driver isn't picking up either.

513
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,030
What about the truck company?

514
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,370
I found the truck's delivery route. I'll send it to you.

[Seven minutes to destination]

516
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,480
Situ Aoran is so slow.

517
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,940
Is he riding a bike?

518
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,820
A hero saving the damsel is so inefficient.

519
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,550
By the time he comes, the female lead will already be dead!

[Incoming Call]

521
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,020
Hello?

522
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,390
Someone is trapped in the freezer. Stop the vehicle.

523
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,390
I'm afraid she'll get hypothermia.

524
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,630
Wait.

525
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,360
I'm not the female lead.

526
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,490
Will no one come to save me?

527
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,220
This truck! It won't stop!

528
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,800
Drive to the coastal highway. The fewer people, the better.

529
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,870
The brakes aren't working! I'm afraid I won't be able to safely drive to the suburbs!

530
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,470
It's useless to be afraid. You must drive.

531
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,440
I'll go find you right away.

532
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,450
- Chuchu.
- How come you're here?

533
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,340
Should I not be here?

534
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,890
Didn't you go to get caviar and get trapped in the freezer truck?

535
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,690
Did someone get trapped in the freezer truck?

536
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,410
You have to accept your fate if you're not the female lead.

537
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,380
Rough fish have to save themselves.

538
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,960
The overbearing CEO hasn't fallen in love with me yet.

539
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,370
I can't die here!

540
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,990

Help!

542
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,570
Are the brakes still not working?

543
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,390
It's not working. It won't brake!

544
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,170
What about the handbrake?

545
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,800
It's still no use!

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,000
To jump off the truck.

566
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,690
How can you be ready for something like that?

567
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,430

Are you alright?

574
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,740
How can I be alright?

575
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,780
I thought I was going to die!

576
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,990
You didn't give me a warning before jumping.

577
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,960
Even if I didn't die from the fall, I could've died from shock.

578
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,070
I thought I was going to be buried with a bunch of dead fish eggs.

579
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:57,050
Don't you know? You're the CEO!

580
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,940
You have a cheat code! You have the power of being the male lead!

581
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,140
You can do anything! You're great at everything! But I'm not! I'm nothing!

582
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,990
I could actually die! Do you know that?

583
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,530
If you want to hit me to vent your frustrations, you can.

584
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,620
But can you hit this side instead?

585
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,720
What?

586
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,510
It hurts.

587
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,020
You're not hitting me anymore?

588
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,750
Since you're letting me hit you, I don't want to anymore.

589
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,510
Do you feel a bit better?

590
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,520
There's something I want to ask you.

591
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,440
What is it?

592
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,720
Chuchu...

593
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,440
She's really not in that truck, right?

594
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,050
Chuchu isn't in the truck.

595
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,960
You don't have to worry.

596
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,460
Don't get sick.

597
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,120
Is your wound okay?

598
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,140
Should you go to the hospital?

599
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:45,380
Right now, there is something more important for me to do.

600
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,030
Hey...

601
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,840
Where is CEO Situ?

602
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,720
It's the annual appreciation banquet today. How is he not present?

603
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,470
Distinguished guests, please stay calm.

604
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,910
The CEO went back to the company to handle some business.

605
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,700
He will be here soon.

606
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,560
On the table are delicacies that Royal Group carefully prepared for guests. Please enjoy.

607
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,290
What business is more important than the appreciation banquet?

608
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,900
There are no issues with the company's operations and finance, right?

609
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,190
It's unusual that Situ Aoran hasn't showed up.

610
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,470
Everyone should be cautious with their investment.

611
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,590
CSO, what should we do?

612
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:49,540
If the CEO does not show up soon, I'm afraid the investors will leave.

613
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,460
Exactly when is Situ coming?

614
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,490
If he's not coming, don't waste our time!

615
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't care. I'm not waiting anymore.

616
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:37,370
Everyone, sorry to keep you waiting.

617
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,440
I'd like to welcome everyone to today's appreciation banquet.

618
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,210
Next, I will report on Royal Group's profits from last year

How did you know that Chuchu would be in danger?

630
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,620
Did I?

631
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,920
Stop faking. Chuchu already told me.

632
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,730
Chuchu said you've been acting strange since yesterday.

633
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,010
You wouldn't let her touch knives and forks or be near electrical wires.

634

You wouldn't let her do anything.

635
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,080
You wouldn't even let her do things on her own.

636
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,270
Moreover, you kept warning her that she was in danger.

637
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:17,610
You even predicted that she would trip. Why?

638
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,570
Because...

639
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,560
Because since I was little, I've always had a mysterious sense of what'll happen next.

640
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,670
A sixth sense, déjà vu.

Déjà vu?

00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,490
Déjà vu?

643
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,250
That's right. That.

644
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,180
Bullshit.

645
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,290
Aoran?

646
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:42,390
There's only one way she could know that Chuchu would be in danger.

647
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,670
It's because she's the mastermind behind harming Chuchu.

648
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,320
I'm the mastermind?

649
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,190
Yes. It's you.

650
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,000
Why is it me?

651
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,340
If it were me, then why was the person who was locked in the freezer truck me and not Chuchu?

652
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,140
Because you're stupid.

653
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,680
Dou E wasn't as wronged as I am.
(Character in the Chinese play "The Injustice to Dou E")

654
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,430
I was locked in the freezer truck and forced to jump off the truck with you.

655
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,450
Now, I'm even being blamed as the mastermind.

656
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,940
Don't think that you can be this domineering just because you're an overbearing CEO.

657
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,060
What Xiao'en said makes sense.

658
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,710
I don't know what mistakes took place,

659
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,600
but there is definitely a problem with Zheng Xiao'en.

660
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,070
Forget it. You won't believe anything I say anyway.

661
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,600
Okay, do you understand the presumption of innocence until proven guilty?

662
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,090
If you think that I was the one to set up Chuchu,

663
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,630
then bring out the evidence that I was the assailant!

664
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,500
Why is it flipped so that I have to prove my innocence?

665
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,410
I have no evidence, but I have the basis.

666
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,040
What basis?

667
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
She has bullied Chuchu before.

668
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,010
Zheng Xiao'en, it's because you've been previously convicted that I can't trust you.

669
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,710
I already told you that it was a misunderstanding.

670
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,100
Can't you give someone who's been reborn another chance?

671
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,990
Another chance is something that others give you,

672
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,760
not something that you can demand.

673
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,030
You're just prejudiced against me.

674
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,350
You want to prove your innocence, right?

675
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,790
Okay!

676
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,060
Starting now, you'll be the assistant to the Chief Strategy Officer.

677
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,570
I'll have Qingfeng be in charge of watching you.

678
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,010
Let's see what kinds of tricks you can play.

679
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,560
♫ Lost to you ♫

680
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:29,170
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

681
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,330
♫ If you were a painter ♫

682
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,640
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

683
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:40,700
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

684
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:47,330
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

685
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,470
I can't believe he said that I was playing tricks.

686
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,640
I'm telling you, I have a lot of tricks up my sleeve.

687
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,620
Just you wait!

688
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:01,820
Xiao'en, in the future, when you have time, we still have to eat lunch together.

689
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:05,290
We'll see you in the break room. The gossip won't end.

690
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,940
You have to take care of yourselves!

691
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,340
Xiao'en, I'm sorry.

692
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,860
It's all because I dragged you down.

693
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,010
It's okay. There's no need to apologize.

694
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:35,180
My beloved coworkers, I'm transferring to the strategy department now.

695
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,080
Wait a second.

696
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,950
Come with me.

697
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,950
What is this?

698
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:49,520
An affidavit. Sign it quickly.

699
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,870
All of the clauses for confidentiality are on it.

700
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,920
You absolutely can't sell us out.

701
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,610
[Signed: Xiao'en]

702
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,320
It's really heavy, right?

703
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,980
Come with me.

704
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,650
The standard nice guy is so considerate.

705
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,370
Too bad you're the third wheel fated to not be loved.

706
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,290
From now on, this is your seat.

707
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:42,940
It's usually just me and Situ on this floor, but he's very busy.

708
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,480
Now that you're here, there's finally someone to keep me company.

709
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,590
Sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?

710
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,060
There's finally someone to keep me company.

711
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,050
The one before that.

712
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,970
It's usually just me and Situ on this floor.

713
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:59,220
That's it! Where is his desk?

714
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,110
[Situ Aoran]

715
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,430
Wow!

716
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:12,390
Isn't this the legendary first row?

717
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,360
Before, I could only use the drone to sneakily look.

718
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,740
Now, it's real person VR.

719
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:22,020
I basically went from the roof of Taipei Arena to the first row.

720
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,530
What are you guys doing?

721
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:33,930
The chairwoman is conducting an audit.

722
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,520
We ask for your cooperation, Director Sun.

723
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:40,070
I personally...

724
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,300
Who are you? Why did you just barge in?

725
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,700
Believe it or not, I will report you to the police!

726
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,630
Director Zhang, as you secretly meet with contractors,

727
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:52,020
perhaps you should think about how to explain yourself to the chairwoman instead of calling the police.

728
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,710
Director Xu, please hold on. The chairwoman is still in a meeting.

729
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:59,050
What meeting? Don't you know who I am? Beat it!

730
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,010
Yes, I understand.

731
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,730
That's great, He Mingli.

732
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:08,040
Don't assume I don't know what you and Mr. Hu are scheming.

733
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,280
Director Xu, what are you saying?

734
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,500
The chairwoman and I are just discussing...

735
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,870
whether we should have Chinese food or Western food for lunch today.

736
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,670
He Mingli, think about it.

737
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:25,210
If it were not for the few of us back then, would Tianliang have reached such a scale?

738
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:28,720
What you're doing is the definition of ungrateful.

739
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,360
If falsifying accounts and taking kickbacks express gratitude and loyalty,

740
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,550
shouldn't I cut the weeds and dig up the roots for the good of Tianliang Group?

741
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,890
Director Xu, if you have been honorable,

742
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,590
what do you have to be afraid of?

743
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,240
Don't think I'm actually afraid of you.

744
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,400
Let's wait and see!

745
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,460
Chairwoman, I understand your dilemma,

746
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:06,430
but for some matters, it's best not to be too extreme.

747
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:12,300
After all, these directors aren't to be reckoned with and aren't just there for display.

748
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:17,780
What's wrong? You also object to how I do things?

749
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,330
Chairwoman, no, don't misunderstand.

750
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:24,370
I support you 100%.

751
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,400
Chairwoman, we found it.

752
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,720
The hospital said that CEO's personal belongings were taken away by Su Shanna.

753
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,980
What about the will?

754
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,540
It must also be with Su Shanna.

755
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,510
We were even able to knock down her master.

756
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,950
Are you afraid we can't take care of her?

757

[Susan]
[Marketing Director]

758
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,300
Okay, I got it. I'll give it to you tomorrow.

759
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,040
Bye bye.

760
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,620
Hey, what do you want to eat for lunch?

761
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,110
What?

762
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,520
Should we ask her if she wants to eat with us?

763
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,050
Why ask her—

764
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:32,280
Chuchu, do you want to eat lunch together?

765
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,400
No, you guys go ahead.

766
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,770
You see? You see?

767
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,880
We're giving her a chance, and she doesn't even know to take it.

768
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,480
Is she stupid?

769
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,450
Then should we ask Xiao'en?

770
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:08,220
Are you stupid? We’re in the thick of things right now!

771
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,430
If we ask her now, wouldn't it expose that we're on her side?

772
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,860
Even though she has faded to black in our boss's heart,

773
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,440
she'll always shine as bright as snow in our hearts.

01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:42,030
Quietly in his handsomeness, he slowly stopped breathing.

01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:12,750
He reaches out with his crafty finger.

800
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:18,050
Wait, "crafty finger" shouldn't be used here.

801
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:22,680
He reaches out with a slender finger and grabbed a book.

802
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,230
Wipe your drool.

803
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:37,000
I think you forgot that I'm your boss.

804
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,330
Yes, Boss.

805
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:45,030
May I ask if there's anything I can do for you?

806
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,900
Did you finish organizing the info I gave you this morning?

807
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,530
Almost. Almost.

808
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:56,530
Okay. When you're done with it, take it to accounting.

809
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:59,760
Hey— where's accounting?

810
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,390
Of course, I know where accounting is!

811
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,840
I'm just testing you.

812
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,240
Get back to work quickly.

813
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,490
Isn't he supposed to be the nice guy?

814
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,160
He won't even tell me where accounting is.

815
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,320
So petty.

816
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,160
[Royal Group Summary]

[Royal Group]

818
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,120
Are you okay?

819
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,300
I'm fine.

820
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,600
That's all she eats?

821
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,280
This bitter story set-up is too evil.

822
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,370
- Order anything.
- It's really okay.

823
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,720
Aiyo, your lunch was spilled because of me.

824
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,810
In order to show my apologies, your lunch is on me.

825
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,850
There's really no need. I'm not even that hungry right now.

826
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,750
I don't usually eat lunch anyway.

827
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,600
Also, this place looks a little expensive.

828
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,260
Let's go. Or you can order first and I'll—

829
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,110
Order!

830
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,740
Signature sandwich.

831
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,000
Why are you ordering a sandwich?

832
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,650
Are you looking down on my purse?

833
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,910
Order a meal!

834
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,270
- There's really no need. Really.
- Do you eat fish?

835
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,190
Yes.

836
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:57,000
Sir, two A meals.

837
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:06,990
Sister Susan doesn't have any patience with me because I don't do a good enough job.

838
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,680
I only got the job offer because they made an exception.

839
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,470
I know that there are many places where my abilities are lacking,

840
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:15,910
so I found some online classes.

841
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,140
She can't be the type that studies until midnight and doesn't sleep, right?

842
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,250
I can only study until 10 PM.

843
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,970
At night, I need to go to the hospital.

844
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:32,150
Is it because your mom or dad is sick?

845
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,620
How did you know?

846
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:42,620
I'm so happy!

847
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,050
Happiness came to me too suddenly.

848
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,070
- Zheng Xiao'en.
- Yes, Boss?

849
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:49,300
Stop messing around.

850
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,040
Otherwise I don't know what I'll do to you.

851
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,780
If you want to fight with the overbearing CEO over his woman, history shows that it won't end well.

852
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,410
It won't be good for you if he finds out you like Chuchu as well.

853
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:01,540
Don't be scared. I'm here.

854
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:05,140
I never thought that I, Zheng Xiao'en, would be a matchmaker someday.

855
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,740
What else do you have to say for yourself?

856
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,290
You are fired!
