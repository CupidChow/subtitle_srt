If you’re such an irresponsible person,

But in all fairness,

164
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,570
do you think the cost of our time is the same?

165
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,420
I gave you my time, which means that I trust you.

166
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,900
But in the end, you treated me as a human ball.

167
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,480
You come when you want to.

168
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,220
When you don’t, you kick me to your teammate.

169
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,970
I know I'm in the wrong—

170
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,000
If you’re not apologizing from the bottom of your heart,

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,630
then don’t say sorry to me.

172
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,570
Although You’re an Overbearing CEO, It’s Okay?

173
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,280
What? Do you have any comments?

174
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,940
I really don’t understand

175
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,850
why Tianxing would let a romance novel publishing company publish his autobiography.

176
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,130
It's so ridiculous.

177
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,730
Do you want to know the reason?

178
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,200
You know why?

179
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,990
No, I don't.

180
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,070
I just know that wealthy people think differently from us.

181
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,620
That’s why he is the CEO,

182
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,870
and you can only be an assistant.

183
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,620
Are you teaching me a lesson?

184
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,620
Who gave you the courage?

185
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,280
Brainless romance novel editor.

186
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,530
What do you mean, brainless?

187
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,850
I don’t care if you insult me, but I won't let you hear the end of it if you insult romance novels!

188
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,510
It's because you don’t read romance novels that you can’t get the overbearing CEO!

189
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,710
Which of your eyes saw that I was trying to get the overbearing CEO?

190
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,260
I saw it with both eyes!

191
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,690
Zheng Xiao’en and I used a drone and saw it clearly

192
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,850
in high definition, unpixelated, and with no blindspots!

193
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:13,430
So it seems... you still can't think of a reason to convince me.

194
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,410
Then let’s follow the original plan.

195
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,730
You will continue to conduct my interviews.

196
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,130
Of course. That's exactly what she'll do.

197
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,130
That’s what we should’ve done in the first place.

198
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,170
No problem.

199
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,790
See you tomorrow.

200
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,960
CEO, I’ll walk you out.

201
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,200
After you.

202
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,390
These romance novels are a gift from me.

203
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,300
After you learn from them, you can use those skills on overbearing CEOs other than He Tianxing.

204
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,100
As for how successful the mission will be, the face decides that.

205
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,900
I can't help you with that part.

206
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,350
Mr. He, I’m sorry that you had to specially make the trip here.

207
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,690
I’m really sorry.

208
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,330
You guys are done talking?

209
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,640
Where's Xiao'en?

210
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,420
As for the interview time and location, Su Shanna will notify you later.

211
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,800
Okay. CEO, take care.

212
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,660
If you’re free, come over for a visit. Our office is so close anyway.

213
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,650
If you’re free, come over for a cup of tea.

214
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,640
- CEO, watch your step.
- Be careful.

215
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,810
Be careful on the road!

216
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,780
Bye bye!

217
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,150
Bye bye!

218
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,650
Where's Xiao'en?

219
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,890
Do you think He Tianxing’s plan is trustworthy?

220
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,630
We have no other choice; we can only trust him.

221
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,730
Miss, the most important thing now is to save Tianliang Group.

222
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,230
The only person who has this ability is Young Master Tianxing.

223
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,960
My most hated rival turned out to be my last teammate.

224
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,120
In the end, the person standing by my side

225
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,480
is actually He Tianxing.

226
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,800
Madam.

227
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,370
Mingli.

228
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,500
Mom, why are you here?

229
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,250
Haven’t you watched TV? Tianjian is wanted by the police.

230
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,710
How can this happen?

231
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,940
Hurry up and think of a solution.

232
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,440
Think of a solution?

233
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,490
When did I become in charge of the court of law?

234
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,900
We can’t just sit back and let Tianjian be wrongly accused.

235
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,820
What if he wasn’t wrongly accused?

236
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,030
That's not possible.

237
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,970
Since young, he’s been kind and timid.

238
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,700
He can’t possibly kill someone.

239
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,200
It’s He Tianxing. To seize back control of the company,

240
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,140
he's falsely accusing Tianjian on purpose.

241
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,040
Now that I think about it, it’s really not easy being He Tianxing.

242
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,530
No matter what mistakes arise, we just push it all on him.

243
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,690
Are you speaking up for He Tianxing?

244
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,830
I’m not speaking up for anyone.

245
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,230
I’m telling the truth.

246
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,400
He Tianxing was pushed off the building by He Tianjian.

247
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,290
That's not possible.

248
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,730
You're lying!

249
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,250
I saw it with my own eyes.

250
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,670
Even though I was the mastermind,

251
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,190
Tianjian was the one who carried out the task.

252
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,730
Mingli, how could you?

253
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,960
So now do you understand?

254
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,540
Tianjian is not innocent at all.

255
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,630
It’s all because of you. It’s all because of you!

256
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,480
What kind of elder sister are you?

257
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,960
Since young, Tianjian has always listened to you.

258
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,580
He would do whatever you told him to.

259
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,100
How could you tell him to do such a thing?

260
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,700
I only have one son!

261
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,470
Why don’t you blame him for being weak and gullible?

262
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,000
Growing up, whenever he faced problems, he only knew how to hide behind me.

263
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,730
No matter what the situation was, other people had to make decisions for him.

264
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,580
He’s not a child anymore!

265
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,730
It’s about time he learns to face problems himself!

266
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,520
You’re talking nonsense.

267
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,500
You’re talking nonsense.

268
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
You guys are the ones who led him astray.

269
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,980
That’s right. It’s you guys!

270
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,380
You guys led him astray!

271
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,380
It’s you guys!

272
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,880
You guys led my son astray.

273
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,730
Tianjian.

274
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,840
- Xiao'en.
- Yeah?

275
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,590
We haven’t lazed around like this at home for a really long time.

276
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,700
It feels like a lot of things have happened after you woke up.

277
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,740
But it’s good that everything is gradually getting back on track.

278
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,180
Thank you for never leaving my side.

279
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,740
You’re indeed my best friend.

280
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,290
Finally there’s someone who can share the world’s most delicious unit with me.

281
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,010
Half a bag!

282
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,900
God, I really miss this flavor.

283
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,690
You’ll have to see He Tianxing again tomorrow.

284
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,650
Will you be okay?

285
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,360
I'll be okay!

286
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,310
Business is business. What's so hard about that?

287
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,730
Alright!

288
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,640
It's very hard.

289
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,630
Is it because they look alike

290
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,590
that I keep seeing Aoran in him?

291
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,650
Zheng Xiao'en is planning on having an affair

292
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,380
and making a cuckold of Situ Aoran.

293
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,180
I'm not!

294
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,450
Do you know what's crazier than cheating on an overbearing CEO?

295
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,160
What?

296
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,060
Cheating on him twice.

297
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,430
Huh?

298
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,960
Look, you went into the novel thinking

299
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
"Situ Aoran is so much like He Tianxing!"

300
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,400
Then you come back to the real world thinking,

301
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,210
"He Tianxing is so much like Situ Aoran!"

302
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,780
You are toying with the overbearing CEO from both worlds in the palm of your hands.

303
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,360
You are a paragon of womankind and a wholesale distributor of green hats (symbolizes men who are cuckolds).

304
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,090
Is that a compliment?

305
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,130
Of course.

306
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,050
Green hats are only green if the man considers it to be.

307
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,730
Think about it. Yesterday, I liked Gong Yoo.

308
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,420
Today, I like Lee Min-ho. Tomorrow, I'll like Hyun Bin.

309
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,070
Do they think they're wearing a green hat (being cheated on)?

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,080
That's right!

311
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,020
But...

312
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,740
My relationship with Situ Aoran is different.

313
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,570
I know.

314
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,430
Your marriage with him is not recognized in this world.

315
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,100
So is your relationship with He Tianxing crossing a moral line?

316
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,560
- No.
- That's right! Stop fretting.

317
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,850
It's more urgent to quickly finish our mission.

318
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,090
Press on! Pull yourself together!

319
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,490
Hey, thanks to you,

320
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,820
I finally experienced for the first time today what it's like to be roared at by an overbearing CEO.

321
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,060
Even though he shouted another woman's name,

322
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,490
the anger was directed toward me.

323
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,190
In that second, I had a place in his heart, right?

324
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,590
Another woman? Who?

325
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,610
Who else could it be, other than you?

326
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,100
Where is Zheng Xiao'en?

327
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,660
I said, where is Zheng Xiao'en right now?

328
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,650
I need to make out with her right now.

329
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,950
What?!

330
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,980
I added that sentence at the end.

331
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,340
You scared me to death.

332
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,120
You were secretly happy about it. I can see you trying not to smile.

333
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,200
- Don't think you can lie to me.
- When did I?

334
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,630
You were.

335
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,980
You don't even know. This afternoon, I really wanted to ask He Tianxing to stay still

336
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,390
so that I could take a photo certifying that the overbearing CEO was here.

337
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,240
After all, the only roaring god I know in my life is the chief editor.

338
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,190
Speaking of the chief editor, I almost forgot

339
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,720
that I need to take time off next Friday.

340
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,710
It's almost the orphanage director's birthday, isn't it?

341
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,750
Don't worry, I'll let the chief editor know.

342
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,970
[CEO, You're So Naughty]

343
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,990
[Chairman He Tianjian]

344
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,720
Uncle Hu.

345
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,910
Miss, why are you here?

346
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,590
I can't come to my family's company?

347
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,600
That's not what I meant.

348
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,520
I was just concerned for you.

349
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,450
I'm just joking with you, Uncle Hu.

350
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,710
Don't worry.

351
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,220
Ah, okay. Is your health okay?

352
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,800
Thank you for your concern, Uncle Hu. I'm better.

353
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,740
Actually, I wanted to rest more,

354
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,300
but Tianjian is having issues, so how could I not return?

355
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,280
If I didn't step in, who else could carry Tianliang on their shoulders? Could you?

356
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,320
Miss, you really love telling jokes.

357
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,640
I'm not. I'm for real this time.

358
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,900
Before, I worked myself till I was sick.

359
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,050
After a long break, I realize that people need to take breaks.

360
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,630
Unfortunately, God isn't sparing me.

361
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,190
Miss, we are all very clear how responsible you are.

362
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,540
We are just concerned about your health. You need to...

363
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,630
Miss, Young Master Tianxing has returned.

364
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,680
[Tianliang Group]

365
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,320
CEO, welcome back. I hope you had a full recovery.

366
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,400
Aren't you coming along?

367
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,650
CEO, we knew that you could overcome this crisis.

368
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,600
Thank you, everyone.

369
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,790
CEO, welcome back.

370
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,230
We've waited a long time for you.

371
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,600
Your life sure is resilient.

372
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,550
A fall from the rooftop couldn't even kill you.

373
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,130
Turns out there really are miracles in this world.

374
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,950
If you could even become Tianliang's chairwoman,

375
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,000
this world definitely has miracles.

376
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,950
He Tianxing!

377
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,580
Don't be like this.

378
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,210
The late chairman said we're all family.

379
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,140
There's no need to have daggers drawn at the first encounter,

380
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,320
especially with all the employees watching.

381
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Tianxing, didn't you just get discharged from the hospital?

382
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,500
You haven't recovered for very long. Is there a rush to be back at the company?

383
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,230
I have a reason I must return.

384
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,790
What reason?

385
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:06,030
I returned to Tianliang today in order to exercise the right to inspection as a board director

386
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,910
and reexamine all investment profits and losses of Tianliang and its subsidiary companies.

387
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,960
Uncle Hu, I'll need your assistance.

388
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,020
That won't be a problem, right?

389
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,580
Of course that won't be a problem.

390
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,890
Let's go.

391
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,790
Wait.

392
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,690
Why do you seem familiar?

393
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,480
Have we met somewhere before?

394
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,980
I don't think so. I think you're mistaken.

395
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,470
What is going on?

396
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,810
The day Tianxing transferred hospitals, you were the person he grabbed on the stretcher.

397
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,570
So you already knew each other?

398
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,530
What do you mean?

399
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,540
I grabbed her?

400
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,830
When they were putting you in the ambulance,

401
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,590
you were unconscious but you suddenly grabbed someone's hand.

402
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,560
That was her.

403

♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

404

♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

405
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,140

You use this too?

408
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,630
Too?

409
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,010
So who else uses this?

410
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,680
It's a bit hard to explain.

411
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,330
There are so many things in your life that are hard to explain.

412
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,800
Are there?

413
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,650
That incident at the hospital.

414
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,630
Why would I grab your hand when I'm unconscious?

415
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,240
That's something I should be asking you.

416
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,310
I was just passing by when you grabbed me.

417
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,410
You nearly scared me to death.

418
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,570
I thought I was being taken as a replacement.
(Chinese folklore)

419
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,740
I'm the victim.

420
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,900
But I clearly didn't know you at that time.

421
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,700
What happened after?

422
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,010
Afterwards, I had a fever when I went home that night.

423
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,120
And then...?

424
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,110
You fell into a coma for three months, just like I did.

425
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,140
Don't you think this is really weird?

426
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,770
You and I had no prior interaction,

427
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,740
yet at a time of life and death, I grabbed your hand.

428
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,490
Then, we were both in a coma for three months.

429
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,940
It is really weird.

430
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,220
Could this all just be a coincidence?

431
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,110
No, I don't think it's just a coincidence.

432
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,930
Then what is it?

433
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,480
It's fate.

434
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,810
You've read too many novels.

435
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,430
No, it really is fate.

436
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,030
Otherwise, why didn't you grab anybody else and just so happen to grab me?

437
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,400
Alright, let's just call it fate.

438
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,380
Have a seat.

439
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,520
Are you done with your work?

440
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,120
Not yet, but I don't want to make you wait too long.

441
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,280
Same rules. You ask a question, then I'll ask a question.

442
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,400
I came prepared today.

443
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,670

No, go ahead.

In order to celebrate your return,

449
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,540
we would like to host a dinner tonight to welcome you back to the team.

450
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,990
I don't know if you are available to attend, CEO.

451
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,550
Of course.

452
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,720
Please let Shanna know the time and place. I will show up on time.

453
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,000
That's great. The employees are really looking forward to this.

454
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,720
This is Ruge's editor, Zheng Xiao'en.

455
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,450
Hello, Miss Zheng.

456
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,860
Do you want to join us for dinner tonight?

457
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,880
No, it's okay.

458
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,470
I'm not a Tianliang employee.

459
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,770
Not just the financials for the past few years,

460
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,370
we have to start inspecting from the first investment case that Hu Chaoqin managed.

461
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,170
Even if they're companies that are already bankrupt,

462
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,510
we still need to find the people who were responsible at the time and the companies' account books.

463
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,340
Check for any discrepancies between the accounts on both sides.

464
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,410
Don't worry. I will take care of it.

465
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,780
Even if the accounts on both sides are checked, there won’t be a problem and you won’t be implicated.

466
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,880
Yes, I'd like to verify with you the discount and loan, as well as that sum of money.

467
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,370
We must force him into a dead end,

468
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,190
so that he can only take the one emergency exit we've left him.

469
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,340
He must flee in defeat.

470
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,340
Didn't I already kick you both out?

471
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,710
Why are you both back?

472
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,380
Hello? It's me.

473
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,400
Are you free right now?

474
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,770
[Chairman He Tianjian]

475
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,420
He Tianxing hit the nail on the head.

476
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,550
It was Hu Chaoqin who called.

477
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,960
He said that there’s something he’d like to discuss with me.

478
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,850
Miss, this is just the beginning.

479
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,070
You must be careful.

480
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,740
You must not let the cat out of the bag.

481
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,450
I know.

482
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,690
What do you mean there's no need? Who said there's no need?

483
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,930
Are you just going to give He Tianxing to the white lotus?

484
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,330
That's not it.

485
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,560
It's a company dinner. I don't even work for Tianliang Group.

486
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,710
Where are they having dinner?

487
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,170
What do you want to do?

488
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,440
Do you still need to ask? Of course it's pulling out all the old tropes.

489
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,840
Meeting coincidentally, tripping, and kissing until we're satisfied.

490
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,190
We can't.

491
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,370
What do you mean you can't? They already asked you, so it's not like you can't.

492
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,850
I rejected it.

493
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,920
We can take it back. You can even take back wedding vows.

494
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,730
If you flake on plans, you can still make it up, right?

495
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,370
Hurry up. Hand over the location of the dinner.

496
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,510
I don't know where it is.

497
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,720
Then who should I ask? Su Shanna with the facial paralysis or dumb Jason?

498
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,840
Give me their phone numbers.

499
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,040
How would I have their phone numbers?

500
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,990
I'm so hungry. I want to eat right away.

501
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,870
What a coincidence.

502
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,920
Our table is over here.

503
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,250
- What are you doing?
- It's the white lotus.

504
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,800
She’ll misunderstand and think that we followed them here.

505
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,470
I—

506
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,060
Did we do anything shameful? I have nothing to hide.

507
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,260
Why do I have to cover my face?

508
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,920
Okay, okay. Not so hard.

509
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,990
Shut up and follow me.

510
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,630
Six o'clock direction. Retreat.

511
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,480
Why are you so slow?

512
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,670
It's a waste to order food and not eat it.

513
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,140
Hurry up.

514
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,830
- You again?
- You again?

515
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,470
Did you guys hate each other in a past life?

516
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,250
We meet again.

517
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,840
So hungry.

518
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,800
Let's order this. It'll be tasty.

519
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,510
- I want to drink alcohol.
- You want to drink alcohol?

520
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,170
I want this chocolate flavor one.

521
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,510
Look, there are so many options.

522
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,700
Why did you agree to He Tianxing's invitation?

523
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,380
Oh, please. Who can say no to the overbearing CEO?

524
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,770
At the very least, I can't.

525
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,390
Then you could've just come yourself.

526
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,360
Why did you drag me into this?

527
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,790
You said it yourself. Half a bag is the most delicious unit.

528
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,940
It’s meaningless if I enjoy something by myself.

529
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,640
Order whatever you want to eat. Don't hold back.

530
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,290
Don't worry, I never hold back.

531
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,730
It looks really yummy.

532
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,440
When can we start eating?

533
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,870
I'm so hungry.

534
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,590
Before we eat, let's give a toast to the CEO.

535
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,330
Welcome back, CEO!

536
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,450
Welcome back, CEO!

537
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,260
I haven't been to a gathering with you all in a long time. Thank you.

538
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,310
During my absence, all of you have continuously cheered me on.

539
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,400
I appreciate your kindness.

540
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,810
It’s really great that Tianliang has you guys.

541
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,360
We’re the ones who should thank you.

542
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,860
It’s our fortune to have CEO safely return to the company in good health.

543
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,940
Everyone, let’s give a round of applause to welcome the CEO back to the team!

544
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,950
Sit down please.

545
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,520
Let's eat.

546
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,050
Yes.

547
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,130
CEO.

548
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,020
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

549
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,190
- Eat more.
- Why are you being so nice to me?

550
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,830
Because after I eat, I want to play basketball.

551
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,000
- So suddenly?
- Yes, you can be the ball.

552
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,940
Thank you.

553
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,800
Me too, while you're at it.

554
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,970
Am I a waitress?

555
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,740
Are you okay?

556
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,740
I feel like I’m in the audience.

557
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,170
It’s like watching live streamers compete through a screen.

558
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,870
I don't even have the qualifications to donate to them, let alone join the competition.

559
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:31,480
I’m a complete outsider.

560
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,860
Zheng Xiao’en, I see that you haven’t eaten much.

561
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,320
Is the food not to your taste?

562
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,170
No, I'm not a picky eater at all. I eat everything.

563
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,980
It's happy hour!

564
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,800
Everyone, today’s happy hour happens to be a weekly drinking competition.

565
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,730
Today, the winner of the competition can get 20% off the total bill.

566
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,480
Wow!

567
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,750
CEO, if I win,

568
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,700
can I make a wish to have a pair of cufflinks you wear often?

569
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,160
Does it have to be a drinking competition?

570
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,650
Can't it be a boxing competition?

571
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,470
Please take away my fork and knife.

572
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,830
I'm afraid I won't be able to control myself.

573
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,610
Zheng Xiao’en, fight with her.

574
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,490
Zheng Xiao'en and I want to join the competition.

575
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,680
Ready, set, go!

576
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,020
Go, go, go!

577
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,480
Go, go, go!

578
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,400
You’re almost done.

579
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,290
Go, go, go!

580
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,560
I’m so full.

581
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,400
- My stomach is going to explode!
- Oh, please.

582
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,640
If we don’t catch up quickly, when Chuchu gets the CEO’s cufflinks,

583
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,020
we’ll be too heartbroken to shed tears.

584
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,680
If we don’t determine the winner soon,

585
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,450
the whole department will have to ask for leave tomorrow.

586
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,100
Okay. Then let’s fight a quick battle to determine the winner.

587
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,130
One sentence. Go big or go home.

588
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,070
Beer is for kindergarteners. Let’s compete using mixed drinks!

589
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,590
Who’s competing?

590
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,700
Me!

591
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,610
Me... and my friend!

592
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,310
The person who gets the cufflinks rules the world.

593
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,110
- There’s such a sentence?
- That’s not important.

594
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,350
The important thing is the cufflinks can’t fall into the hands of the white lotus.

595
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,210
Are you ready?

596
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,500
Ready.

597
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,010
Yeah... right.

598
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,440
Ready...

599
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,710
- Set...
- Wait.

600
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,170
CEOs are just so assertive.

601
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,930
CEO, you can’t be biased.

602
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,850
“Handsome” is just one word, but it follows him for life.

603
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,490
Chuntian!

604
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

605
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,070
You won.

606
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,520
Time to go home.

607
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,790
Jason.

608
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,890
I’ll have to trouble you to take care of Shanna and Chuchu.

609
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,690
CEO, are you okay?

610
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,840
I'm fine.

611
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,130
Then I’ll take them home first.

612
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,920
We'll head out now.

613
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,160
I’m sorry.

614
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,440
There’s still something I’d like to tell Xiao’en.

615
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,600
Then you guys take your time to talk.

616
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,180
I suddenly feel a little nauseous again.

617
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,380
I’ll go first. Bye bye.

618
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,570
♫ See you around, will you miss me? ♫

619
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,840
♫ Don't miss home too much when it's time to party ♫

620
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,610
Are you okay?

621
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,420
♫ And I'm leaving home ♫

622
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:10,340
♫ Don't think it's where I belong ♫

623
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,470
♫ I say goodbye in place of gratitude ♫

624
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,480
Although you probably can’t tell,

625
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,750
I'm actually... on the brink of collapsing.

626
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,430
♫ Walking on this unfamiliar street ♫

627
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:28,500
♫ I really want to make a phone call ♫

628
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,380
♫ A number with no one to answer ♫

629
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,700
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

630
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:41,910
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

631
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:48,180
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

632
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,070
Sorry.

633
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,940
I didn't hurt you, did I?

634
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,950
My hand doesn't hurt.

635
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,190
Then it’s...

636
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,400
My heart hurts.

637
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,460
You’re in such a drunken state, yet you’re still so guarded.

638
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,640
How exactly did you grow up?

639
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,700
Thank you.

640
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,930
Are you okay?

641
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,100
I'm fine.

642
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,620
You’re vomiting like this and you still say you’re fine.

643
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,200
Wipe your face.

644
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,750
Thank you.

645
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,790
I'm much better now.

646
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:50,180
It's late. I'll call a taxi for you.

647
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,090
Call a taxi? Why?

648
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,420
To take you home.

649
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,530
You don't think I know how to do such a simple task?

650
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,390
I'm not a three-year-old baby. I can go home by myself.

651
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,540
Also, this isn't what's important.

652
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,580
Then, what's important?

653
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,650
You should hurry and go take a shower, lie in bed, and get some sleep.

654
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,880
These are all the important things.

655
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,100
- But—
- No buts.

656
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,240
Do you know how many people suddenly die when they're drunk?

657
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,380
I won't feel at ease unless I'm by your side watching you.

658
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,280
Here, go take a shower.

659
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,400
Remember not to make the water too hot.

660
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,360
That prevents the blood vessels from constricting rapidly.

661
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,420
Go quickly.

662
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,060
What am I doing here?

663
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,950
I shouldn't be here.

664
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:51,020
Zheng Xiao'en, you didn't want to get close,

665
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,450
yet you can't help but worry.

666
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,660
You already left,

667
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,090
yet you keep thinking about him.

668
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,400
She left?

669
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,730
Where did you go?

670
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:38,720
There's only a convenience store and a cemetery nearby your house.

671
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,120
Where else could I go?

672
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,700
So you helped me forage for food?

673
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,790
I was hungry, and I just picked up some food for you along the way.

674
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,990
Do you want some?

675
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,640
This is ramen.

676
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,200
You must've seen it but never eaten it before.

677
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,160
Let me tell you, it's super unhealthy but super delicious.

678
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,330
I don't know why you think I've never had ramen before.

679
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,990
Not only have I eaten it often,

680
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:22,100
but there was also a time when ramen was the only thing I had to eat.

681
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,770
But it has been a long time since I've eaten it.

682
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,010
I do kind of miss it.

683
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,690
Oh...

684
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,090
You're really different from the overbearing CEO I imagined.

685
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,940
I thought that rich heirs wouldn't eat junk food like this.

686
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,440
You know that He Mingli, He Tianjian, and I

687
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,110
are siblings with the same father but different mothers, right?

688
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,020
Yes.

689
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,870
In the past, my mom was really busy.

690
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:15,540
My dad was even busier.

691
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,870
I was a latchkey kid ever since I was little.

692
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,330
When I was hungry, I'd go buy ramen to eat.

693
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:26,080
When my clothes were dirty, I'd wash them myself.

694
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:31,760
I knew since I was young that only I could take care of myself.

695
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:37,420
I wish there was ramen with such a big pieces of meat in the past.

696
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,740
I thought that every rich heir was born with a silver spoon in their mouth.

697
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,820
But you're still pretty lucky to have had parents.

698
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,480
I don't even know what my parents look like.

699
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,200
So you're like me.

700
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,480
You learned how to make a living and support yourself early on.

701
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,530
Yeah, I used to have a lot of part-time jobs.

702
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:09,390
The most grueling one was having to put on a clam shell costume over the summer.

703
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,860
Is there a more inhuman part-time job than this?

704
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,400
I think I got heat stroke every summer.

705
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,930
Me too.

706
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,830
What?

707
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,840
I've also had a part-time job where I had to dress up in a costume.

708
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,150
Are you trying to console me?

709
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,230
No, it's true.

710
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,600
Once, I did poorly on a test.

711
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,790
I didn't get the scholarship, and I was too scared to tell my mom.

712
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:37,090
So I had to work part-time every weekend.

713
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,660
I never would've thought that you used to work when you were a child.

714
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,230
So we came from the same line of work?

715
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,020
You would've never expected that, right?

716
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,360
Thank goodness my friends at that time were really nice.

717
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,790
They saw how hard I worked, so they would take my shifts for me.

718
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:56,830
Or else, I wouldn't have been able to balance both school and work.

719
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,980
I would've had to work the next semester as well.

720
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,680
I get it.

721
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,980
Even though I didn't have a family, I had friends who were closer than family.

722
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,120
Just like Chuntian.

723
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,670
But ever since my mom passed away, I was taken to the He family

724
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,260
and was transferred to an elite school.

725
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,790
I haven't had ramen since then,

726
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:30,030
and I also lost touch with all my classmates from back then.

727
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,460
Why are you looking at me like that?

728
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,590
I don't know why but

729
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,370
I used to think that we were people from different worlds,

730
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,580
but the more I come to understand you,

731
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:04,990
the more I feel that you're not that far out of reach after all.

I used to think that we were people from different worlds,

the more I feel that you're not that far out of reach after all.

740
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:51,620
Take your time to eat. I'm full.

741
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,770
Hey, leave it here. I'll clean it up.

742
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:57,500
It's okay.

743
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,990
Wait.

744
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,120
You have a fever?

745
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,070
Yes.

746
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,020
When did it start?

747
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,940
Yesterday.

748
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,420
The day before yesterday.

749
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:24,020

I'll help you switch it out with a cold one.

Didn't I say that as long as I reach out my hand,

774
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,870
I must be able to touch you?

775
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:33,950

01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:06,080
I've just read too many romance novels.

805
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,750
Zheng Xiao'en left?

806
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,430
Why didn't she say anything again?

807
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:21,340
Good morning, CEO.

808
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,340
Good morning.

809
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:36,390
I know! How many times do you have to repeat yourself?

810
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,560
How annoying can you be?

811
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,030
I don't care what reason you use,

812
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,120
you have to do your best to stall Hu Chaoqin

813
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,020
to create time for Su Shanna and the others.

814
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,990
I understand,

815
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,560
but don't be too pleased with yourself.

816
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,020
It's because I'm taking the big picture into account

817
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:54,380
that I'm allying with a secondary enemy to fight the main enemy.

818
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,450
I understand. Hurry up and go in.

819
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:59,950
Hu Chaoqin should already be here.

820
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,080
Hi.

821
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,890
Are you looking for our CFO?

822
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:36,880
He's not here.

823
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,340
Let's go together.

824
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,950
Keep looking.

825
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:58,870
Uncle Hu, why did you suddenly ask to meet me?

826
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,380
Is there something you need?

827
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,680
It's nothing much actually.

828
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,740
I just wanted to celebrate your return to the company with a welcome dinner, Miss.

829
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,570
Uncle Hu, you're very kind.

830
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,040
I'm going to say something that sounds self-righteous.

831
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,040
Please don't take offense, Miss.

832
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,630
Actually, having watched all of you grow up, I feel like you're my own daughter in my heart.

833
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:26,080
That's why seeing you return in good health makes me happier than anyone else.

834
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:32,450
But not once did I expect that

835
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:35,110
Tianxing would return too.

836
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:45,540
That's right. He Tianxing fell from such a height, yet he didn't die.

837
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,970
As it turns out, it's true that bad things never die.

838
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:53,560
Uncle Hu, tell me. How is he any better than me?

839
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,880
How could he even compare to you?

840
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,440
Are you here to have a heart-to-heart talk?

841
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,830
Get to the point. Investigate the cash flow.

842
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:07,010
From now on, repeat after me.

843
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:10,880
Uncle Hu, you invited me here today to discuss He Tianxing, right?

844
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,890
So, Uncle Hu, you invited me here today to discuss He Tianxing, right?

845
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:19,380
Sure enough, you are exceptionally intelligent, Miss.

846
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,710
To be honest,

847
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:26,610
out of the entire He family, He Tianxing is the one with the business mind.

848
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:33,760
To be honest, out of the entire He family,

849
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,910
He Tianxing is the one with the business mind.

850
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:43,160
Why would I overestimate my abilities and try to compete with him?

851
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,670
Why would I overestimate my abilities and try to compete with him?

852
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,180
Don't you think this is such a joke?

853
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:56,820
Miss, you're too modest.

854
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,570
I don't even know how to write the word "modest."

855
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:04,030
However, I'm quite an expert at the word "bankruptcy."

856
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:08,960
After all, I toyed with so many companies into their collapse. Isn't that right?

857
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,500
He Tianxing, you're dead.

858
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,410
Great plans can be ruined by just a touch of impatience.

859
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:22,790
Also, stop adding your own lines.

860
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,040
That's how investments are. There are gains and losses.

861
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,530
It's fine. I will help you.

862
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,760
So what have you been investing in, Uncle Hu?

863
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,760
Are there any opportunities to make money?

864
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:46,620
As it happens, I have an antique chess set on me right now.

865
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,150
It has some value.

866
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,770
How much do you want for it?

867
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:53,140
NT$30 million (~US$1 million).

868
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,650
NT$30 million?

869
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,740
What kind of chess set is worth NT$30 million?

870
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,230
I haven't even seen so much as a shadow of the chess set,

871
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,470
and you want me to pull out NT$30 million?

872
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,550
It seems a bit expensive.

873
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,400
It's not expensive.

874
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:13,990
With just NT$30 million, you can resell it for double.

875
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:16,170
It's a guaranteed profit with no losses.

876
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:20,510
But Uncle Hu, you just said that there must be gains and losses in investment.

877
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:23,420
That's right. That's why I'm putting out the NT$30 million.

878
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,330
You just need to sign a form as a figurehead,

879
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:29,030
and then wait to earn your NT$30 million.

880
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,130
There's such a good opportunity?

881
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,930
Of course that's not a problem.

882
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:35,750
Thank you, Uncle Hu.

883
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,400
But since I'm helping you out,

884
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:43,830
I'd like to kindly ask you to help me with something.

885
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,940
Help with what?

886
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:55,280
Kick He Tianxing off the board of directors.

887
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,020
You were the one who saw through my disguise

888
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,910
and allowed me to experience feelings I've never felt before.

889
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:12,250
He Tianxing and Situ Aoran are like a loop.

890
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:17,430
Perhaps I'm seeing He Tianxing as Situ Aoran due to a projection of my innermost feelings.

891
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,860
Don't be like this. Don't make me confused.

892
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,630
Don't make me fall in love with you.

893
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,380
Why do you have to do so much for me,

894
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,260
and then now tell me that you don't want to fall in love with me?

895
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:29,960
You don't love me? Then let me love you.

896
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,770
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

897
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:44,920
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

898
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:50,420
♫ A quiet strike ♫

899
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,530
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

900
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:55,850
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

901
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:58,990
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

902
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:03,350
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

903
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:07,930
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

904
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:11,110
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

905
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:16,120
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

906
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:20,860
♫ If I could see you again ♫

907
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:27,550
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

908
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:31,690
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

909
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:40,870
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

910
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:44,690
♫ If you were a painter ♫

911
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:46,590
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

912
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:50,940
♫ No regrets ♫

913
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:56,980
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
