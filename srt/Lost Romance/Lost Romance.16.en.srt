Meeting you is the most miraculous thing that happened in my life.

This can’t be. I haven't said "I love you" yet.

I want to report a case.

The person who pushed the former CEO of Tianliang Group, He Tianxing, off the building

is the current chairman, He Tianjian.

And that's why Author Meng gave me a harsh scolding.

Wouldn't you say I was treated unfairly?

Why would I edit the contents for no reason?

The Zheng Xiao'en in the book isn't someone else.

Situ Aoran? Isn't that a character in a novel?

Do you have to be that dedicated to your work?

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,400
You mean that during the three months you were in a coma,

you went into the world of the story, CEO, You're So Naughty?

And with your physical condition like this, why are you looking for He Tianxing?

75

Don't tell me that Situ Aoran from CEO, You're So Naughty

76
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,140
is He Tianxing in real life?

No kidding.

How can a novel be the same as reality?

Okay, tell me.

The morning that Chuchu and Situ Aoran went to the hot spring, what did you guys eat for breakfast?

Canned pickled cucumbers, canned tuna, canned eel, and canned peaches.

85

Then how much did it cost to stay one night in a deluxe mountain view suite at the hot spring resort?

86
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,810
NT$50,000 (~US$1,700).

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,430
That night when the power went out

88
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,810
and you fell asleep next to Situ Aoran's bed,

89
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,510
who covered you with a blanket?

90
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,030
I don't know.

91
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,700
Who else could it be? It was Situ Aoran.

92
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,090
It was him?

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,420
It was really him?

94
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,930
So it was actually real?

95
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,210
It's real.

96
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,350
Qiutian, I need you to believe me.

97
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,540
I really need someone to believe me.

98
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,010
Otherwise, I'll feel like I'm going crazy.

99
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,550
I believe you.

100
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,940
Didn't I say that I believe you?

101
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,780
Why are you still crying?

102
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,620
I thought I just had a very long dream,

103
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,260
and no one would remember the me in the dream.

104
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,960
But this book shows me

105
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,490
that my relationship really existed

106
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,250
in a parallel universe.

107
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,090
That there was a person who was so good to me.

108
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,250
The way my heart beat wasn't fake.

109
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,280
I can't believe you actually went into the book.

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,210
How could this happen?

111
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,150
That's too extreme. And you didn't take me.

112
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,590
When I first went into the book, I was scared to death, okay?

113
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,240
Yeah, right. It looks to me like you had a great time.

114
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,660
See? As soon as you entered, you immediately started strategizing on how to get the CEO.

115
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,650
You even peeked at him while he was showering?!

116
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,320
You totally ruined the image of respectable women.

117
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,220
Goodness! I wasn't reading this attentively until now.

118
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,500
So your lip bled before because you tried to stop Chuchu and the CEO's relationship progress.

119
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,440
And you ended up kissing Chuchu?

120
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,250
Don't remind me.

121
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,580
No wonder your head bled that time.

122
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,680
It was also because of Chuchu?

123
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,240
Hey. Is Aoran the male lead or are you?

124
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,400
Aiyo, don't talk about it anymore.

125
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,970
Also, that one time I opened the bathroom stall and saw you,

126
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,680
I thought I was hallucinating,

127
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,310
but you were actually locked in there.

128
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,810
Who locked me in there?

129
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,770
Chuchu.

130
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,860
It wasn't Female Coworker #16 or #17?

131
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,040
It was Chuchu.

132
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,750
Tender and harmless character types can't stand being tested.

133
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,150
When the male lead gives her attention, she's a good person.

134
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,000
But once things don't go her way, her character starts breaking down.

135
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,150
As the author's female lead,

136
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,580
she probably couldn't face the sudden change.

137
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,420
Then what are you going to do now?

138
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,260
What do you mean? Chief Editor Yao won't let me come back to work at the publishing company?

139
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,710
No, He Tianxing. I'm talking about He Tianxing.

140
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,070
You're just going to give up?

141
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,930
What else can I do but give up?

142
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,620
I'll just treat it as a dream.

143
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,930
My Aoran will be paused forever at that wedding in the book.

144
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,690
Good night.

145
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,450
Ultimately, it's all Author Meng's fault.

146
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,000
Everything she writes ends with a wedding.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,180
Ending with a wedding is the most irresponsible kind of ending.

148
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,660
Yeah! There are many other kinds of endings to write.

149
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,930
Yeah, like going on a honeymoon!

150
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,780
Publicly displaying affection after the wedding.

151
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,560
Popping out a few kiddos who keep running around!

152
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,660
Starting a business together.

153
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,890
Going through life's hardships together.

154
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,750
To make it more of a Mary Sue character,

155
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,770
there could even be a third, fourth, or fifth male character written in.

156
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,750
She should've written at least 100,000 words.

157
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,950
She could've written it as a long epic story.

158
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,860
She should learn from Master Jin Yong.

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,220
After "The Legend," there was "The Return."

162
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,120
After "The Return," there was "The Heaven Sword."
(The three novels of The Condor Heroes trilogy)

163
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,960
But I already came back.

164
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,890
Would it work?

165
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
No matter what happens, we have to try.

166
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,990
It's better than doing nothing, right?

167
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,060
Get out!

168
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,240
What do you mean, sequel?

169
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,280
Are you complaining that the book sales weren't poor enough,

170
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,550
or that we didn't receive enough objection phone calls?

171
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,750
Author, don't say that!

172
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,100
You should rise from wherever you have fallen.

173
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,920
Let's face failure together. We can fly against the wind.

174
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,770
Not flying!

175
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,780
Forget it.

176
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,560
We should wait for her anger to subside before coming again.

177
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,900
Besides, you already had a happy ending in the novel.

178
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,190
The most beautiful things happen in a dream.

179
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,350
Happy ending?

180
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,130
Hey, have you ever read a novel about a guy who embarks on an adventure

181
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,480
to save his missing childhood sweetheart?

182
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,950
Super Mario?

183
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,460
No.

184
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,010
The male lead in the novel is called Chen Qing.

185
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,770
The story took place towards the end of the Qing Dynasty.

186
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,200
It's a story that's mostly for guys.

187
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,070
Searching far and wide, going through hell and high water, being fancied by millions of girls,

188
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,130
but he only cares deeply about his first love.

189
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,550
The type of story where he becomes a hero in the end.

190
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,460
This type of novel is not our publishing company's style.

191
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,200
Have you seen or heard of it?

192
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,740
No. I haven't seen it or heard of it.

193
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,560
Tianxing, Zheng Xiao'en disappeared.

194
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,980
I have no idea what she's thinking.

195
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,020
We told her to stay here to protect her.

196
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,140
Who does she think she is?

197
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,220
Does she think being rescued on a random street just happens?

198
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't think she thought that way.

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're taking her side?

200
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,350
Just judging by the matter.

201
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,200
She's not obligated to work with us.

202
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,390
Have Jason spend some of his time looking out for her.

203
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,610
Understood.

204
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,430
These are some of our company's latest investment projects. Chairman, please review.

205
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,120
Uncle Hu, I already looked into it with my lawyers.

206
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,530
Currently, the police only has Zheng Xiao'en's witness statement.

207
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,740
And whether her statement can be used as evidence or not

208
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,460
is a problem in and of itself.

209
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,200
With regards to all the other evidence that we should be worried about,

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,030
my sister has already completely destroyed it all.

211
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,680
When the police come to me,

212
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,930
they won't be able to do anything to me if I deny everything.

213
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,850
Are you sure He Mingli destroyed all the evidence?

214
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,570
You find this absurd?

215
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,440
There’s something even more absurd.

216
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,160
He Tianjian is the chairman right now.

217
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,700
Dad passed away.

218
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,690
When did he pass away?

219
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,320
Why didn't anyone tell me?

220
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,900
You don’t have to look at me like that.

221
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,020
When Dad died, I didn't get to see him for the last time either.

222
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,510
At least in this regard,

223
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,460
we finally enjoyed fair treatment for once.

224
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,430
Fair? He Mingli.

225
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,060
Don't you think that's laughable coming from you?

226
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,590
From the beginning,

227
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,340
you've never been fair towards me.

228
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,390
He Mingli, what are you doing? Give me back my bag.

229
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,260
Are you ready?

230
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,770
Sis, do we really have to do this?

231
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,940
It was just Dad’s birthday party.

232
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,700
Auntie, bad news! Tianxing fell in the river just now!

233
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,780
It was just that my mom and I were invited.

234
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,290
Auntie, over here. Hurry!

235
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,610
What gave you guys the right to

236
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,850
Tianxing!

237
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,430
take advantage of a mother’s selfless love

238
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,050
and separate us forever?
Mom! Mom! Wake up!

239
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,650
Don't die, Mom!

240
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,500
Mom!

241
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,980
I'll never forget the look on your face that day.

242
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,600
I know.

243
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,480
You’ve just been waiting for an opportunity,

244
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,460
even though that was an accident.

245
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,230
You caused my mom's death.

246
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,270
I don't care whether you admit it or not.

247
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,950
I don't care if there's proof or not.

248
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,920
I don't care whether it was an accident or not.

249
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,980
I know that you caused my mom's death.

250
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,760
Don't you have anything else to say?

251
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,740
It's been so many years.

252
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,080
Don't you feel any guilt?

253
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,840
Do you sleep well at night?

254
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,000
You're still the same.

255
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,360
You only think about how you've been wronged.

256
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,970
What about me?

257
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,610
What did your mom do to us?

258
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,030
Don't you know?

259
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,830
Where's Mom?

260
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,240
Mom, open the door!

261
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,370
Mom!

262
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:14,270
Mom, wake up!

263
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,670
My dad didn't come back that day.

264
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,900
Even though my mom tried to commit suicide,

265
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,140
he still didn't come back.

266
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,990
They promised to come see my performance that day.

267
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,770
But because my mom found out my dad was having an affair with his assistant

268
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,490
and was pregnant with you,

269
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,270
they broke their promise.

270
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,710
From that moment on,

271
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,300
I no longer had a happy, blissful family.

272
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,590
Your mom destroyed my family.

273
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,250
God wanted her to pay the price for it! Is there anything wrong with that?

274
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,430
She only got what she deserved. It was retribution.

275
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,420
Retribution!

276
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
It’s exactly the same.

277
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,550
It's the same look as back then.

278
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,660
He Tianxing,

279
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,560
I know you'll never forgive me.

280
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,560
I'm the same.

281
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,160
I will never forgive you and your mother.

282
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,270
Dad is gone.

283
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,670
I'm very sad.

284
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,830
But my sadness is different from yours.

285
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,380
You lost a supporter,

286
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,900
a loving father.

287
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,670
But I'm different.

288
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,690
My regret is

289
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,430
that he left just like that.

290
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,480
He didn't even get a chance to tell me he was sorry.

291
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,300
He Mingli!

292
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't be so harsh.

293
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,220
Even though this is the kind of person you are,

294
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,560
Dad never loved you less.

295
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,210
Loved me?

296
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,890
Loved me so much that he forgot I existed?

297
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,350
Loved me so much that my name wasn't even on his will?

298
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,760
You're really just like Dad said.

299
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,990
Your personality ruined your life.

300
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,570
No matter if it is good or bad,

301
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,980
your bad temper will always destroy everything.

302
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,850
And it's the most rotten kind of destruction,

303
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,050
the kind without any chance of turning back.

304
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,470
Okay.

305
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,520
I don't think we'll ever meet again.

306
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,330
He Mingli!

307
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,730
Doctor, Doctor!

308
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,730
Where did He Mingli go?

309
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,330
A family member came to take care of her discharge.

310
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,300
What family member?

311
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,420
I'm her family!

312
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,410
Besides me, who else is He Mingli's family?

313
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,360
Could it be He Tianxing?

314
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,030
Who took her away?

315
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,460
Xu Qiongmei.

316
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,130
Who?

317
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,740
Why would my mom take her away?

318
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,690
This is my friend's villa.

319
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,620
It's far from the city.

320
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,390
No one will disturb you.

321
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,690
Just get a good rest here.

322
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,760
Don't think about anything else.

323
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,730
I don't think we'll ever meet again.

324
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,490
- Mingli.
- Mom.

325
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,020
This is the memorandum of Dad's will.

326
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,080
Take a look yourself.

327
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,000
Don't think about any unhappy things.

328
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,960
Did you know? If Tianxing hadn't revealed the memorandum of the will,

329
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,280
I wouldn't have known that your father left a large sum of money for you.

330
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,390
Your father knew your personality and was afraid you'd spend the money recklessly,

331
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,780
so after he put the money in a trust,

332
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,660
he appointed Tianxing as the manager of that trust.

333
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,180
Tianxing told me a lot of things.

334
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,710
He said your father often talked to him about you.

335
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,350
Of his three kids, he worried the most about you

336
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,030
because you're too impulsive and therefore easy to swindle.

337
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,870
So he wanted Tianxing to look after you.

338
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,680
Who's the insider and who's the outsider?

339
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,830
Aren't you all my children with my last name?

340
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,970
Why are you differentiating insiders and outsiders?

341
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,630
I'm still alive,

342
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,500
and you're splitting my family right in front of me?

343
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,490
Then should I just die now?

344
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,030
We'll do as Tianxing said regarding this matter.

345
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,030
No more nonsense.

346
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,870
Tianxing. Tianxing.

347
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,650
Whenever he talks, it's always about Tianxing.

348
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,420
He's the son of that woman.

349
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,210
Or am I the only who ever cared about that?

350
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,050
That's all in the past.

351
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,050
Your father has already passed away.

352
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,720
What good does it do to stay angry?

353
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,880
So I'm the only one who cared about this family.

354
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,170
All these years, whom have I been rebelling for?

355
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,730
And I never would have thought

356
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,590
that the first one to come and visit me at the psychiatric hospital

357
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,020
would be my biggest enemy in life.

358
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,670
The one who locked me up in the psychiatric hospital

359
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,210
was my closest family.

360
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,590
Mom, did you know?

361
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,740
I was really afraid in there.

362
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,470
I was afraid I'd gone mad for real.

363
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,100
I was afraid I'd never get out again.

364
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,740
Every day...

365
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,680
Every day, I was waiting for you to come and rescue me.

366
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,830
But you never came, not even once.

367
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,460
I wanted to visit you.

368
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,040
But you didn't come, not even once.

369
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,990
I-It was Tianjian who told me I should let you rest.

370
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,600
You didn't come to see me, not even once.

371
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,810
I was afraid your weren't mentally stable.

372
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:11,670
You didn't come to see me, not even once.

373
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,750
Mom, I just want to know

374
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,200
if it weren't for this sum of inheritance that Tianxing revealed,

375
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,180
would you have come see me?

376
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,840
What are you saying?

377
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,630
The current chairman of the company is Tianjian.

378
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,960
Why would I covet your inheritance money?

379
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,400
Your personality is very annoying.

380
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,010
It makes one think it isn't worth being nice to you.

381
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,420
Enough. I won't disturb you any longer.

382
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,950
You take good care of yourself.

383
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,090
[Ruge Publishing]

384
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,700
This one! This male lead is named Chen Qing.

385
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,950
And the female lead?

386
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,870
Lin Enfei.

387
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,220
That's not it.

388
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,960
The female lead is supposed to be named Liu Mushuang.

389
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,720
The background is wrong.

390
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,810
There's nothing at all.

391
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:53,660
We don't know the author, publisher, or when it was published.

392
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,450
We only know the basic plot.

393
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,630
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

394
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,920
Please keep looking.

395
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,770
The story is almost completely written.

396
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,080
There's no way no trace was left behind.

397
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,400
Isn't he just a fictional character?

398
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,500
Is this necessary?

399
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,020
It's necessary.

400
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,100
In that world, he was like another you.

401
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,550
When I needed help, he was there.

402
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,260
When I was at a loss, he was also there.

403
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,270
If I knew you were constantly wandering around and drifting about,

404
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,660
I would feel uneasy every day.

405
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,760
Okay. He was indeed very sincere towards you.

406
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,050
Of course. He was my best friend in the book.

407
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,990
What friend! He liked you!

408
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,960
Look, he said, "It's because of you." Okay?

409
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,750
How is that possible?

410
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,560
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

411
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,580
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

412
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:33,190
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

413
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,220
There's nothing at all.

We don't know the author, publisher, or when it was published.

Please keep looking.

There's no way no trace was left behind.

420
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,790
Isn't he just a fictional character?

421
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,760
Is this necessary?

422
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,370
It's necessary.

423
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,530
In that world, he was like another you.

424
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,960
When I needed help, he was there.

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,640
When I was at a loss, he was also there.

00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,430
Of course. He was my best friend in the book.

430
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,470
What friend! He liked you!

431
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:44,190
Look, he said, "It's because of you." Okay?

432
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,130
Is it because you want someone to accompany you,

433
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,340
or is it because of me?

434
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,970
It's because of you.

435
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,320
It's just that this answer no longer has any meaning.

436
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,040
At least I tried my best for once.

437
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,960
I don't regret falling in love with an alien.

438
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,750
How is that possible?

439
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,570
Oh my god, I'm so slow.

440
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,940
I'm so hurtful.

441
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,920
If you knew when you were in the book,

442
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,670
would that have changed your decision?

443
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,070
Feelings are just this way.

444
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,790
Come on.

445
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,530
Let's give him a good ending.

446
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,710
We have to. Even if I'm not happy,

447
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,030
Qingfeng has to be happy.

448
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,260
Perfect men really only exist in novels.

449
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,510
In real life, you can't find one.

450
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,450
Xiao'en, are you feeling better?

451
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,500
Thank you, Chief Editor.

452
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,290
- I'm doing alright.
- That's great.

453
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,920
A get well gift.

454
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,450
Thank you.

455
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,820
Since you're feeling better, do you have any new ideas?

456
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,960
You can bring them up.

457
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,420
- What?
- What do you mean "what"?

458
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,300
For three months, you've probably slept enough.

459
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,420
It's about time to contribute to the company.

460
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,710
Our publishing company suffered big losses because of CEO, You're So Naughty.

461
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,360
Do you two know that?

462
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,510
You're still not thinking about how to increase sales?

463
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,990
I'm giving you five minutes to come up with new ideas.

464
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,310
Our mighty editor is so right.

465
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,180
Actually, romance novels have reached a bottleneck.

466
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,560
We should really walk along a new path.

467
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,050
Very good. If you have any ideas, feel free to speak up.

468
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,790
- Let's open up the male market.
- Rejected.

469
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,130
Didn't you say you wanted a new direction?

470
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,880
I meant a new direction for satisfying women's fantasies!

471
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,640
Doesn't the publishing company next door have some priest or pastor series?

472
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,710
Could you bring out your creativity and find something?

473
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,390
A monk series?

474
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,980
Who are you going to find to write it? A temple attendant? A shaman?

475
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,930
Please! Come up with something useful, okay?

476
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,700
I don't care. Find a topic that will really sell.

477
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,010
Otherwise, if the next book also incurs a loss,

478
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,390
then I'll deduct printing expenses from your salary.

479
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,700
Good luck. Excuse me.

480
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,370
Good luck.

481
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,770
Chief Editor Yao is so blind.

482
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,760
He only knows to tell us to find a new direction.

483
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,700
After thinking of a bunch, he only changed the broth and not the medicine.

484
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,620
He only wants to go the conservative route.

485
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,480
Watch. The sales will conservatively fall.

486
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,820
Zheng Xiao'en.

487
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,190
That's not right. I must have seen Qingfeng somewhere before.

488
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,130
- I need to find him.
- No, wait.

489
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,770
There are so many people here. Where are you going to go to find Qingfeng?

490
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,790
The bookstore. I want to confirm which books he's wandering in.

491
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,280
How are you going to confirm it? Zheng Xiao'en!

492
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,050
Today's physical therapy ends here.

493
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,650
I looked into Tianliang Group's current situation.

494
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,120
It's like you guessed.

495
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,150
After Tianliang Hospitality was acquired, under Hu Chaoqin's leadership,

496
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,610
Tianliang Construction, Tianliang Textile,

497
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,530
Tianliang Digital, and Tianliang Transportation

498
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,160
were used to continue investments in various venture capital companies registered in the Cayman Islands.

499
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,280
What about the earnings?

500
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,060
They're all long-term investments.

501
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,580
On the financial report, it doesn't look problematic.

502
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,400
Just because there are no problems right now

503
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,010
doesn't mean there won't be problems in the future.

504
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,550
I'm afraid that Tianliang will eventually be hollowed out by Uncle Hu.

505
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,710
But... the problem is that all of this is lawful,

506
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,310
whether you look at it from a financial standpoint or from a legal standpoint.

507
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,490
If his plan really is to empty it out, what should we do?

508
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,660
It's not that we don't have a way,

509
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,520
but if we only depend on ourselves,

510
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,440
I'm afraid that we won't be able to stop him.

511
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,940
I don't think He Mingli will want to work with us.

512
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,730
Shanna.

513
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:44,610
What I asked Jason to do... how is that going?

514
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,670
I don't understand why you care so much about the peeper.

515
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,360
Jason said he didn't see anything abnormal,

516
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,270
but one thing is pretty weird.

517
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,490
During the three months you were in a coma,

518
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,520
Zheng Xiao'en was also in a coma for unknown reasons.

519
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Also for three months?

520
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,720
Look! There's a Qing.

521
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,320
This Wei Qing is an old confused man

522
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,050
who keeps getting in the way of the male and female leads' romance.

523
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,190
No. This isn't it.

524
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,430
Li Hanqing.

525
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,050
At the end, he couldn't get over it

526
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,450
and hung himself.

527
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,340
No, no, absolutely not.

528
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,270
Committing suicide at such a young age?

529
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,060
Our Supreme Master would never commit suicide.

530
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,700
Now we're getting somewhere. Xu Qingqing.

531
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:27,430
This name...

532
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,760
how come I have a bad premonition?

533
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,480
That's right. This one is about a famous courtesan from a brothel.

534
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,010
The kind where you sell both your art and body.

535
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,150
Her first time was when she was twelve.

536
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,850
It was even up for public bidding at the hundred-flower tower?

537
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,470
How could the author write something like this?

538
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,730
Don't be angry.

539
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,950
I'm not angry.

540
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,070
I'm worried.

541
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,180
My Supreme Master...

542
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,160
Is he okay?

543
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,840
Zheng Xiao'en, don't scare yourself.

544
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,960
Qingfeng's ending is definitely not the tragic kind.

545
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,570
It won't be.

546
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,000
It doesn't matter which book he appears in. It wouldn't happen.

547
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,440
Don't worry. You just came back.

548
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,670
Maybe the author hasn't even finished setting up the characters yet.

549
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,540
You don't have any more eggs.

550
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,550
And laundry soap.

551
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,530
Can we give him a better character?

552
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,240
Then he can be the male lead character.

553
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,720
That's not right.

554
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,130
According to what you said before, he probably hasn't been the male lead before.

555
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,240
It smells so good.

556
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,460
This is a scent that Aoran likes.

557
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,980
Zheng Xiao'en, what are you doing?

558
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,600
Are you buying all these to take a bath in them?

559
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,170
This is the scent from my memory.

560
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,810
You bought so much. Are you trying to drink them?

561
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,930
Why do you care?

562
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,420
When did your neighborhood turn into a luxury residential area?

563
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,550
What do you mean?

564
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,970
Should I be registering for witness protection?

565
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:11,000
Slowly move in the three o'clock direction.

566
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,390
Zheng Xiao'en.

567
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,190
Zheng Xiao'en?

568
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,240
♫ I lost to you ♫

569
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:47,300
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

570
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,570
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

571
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:56,670
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

572
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:03,160
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

573
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,130
When did your neighborhood turn into a luxury residential area?

574
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,000
What do you mean?

575
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,630
Should I be registering for witness protection?

576
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,600
Slowly move in the three o'clock direction.

577
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,030
Zheng Xiao'en.

578
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,960
Zheng Xiao'en?

579
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,300
That hurt.

580
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,020
There's not much time left.

581
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,140
If you can...

582
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,000
I can, I can.

583
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,000
Can you stop staring at me?

584
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,070
I'm sorry.

585
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,840
For what?

586
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,800
For staring at you,

587
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,690
and for watching you before.

588
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,350
You mean spying on him, right?

589
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,480
That's right.

590
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,730
It's spy—

591
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,260
I'm sorry.

592
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,020
Before, I wasn't able to make a formal apology.

593
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,960
I'm sorry.

594
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,770
Knowing that someone kept on...

595
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,080
observing me

596
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,480
is not a good feeling indeed.

597
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,000
But there's something I'm curious about.

598
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,490
Why were you watching me?

599
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,060
Because you encouraged me.

600
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,050
Setbacks. Everyone encounters various setbacks daily.

601
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,840
Including myself, of course.

602
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,900
And... maybe I encounter them more than others do.

603
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,520
Then how do you face setbacks?

604
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,790
In a storm, you have to be like an adult.

605
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,650
In beautiful weather, you have to be like a child.

606
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,890
As a corporate slave and an insignificant loser,

607
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,940
I face 9,999 ruthless setbacks in life every day.

608
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,950
Your existence is like an oasis in the desert

609
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,970
and a small comfort in a hard and bitter life.

610
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,540
From under the shower head, stealing—

611
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,390
The shower head?

612
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,120
(In episode 4, she said the sight of him was "a little bit of happiness stolen from the shower head.")

613
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,520
What I mean is, in addition to your life and your work being very inspiring,

614
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,730
your existence in itself is a type of encouragement.

615
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,410
- Because you—
- Are handsome!

616
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,030
So that gives you the right to spy on the CEO for so long? Is that it?

617
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,130
That's not it. It really was a coincidence.

618
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,010
It's just that we are frequently scolded by the chief editor.

619
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,790
And since we were scolded, we needed a place to escape to.

620
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,340
- So we went up to the rooftop.
- Played with the drone.

621
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,720
And accidentally discovered the handsome guy in the building next door.

622
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,110
And then accidentally discovered that the handsome guy was the CEO on the magazine.

623
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,020
A small soul gained large comfort.

624
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,240
Don't laugh. Do you think looking like that is easy?

625
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,160
Everything has a purpose for its existence.

626
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,690
Just like how your appearance can comfort others,

627
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,520
our publishing company's novels

628
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,550
can light up the hearts of thousands of young girls.

629
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,770
Even though we can't choose how we were born and raised,

630
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,900
we can at least dream.

631
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,510
Weirdo.

632
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,220
Don’t worry.

633
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,100
Everything’s fine.

634
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,610
Weirdo.

635
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:41,770
♫ I lost to you ♫

636
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:51,500
♫ All of the innocent romance was lost to you ♫

637
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,830
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

638
00:50:54,830 --> 00:51:00,950
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

639
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:07,400
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

640
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,310
Let’s go.

641
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:29,550
- Then I’ll also—
- Did I do something wrong that day?

642
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,500
Which day?

643
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,330
The day you were attacked because of your police report.

644
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,070
What’s wrong?

645
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,940
Are you okay?

646
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,970
Are you... afraid of the dark?

647
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:09,330
I... am not afraid of the dark.

648
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:12,230
I’m sorry, I was mistaken. Good night.

649
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,070
No. Why would you think that?

650
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,920
Because I could sense that you didn’t like my answer.

651
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,620
No.

652
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:35,600
You keep looking at me with a can't-bear-to-let-you-go expression

653
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,280
as though I’ve let you down.

654
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,590
We...

655
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,900
What do you mean can't bear to let go?

656
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,690
It was probably more like can't really express it,

657
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,530
like I can't get the words out.

658
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,240
Just like...

659
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,270
My stomach really hurts. Why isn’t the car here yet?

660
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,260
This kind of expression.

661
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,700
Then why did you suddenly leave that day?

662
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,070
Is it very important to know whether I’m afraid of the dark?

663
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:22,630
Or... does this question have a special meaning?

664
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,380
It has no meaning. Not to you.

665
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,020
You witnessed me falling off the building,

666
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,190
but you didn’t call the police immediately after.

667
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,280
So why did you suddenly report it to the police now?

668
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:54,650
I didn’t dare to before.

669
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,590
I’m really just an ordinary corporate slave and an insignificant loser.

670
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,640
The type that people on the streets see and don’t remember.

671
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,340
A dime a dozen.

672
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,750
It’s natural that my boss scolds me.

673
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,180
If I express that I find it humiliating,

674
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,660
it'll cause my boss to be embarrassed.

675
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,510
This version of me has only pursued one thing in my life.

676
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,260
What is it?

677
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,130
To live peacefully, one day at a time.

678
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,170
In any case, I'm not anyone special.

679
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,360
Even if I said I witnessed it,

680
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,300
people might not believe me.

681
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,040
Even if someone believed me, who will that affect?

682
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,480
The evidence must be long gone.

683
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:45,080
If that’s the case, why did you still walk into the police station?

684
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:54,230
Because several things happened recently,

685
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:58,610
which made me realize that even if I look like I'm nothing special,

686
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,510
as long as I do my best,

687
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,960
I can also have the opportunity to encounter a miracle.

688
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:08,130
Several things happened recently?

689
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,000
Weren’t you unconscious for three months?

690
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,530
It’s because I was unconscious for three months

691
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,060
and was still able to wake up. It’s practically a miracle.

692
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,190
I've encountered life's surprises and miracles.

693

I specially gave you space.

709
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,420
Did you tell him everything?

710
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,940
Tell him what?

711
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,440
The extraordinary story of you and He Tianxing.

712
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,430
How you entered the novel because of him

713
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,700
and how you both fell in love.

714
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,500
Entering the novel was an accident.

715
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,000
But the falling in love part was real, right? How did it go?

716
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:34,120
I didn't tell him.

717
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,870
Why?

718
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,300
That was such a good opportunity.

719
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,700
He even came to look for you of his own accord.

720
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:48,320
Because... even falling in love was fake.

721
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,460
How could that be?

722
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,310
Surely I can’t tell him,

723
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,930
"Hello, Mr. He."

724
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:01,100
"Even though I'm calling you Mr. He, you actually love me very much."

725
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:05,800
"You've gone through hell and high water for me and even proposed to me."

726
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,060
"You'd say a bunch of pickup lines to me every day."

727
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,320
Hello, is this 110? There's a crazy woman here.
(110 is Taiwan's emergency number.)

728
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,780
She said that Andy Lau is her dad and He Tianxing is her husband.

729
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,670
Come here quickly and take her away.

It’s okay. It’s okay. You can just win him over again.

732
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,910
Stop messing around.

733
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,310
How am I messing around?

734
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,770
You managed to win him over once.

735
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,850
Why can’t you win him over for the second time?

736
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,890
In the novel, I dared to say those shameless things because it was a novel.

737
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:04,710
But in reality, before I can even get close to him,

738
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,380
I'm already pulled away by the security guards.

739
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,400
Now, the only thing I can do...

740

[CEO's Sweetheart Electrician]

743
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:55,490
- These are...
- The CEO asked me to buy these books from Ruge Publishing.

744
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,920
They were edited by Miss Zheng.

CEO's Sweetheart Electrician?

746
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,130
This cover is quite cute.

01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,800
Do you guys know what these are?

748
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,540
They're chick-lit romances.

749
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,510
What's that?

750
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:14,920
They're stories specifically about the love between a man and a woman.

751
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,320
Oh, love stories, like Romeo and Juliet?

752
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,550
It's similar, but they're not simply love stories.

753
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,470
They're love stories that are designed to satisfy the female fantasy.

754
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:29,280
I understand. They're like wuxia novels.
(Wuxia is a popular martial arts chivalry genre)

755
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,340
For example, the male lead has to serendipitously pick up a book of martial arts secrets.

756
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,700
And then the female lead has to be super gorgeous.

757
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,540
And then before he becomes the leader of the martial arts circle,

758
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,100
he must undergo all sorts of trials and tribulations, right?

759
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,940
Right, just like that.

760
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,530
They're basically wuxia novels for girls.

761
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,340
The male and female leads must have a special encounter.

762
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,240
The male lead is a man who wields power and influence.

763
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,370
The two will definitely experience ups and downs in their relationship.

764
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,930
You know this so well. Do you read them often?

No.

A kiss is a kiss. Why does he have to hold her by the waist

813
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,100
and push her up against the wall while kissing her?

814
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:10,010
Also, why is he constantly flashing an evil smile?

815
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:13,670
A smile that's kuáng... juān?

♫ Bravely love ♫

817
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,460
This word is read as juàn instead of juān (tonal difference).

818
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,720
Kuáng refers to being extreme.

819
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,310
Juàn refers to being reserved.

820
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:44,320
So is a smile that's kuángjuàn extreme or reserved?

821
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,420
It's so hard to understand.

This book is very profound.

So waking up to a kiss in the morning is supposed to be sweet.

824
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,240
Shouldn't they brush their teeth first?

825
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,180
Did they really not brush their teeth?

826
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,360
Everything has a purpose for its existence.

- Mom, you're the one who took Sis out?
- Yes.

838
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,900
Didn't I already tell you that she'd come back once she's better?

839
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,300
Why were you in such a hurry?

840
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,570
Are you blaming me for bringing Mingli back?

841
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,950
What's with both of you blaming me?

842
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,330
It was wrong to bring her back, and it was wrong to not bring her back.

843
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:58,170
You're both mistaking my goodwill for ill intent.

Okay, okay, okay. That's not what I meant.

846
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:08,270
What I meant was just that Sis hasn't recovered yet.

847
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:11,520
Why do you have to insist on bringing her out now?

848
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:15,520
That's why there has to be a man in the household.

849
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,270
Only you would have her best interests at heart.

850
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:21,550
She even misunderstands that we don't care about her.

Young Master, someone's looking for you.

everyone who was on the rooftop that day is required to come assist with the investigation.
