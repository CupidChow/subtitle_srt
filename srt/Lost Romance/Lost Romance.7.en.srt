- Careful—
- No!

163
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,920
Thank you for taking me home.

164
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,780
No problem.

165
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,950
You're injured.

166
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,770
Don't forget to put on medicine when you get home.

167
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,600
Good night.

168

Good night.

169
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,020
It hurts.

170
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,430
Why do I feel like no matter what I do, it's futile?

171
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,960
Such a dummy.

172
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,730
She wanted to ruin our relationship and ended up hurting herself.

Xiao'en, I'm here.

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,250
I brought your favorite snack for you. Ta-da!

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,870
When I took these out before, you always fought me for them.

177
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,030
But I realized what you said was completely right.

178
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,810
Eating an entire bag by yourself isn't as tasty as eating half a bag.

179
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,420
I left half of the bag especially for you.

What's with this hospital?

How can you be covered in bruises just lying in bed?

What was I saying?

189
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,110
I was watching today's press conference,

190

and I found out that there's a He Tianjian in the He family.

What's wrong?

Just... something I want to talk to you about.

198
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,460
Is it a work matter or a personal matter?

199

A personal matter.

200

Zheng Xiao'en confessed to you.

How did you know?

202
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,670
She didn't go crazy; she's being serious.

203
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,080
How did you know I think she's crazy? You can read my brain waves?

204
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,970
How long have I known you for?

205
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,700
How could I not know what you're thinking?

206
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,610
So you already knew that she liked me?

207
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,990
Then why didn't you tell me?

208
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,730
If she didn't say anything, why would I?

209
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,130
So you sent her to my house to help her?

210
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,980
Yes and no. She did know how to fix the toilet, right?

211
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,950
That's right, but I still feel like something's off.

212
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,220
She also followed me to the hot spring resort.

213

She also took you to the hospital.

- What?

- I thought she went to the hot spring resort to—
- What?

218
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,860
To cause trouble for Chuchu.

219
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,510
Just how terrible do you think she is?

220
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,870
But— she's not friendly to Chuchu.

221

You can't deny that.

222
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,160
It's true that some of her actions are hard to understand.

223
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,940
But have you thought about why she doesn't want you to know that she took you to the hospital?

224
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,880
Why?

225
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,280
It's because she was afraid you'd be repulsed by her.

226
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,640
Aoran, you don't have to accept her feelings,

227
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,300
but don't question her sincerity.

228
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,280
She's really not a bad person.

Maybe you've misunderstood Zheng Xiao'en from the beginning.

I hope it doesn't disrupt your work.

Is he really bothered that I kissed his white lotus?

283

She was probably just running her mouth like she usually does, right?

284
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,610
Why does he keep staring at my mouth?

285
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,500
Could it be that he wants to steal the kiss back from me?

There’s just no way. This woman is crazy.

323
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,830
I know that I was wrong. I'm sorry.

324
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,210
Please! I really need this job!

325
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,500
Please!

326
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,940
Fine. I won't hold it against you this time.

327
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,500
Don't do it next time.

328
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,440
Boss, thank you! Thank you!

329
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,100
It's just two teardrops. Zheng Xiao'en, you can do it!

330
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,970
What does this mean?

331
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,400
No one can measure my feelings with money.

332
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,210
God, I can't even act out the survival scene that I thought of.

333
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,140
Wait.

334
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,830
Isn't there anything you want to say to me?

335
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,320
What else is there to say?

336
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,630
In any case, you've already concluded that you don't want to see me anymore. Isn't that right?

337
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

338
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,440
When did I say that I don't want to see you anymore?

339
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,040
You want to straddle two boats?

340
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,230
A boat like you doesn't even catch my eye.

341
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,840
I know that I'm overestimating my abilities by trying to change the ending,

342

but I won't stop dreaming just because of your words.

Don't think about striking me down.

344

If you don't want to see me, I'll just leave.

I'm not firing you.

348

It's just not appropriate for you to keep living in my house right now.

Report to the office tomorrow.

350
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,420
I can go back to the office?

351
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,020
But it doesn't mean that I trust you.

352
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,530
I will continue to keep my eye on you.

353
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,540
You better continue to keep your distance from Chuchu.

354
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,010
You want me to go back to the office, and you want me to stay away from her—

355
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,340
Okay, okay! No problem.

356
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,240
If someone is willing to turn back three times from the same place,

357
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,600
then she can take it.

358
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,940
Thank you, Boss!

359
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,460
What is this about her feelings being real?

360
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,110
Qingfeng lied to me.

361
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,250
I can't bear to leave you!

362
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,730
Without you, who will protect my spine?

363
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,760
It's easy to from a frugal lifestyle to a luxurious one.

364
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,200
It's hard to go from a luxurious lifestyle to a frugal one.

365
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,840
The stock went up over ten thousand points and is now falling.

366
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,330
It makes me feel a little sad.

367
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,300
At this time, I want to encourage myself by saying the words of a passionate youth.

368
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,470
At this time, I want to encourage myself by saying a line from an overbearing CEO.

369
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,310
What line?

370
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,970
What overbearing CEO?

371
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,660
You just foolishly reply to anything people say.

372
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,840
Are you even overbearing?

373
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,290
It's for the better. I don't have to adjust my behavior based on your mood.

374
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,400
Proper cleaning is the basic expectation.

375
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,820
Messing around is the basic expectation.

376
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,850
I don't want my house to seem messy.

377
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,670
I don't want the house to seem clean.

378
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:06,060
So all the furniture that you see must return to its original place after use.

379
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:13,750
So all the furniture that you see must be in total disorder after use.

380
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,640
I don't like strong smells.

381
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,600
I love strong smells the most.

382
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:24,420
So things like scallions, garlic, and pickled vegetables are absolutely not allowed in the fridge.

383
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm going stuff you full of scallions, ginger, garlic, pickled vegetables, chives, chili peppers, and hot sauce.

Curse my good memory.

386
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,770
Since you like clean fridges, I'll give you back a clean fridge.

387
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,190
I won't even leave a drop of ketchup for you.

388
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,970
I won't leave even one for you to eat.

389
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,710
I'll eat it all!

390
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,330
Now for some steamed fish.

391
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,030
And microwave stewed egg!

480
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,910
Everyone's waiting for you. Baoxiong, hurry up!

481
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,140
The new department head is here!

482
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,190
May I ask who all these people are?

483
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,240
They are all our factory workers.

484
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,220
Wait, I think you got it wrong.

485
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,830
I'm looking for Tianliang's entrepreneurship department.

486
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,250
That's right! This is Tianliang's entrepreneurship department's only business,

487
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:08,270
Tianliang Sakura Shrimp Processing Plant!

488
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,360
I really don't understand.

489
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,270
Why would you transfer Tianjian to such a remote factory?

490
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,780
It's nothing. I just feel like he needs to sharpen his skills.

491
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,410
You clearly know that there's very little output from that factory.

492
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,390
The reason that the old chairman didn't close it down was

493
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,720
because he wanted to take care of those old workers.

494
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,310
He wanted to wait until they retired to slowly prepare to close it.

495
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:47,580
Besides, Tianjian is the chief human resources officer.

496
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,890
Why would you suddenly—

497
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,740
It's because I'm afraid that he has forgotten that he's the CHRO.

498
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,480
He's always doing extra work.

499
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,890
I watched the three of you grow up.

500
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,240
I really can't bear to see

501
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,180
you all kill each other.

502
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,730
Moreover, you say sharpen skills?

503
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,910
- The chairwoman really has something she's busy with.
- You dare to stop me?

504
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,200
Do you not know who I am? Move.

505
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,500
- Madam, I'm really sorry.
- Move!

506
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,550
- Mingli!
- Madam.

507
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,550
Close the door.

508
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,900
How can you transfer your brother to that kind of run-down factory?

509
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,880
How can you can bear to see your brother suffer like that?

510
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,210
Don't have a fit over something small like this at the company.

511
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,040
Tianjian is the one who is going to take over the company in the future.

512
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,100
Forget that you're not quickly finding a way for the entire company to trust him,

513
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,310
but you even transferred him to that deserted place!

514
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,240
Who will still recognize him in the future?

515
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,660
I told you to pave a path for him.

516
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,690
Where have you paved that path to?

517
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,390
If he has the skills, he can come back on his own.

518
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,870
I don't care. No matter what, you must call him back today.

519
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,750
If he doesn't come back,

520
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,980
I'm not leaving today.

521
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,940
Qiaozhi.

522
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,140
Go pour some tea.

523
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,960
Bring the entire kettle. My mom's not leaving today.

524
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:22,880
Mingli!

525
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,980
I still have things to do, so I won't keep you company.

526
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,590
He Mingli! Stand still!

527
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:30,110
Don't leave! Mingli!

528
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,380
You're making me so mad!

529
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,540
After today's budae jjigae's test, I officially declare that

530
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,140
I'm big spice girl, you're medium spice girl,
("spice girl" can also be translated as "sexy girl")

531
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,350
and you're small spice girl.

532
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:51,290
Then I'm going to use my rights as a little manager to take the big spice girl position.

533
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,480
I'm going to use my shamelessness to let you know

534
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,920
that I am the big spice girl.

535
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:10,120
Why do I feel like Boss is more handsome after not seeing him for half a day?

536
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,890
Is he walking towards me right now?

537
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,310
I don't believe that in this whole lobby,

538
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:49,550
there isn't a tall and strong woman who can block the CEO's eyes from seeing Chuchu.

539
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:53,520
You have to believe it. Nobody can block it.

540
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,590
As they are the writer's product, the error rate is not subject to the satellite position,

541

atmospheric environment, and receiver's limits in the Super Precision Global Positioning System.

542
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,090
It's short for Super GPS.

543
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,010
Thank you.

544
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,070
Have you eaten yet?

545
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:16,600
I haven't. I was just discussing with Qingfeng what we were going to eat.

546
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,360
I often hear coworkers talking about restaurants.

547
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,550
Do you need a recommendation?

548
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,100
Okay.

549
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,250
Telling the CEO about everything we love to eat?

550
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,610
Is she taking our track record to increase her numbers?

551
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,650
Not only that, but she also indirectly made us look bad.

552
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,950
What?

553
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,080
She often hears us talking about restaurants.

554
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,890
Isn't she just tattling on us, saying that we don't work and only think about eating?

555
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,290
Isn't she tattling on us, saying that we don't invite her?

556
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,710
She's really poisonous.

557
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,590
That's right. She's really poisonous.

558
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,550
Glow!

559
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,530
Glow for me!

560
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,540
Despicable. This is basically the love story about two fireflies.

561
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:33,500
It's really miserable for someone like me who doesn't glow.

562
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:01,180
I've been the secretary and housekeeper.

563
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,160
Someone who doesn't like you just won't like you.

564
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,370
Even if you've read over a thousand novels,

565
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,320
theory is just different from reality.

566
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,520
You don't say hi to me when you come in?

567
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,950
That's it?

568
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,210
Follow me.

569
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,420
Hi, what a coincidence. You're here for a cup of coffee too?

570
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,950
Hi, what a coincidence. You're here for a cup of coffee too?

571
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,100
That's right!

572
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:56,000
You won't say hi to your colleague or even do anything superficial.

573
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,770
What? Do you hate me?

574
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,730
No, no!

575
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,640
If you're not enemies, you can say anything.

576
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,600
Did you eat? How's the weather? Anything like that is fine.

577
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,690
Then you'd have a good working relationship.

578
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:15,010
I especially envy you at times like these.

579
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,950
Envy me?

580
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,610
You must be mistaken.

581
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:26,410
Really. I want to be friends with everyone.

582
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,600
I don't know why, but I often make matters worse.

583
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,090
Indeed, there's always a way out.

584
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,170
If our little cutie learns how to be independent,

585
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,320
will she still need the overbearing CEO to always rescue her?

586
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,470
Do you have time right now?

587
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,410
What do you want to do?

588
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,290
I want to pull the carpet from under you.

589
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,640
I'm going to make you into an independent woman who doesn't need a man.

Aoran, what's wrong?

605
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,250
Security just notified me that Xiao'en forced Chuchu to go into an empty conference room.

606
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,810
You're still suspicious of Xiao'en?

607
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,000
That's enough. I was wrong to trust you.

608
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,560
Because of what you said, I almost believed that Zheng Xiao'en was harmless.

609
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,160
Now that I think about it, whatever she said about liking me

610
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,380
was just to cover up her ill will towards Chuchu that I found out about.

611
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,770
Just wait. You'll see with your own eyes how

she exposes her true colors on her first day back at work.

Let me ask you. Why didn't you eat lunch with us just now?

615
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:56,040
I... I still had work to do.

616
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,740
Ding ding.

617
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,310
You think I didn't see that awful lunch of yours that day?

618
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,540
I know you don't eat with us because of your family situation.

619
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,150
But because you turn us down every time,

620
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,250
of course your co-workers will think that you're difficult to work with.

621
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:20,710
But is there a more tactful way to say no?

622
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,430
You don't have to say no.

623
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,580
Just take your lunch and slay them.

624
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,950
When everyone sees your simple lunch,

625
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,640
they will think it's very strange.

626
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,590
Chuchu, our office salary

627
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:42,580
can't possibly be so bad that your lunch is so awful.

628

I wanted to try it.

633
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,810
Wow. Could it be that Chuchu is that skinny because she eats like this?

634
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:06,430
So many people like her. Is it because of her lunch?

635
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:10,010
My God, I want to eat the exact same thing as her.

636
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,980
Xiao'en, you're really impressive.

637
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,890
The workplace is like this.

638
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,930
Ignorantly catering to others will tire yourself out.

639
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:24,250
Ignorantly being yourself will tire others out.

640
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:28,380
Being a person and doing work is the same. You have to have skill.

641
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,180
What kind of skill?

642
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,920
Let me give you an example. It's time to get off work.

643
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,970
Not a single person has left the office.

644
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,190
What do you do?

645
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,370
I sneak out quietly?

646
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,710
Don't even think about leaving!

647
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:48,080
Cancel all of your evening plans.

648
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,700
If the director sees that you want to leave and smiles as she says

649
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,340
"Don't worry. You can go first."

650
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,270
Good thing the director understands me.

651
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,910
Naive! The answer is the same as before.

652
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,880
Cancel all of your evening plans.

653
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,440
But what if I have something very important?

654
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,380
If it is so important that you have to leave,

655
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,040
take out your handkerchief, put a drop of red ink, cover your mouth with it...

656
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,670
and cough with all your might that everyone in the office can hear you.

657
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:21,820
I promise you that they'll ask you to leave and go see the doctor immediately.

658
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,010
That's going overboard, isn't it?

659
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,520
Some rules of a group are unreasonable.

660
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,550
But in order to survive, you must at least have a basic understanding.

661
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:40,010
Otherwise, one day you'll become the target.

662
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,330
You won't even know how you died.

663
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,310
CEO.

664
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,430
Zheng Xiao'en's true colors.

665
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,610
Don't think that I'll believe her so easily.

666
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,520
Okay, okay, keep monitoring her.

667
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,490
Did you hear that?

668
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,780
Tell me whenever something happens.

669
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,180
Okay.

670
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:20,440
Chuchu, can you help me with these report forms?

671
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,980
Sure, no problem.

672
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:29,150
There just so happens to be something I need your help with.

673
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,910
Could you help me write a proposal?

674
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:33,100
It just has to include this stack of data.

675
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,280
Sister Susan wants it soon.

676
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,840
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

677
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,380
Sister Qiutian, you've worked hard.

678
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:53,020
Tourism, retail spending,

679
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:56,200
transportation, bed & breakfasts,

680
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,270
and other recreational activities have been majorly impacted by the pandemic.

681
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,970
Many companies have shut down their business.

682
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,750
This is the time when funds are most tight.

683
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:10,010
And also the opportunity for us, the marketing department, to perform well.

684
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,880
What should we eat later?

685
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,380
I want to eat a hamburger today.

686
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,930
If there's anything you need, just ask me, got it?

687
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,530
Yes, I got it.

688
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:44,310
Then, do you want your pour-over coffee with sugar and cream tomorrow?

689
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,680
No, is it the one you brewed for Susan last time?

690
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,700
- Yes!
- Fine, I'll give it a try then.

691
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,970
Didn't you ask the security guard to continue monitoring her?

692
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,690
It's just monitoring. Why does it need to be reported to me?

693
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,370
Then, I'll take my leave now, CEO.

694
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:03,990
Wait.

695
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,950
Since you already brought it up, just leave it there.

696
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,180
What?

697
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,960
I'm looking at Zheng Xiao'en's true colors.

698
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:15,080
♫ Lost to you ♫

699
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:25,470
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

700
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:28,770
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

701
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:34,910
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

702
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:41,360
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

703
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,930
Hey! Is anyone in there?

704
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:14,950
My stomach really hurts! Hurry up and come out!

705
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:18,420
- Xiao'en?
- Sorry, I can't hold it anymore.

706
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:33,810
Zheng Xiao'en, what exactly are you doing?

707
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,870
Do you think we haven't noticed that you've gotten really close to Chuchu these past few days?

708
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,910
I'm not afraid to tell you guys the truth.

709
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:42,330
I've been bonding with her recently.

710
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,110
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

711
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,470
No, let me ask you this.

712
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:48,800
Do you guys really want to marry the CEO?

713
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,450
I just need some eye candy to satisfy my cravings.

714
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,140
How can people like us desecrate the CEO?

715
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,440
Let me ask you another question.

716
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,820
Do you guys like to see a happy CEO or an unhappy CEO?

717
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,780
Of course, a happy CEO!

718
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,800
If you don't want the CEO to be unhappy,

719
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,230
then don't mess with his little baby.

720
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:08,770
Don't mess with her? Then what can we do?

721
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:09,920
Become friends with her!

722
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,440
- Huh?
- Why?

723
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,110
If you can't beat her, just join her. Don't you know that?

724
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:17,330
To be able to make the CEO view her in a different light,

725
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,570
she must have an advantage that we don't have.

726
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:23,880
We must study her good qualities and increase our combat effectiveness.

727
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,210
That's right. Learn it and surpass her!

728
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:28,350
The student will become superior to the master.

729
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,070
When we see the CEO in the future, we won't just feast our eyes...

730
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,840
We can also caress his hair.

731
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,890
Touch his pecs.

732
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:37,980
Touch his fingernails.

733
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:43,050
You guys are too cute!

734
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:46,140
- Did you learn?
- We learned.

735
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,320
As long as you know!

736
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,730
Have you seen enough?

737
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:08,420
Not enough. Is there a copy of these pictures?

738
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,690
What do you mean?

739
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:13,070
I want to have it as a keepsake.

740
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,080
Hey, what do you mean?

741
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:34,180
So that's what you eat to become so pretty.

742
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,080
Then, I'll make my own lunch starting tomorrow.

743
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,410
Nonsense. It would be weird if you weren't skinny from eating such bland food.

744
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:43,540
But that's how losing weight is. There needs to be a first step.

745
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,060
A light packed lunch is a start.

746
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,940
My stomach has really started to become skinnier.

747
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,130
Also, I saw on the Internet that this diet brings good fortune.

748
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:55,560
- Doesn't it help you get a man?
- That also.

749
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,030
Then, I want to eat more.

750
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,040
Chuchu, do you want to eat with us tomorrow?

751
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,940
Sure!

752
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,240
Chuchu looks brighter now. She's smiling more.

753
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,290
She's getting along well with her colleagues.

754
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:15,010
Zheng Xiao'en gave it her all to establish harmony within the office.

755
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,740
What's wrong?

756
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,810
So... it's Zheng Xiao'en?

757
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:26,430
What?

758
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:29,020
She's the one you wanted as a keepsake?

759
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,960
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

760
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,430
Hey, Qingfeng!

761
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:55,860
Xiao'en.

762
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,900
What is this?

763
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,020
Open it and take a look.

764
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:16,080
[Dear Xiao'en, thank you. - Chuchu]

765
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,120
Thank you for your help.

766
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,550
Things have been a lot better at work lately.

767
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:22,960
I have more confidence in myself now.

768
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,470
I feel that I can do more than I used to now.

769
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,510
I knew you could do it.

770
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,130
Women like us have to strive for independence.

771
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:37,200
We absolutely cannot think of relying on men.

772
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:43,230
No, what I meant to say is... do well.

773
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,660
By relying on ourselves, we can also make it big.

774
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,100
Yes.

775
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:58,640
These are complimentary tickets I won.

776
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,590
There's no need. You already gave me this.

777
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:06,040
Also, the reason I helped you wasn't that innocent.

778
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:10,240
Do you think that if I mustered the courage to ask the CEO out,

779
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,090
he would agree to go with me?

780
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,650
No, didn't we agree that women need to strive for independence?

781
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:23,300
Because of your support, I feel that women can take the initiative too.

782
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:28,020
If not for you, I definitely wouldn't have the courage to take this step.

783
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:33,920
My bus is here! I'm leaving now!

784
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,240
Xiao'en, thank you!

785
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,660
Let's see how I do tomorrow. Bye!

786
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,470
I don't want to stay here anymore.

787
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:12,120
If I die in this world, can I return to my original world?

788
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,140
What about Zheng Xiao'en? Are you better now?

789
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,680
The CEO seems to be very worried about you.

790
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,530
He keeps asking me if you're sick.

791
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,500
That's enough. Stop tormenting yourself.

792
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,700
The lively Zheng Xiao'en who makes noise, stirs up trouble, and glares at people

793
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:28,100
must continue to make noise and stir up trouble like she does now.

794
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,200
You're not allowed to cry anymore, okay?

795
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,570
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

796
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:49,590
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

797
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:55,160
♫ A quiet strike ♫

798
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,340
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

799
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,590
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

800
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:03,730
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

801
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:08,140
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

802
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:12,710
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

803
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:15,920
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

804
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,990
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

805
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:25,590
♫ If I could see you again ♫

806
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:32,360
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

807
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,420
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

808
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:45,680
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

809
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,450
♫ If you were a painter ♫

810
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,380
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

811
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,750
♫ No regrets ♫

812
01:10:55,750 --> 01:11:01,490
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
