You already knew that she liked me.

So you sent her to my house to help her?

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,680
Aoran, you don't have to accept her feelings,

but don't question her sincerity.

Maybe you've misunderstood Zheng Xiao'en from the beginning.

Thank you for taking care of me during this time.

I don't want to be in this world anymore.

I want to return to the real world!

99
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,450
I'll surely die if I jump from here, right?

100
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,220
If I die in this world,

101
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,480
can I return to my original world?

How would I know if I don't test it out?

No. I'm afraid of heights.

106

I'll try a different method.

107
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,160
Jumping from a building is not scientific after all.

108
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,850
Never mind whether it'll work or not,

109
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,930
but jumping like that would break me into at least ten pieces.

110
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,560
It'd be great if I really do return to the real world,

111
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,430
but I might be missing an arm, a leg, or something else!

112
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,960
It's scary just to think about it.

113
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,020
How did I get here in the first place?

114
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:12,020
Forty degrees Celsius. I finally have a fever.
(104 degrees Fahrenheit)

But does that mean I'll never see Situ Aoran again?

118
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,730
Don't see him. Don't see him. This old woman does not care.

119
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,270
I'm just a narrow-minded person who doesn't like seeing others happy.

120
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,190
I will never wish you well.

121

You didn't answer the phone at all last night.

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,250
I was worried, so I decided to stop by.

Oh right, Qiutian just left for work.

Don't scare me. Zheng Xiao'en.

Someone needs to guard the top!

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,950
I don't know what's wrong with your sister lately.

143
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,020
I went to talk to her many times.

144
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,130
I've tried crying, whining,

145
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,920
and all other possible methods.

146
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,300
But it's no use.

147
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,570
Darling, it must be hard on you.

148
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,860
Mom, don't talk to Sister about those things.

149
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,990
You're just adding fuel to the fire. She'll stay mad even longer.

150
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,750
I just don't know what she's mad about.

151
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,310
You did really well in response to the strike.

152
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,770
Did you know? Everywhere I go, there are people praising you.

153
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,320
I'm so proud of you.

154

Really?

155
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,290
Really.

156
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,200
Before, when people brought up Tianliang Group,

157
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,020
they only discussed about that brat.

158
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,780
Now they know there's also a He Tianjian.

159
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,240
My darling just didn't want to do it.

160
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,300
As long as he wants to do it, he can do anything well.

161
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,970
You really think that?

162
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,940
Of course!

163
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,880
Department Head, you have a guest.

164
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,550
Mom, it's so weird. I actually have a guest at this old place.

165
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,160
I'll go see what's going on.

166
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,400
Okay, bye.

167
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,040
I never would have thought that the chairwoman would...

168
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,460
I never would've thought either.

169
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,100
I also don't know why she's suddenly gone crazy.

170
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,050
I can't believe she was able to find this old factory in Tianliang Group.

171
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,410
She's nervous about you.

172
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,720
Is she?

173
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,370
Because you undermined her.

174
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,270
Do you know why Qin Hui chased Yue Fei to death?

175
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,860
And why Song Gaozong issued twelve golden plaques to murder Yue Fei?

176
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,190
It's because he was afraid Yue Fei would defeat the Jin people.

177
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,430
It's a classic case of doing so well that your boss is insecure.

178
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,510
The more successful Yue Fei was, the more incompetent Song Gaozong appeared.

179
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,970
I'm actually more concerned about the chairwoman's current condition.

180
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,270
She might've been suppressed for too long because of Tianxing,

181
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,110
so her mental condition might not be the best.

182
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,360
If she continues like this and is unable to control herself,

183
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,970
it'll be bad for the company and herself.

What's the point of you being gone?

189
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,500
I originally thought that without you,

190
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,990
Tianliang would be mine.

191
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,610
As it turns out, after you were gone,

192
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,260
other monsters and demons have appeared.

193
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,030
I just realized

194
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,020
that you can't die.

For the first time I realized that

my life's greatest purpose as He Mingli

201

Why did we come to fish?

It's because I'm afraid you'll overthink things at home.

206
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,310
Isn't this the romance novel world?

207
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,730
Why did we not take a private jet to see the northern lights in Iceland?

208
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,750
Or go on a vacation at Nanyang Island?

209
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,620
Reserving an entire department store and going on a shopping spree would be nice too,

210

about what the CEO and Chuchu are doing.

I can see it.

They're happily meeting at the entrance of the amusement park.

He'll show her a smile that he never shows anyone else.

222
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,310
Chuchu cheerfully tells him,

"This is the lunch I made today."

You're not curious about what they're doing?

228
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,650
I'm more curious about

whether you really want to go to Iceland and Nanyang Island.

230

They must've already entered the amusement park.

They must be doing various exciting activities.

232

These types of activities are the best at igniting the sparks of love.

233
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,190
Or they're going to the haunted house together.

234

CEO may be afraid of the dark, but for Chuchu,

235

he'll bravely move forward.

325
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,070
Anyhow, they're all negative emotions.

326
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,670
Reasonable.

327
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,160
I did feel a bit disappointed.

328
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,620
But now that it's certain she's not coming,

329
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,090
I actually felt

330
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,960
a bit relieved.

331
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
Is this also reasonable?

332
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,740
No, this isn't reasonable.

333
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,310
This is the strange feeling that I can't describe.

334
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,110
How can this be?

335
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,720
Let's get to the root of the problem.

336
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,430
You were looking forward to today's date because you like Chuchu.

337
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,560
So why do you like Chuchu?

338
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,150
Because she's caring, warm, kind, considerate, elegant, and courteous.

339
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,360
She's always thinking of others.

340
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,960
I was asking you why you like Chuchu.

341
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,320
Because she's caring, warm, kind, considerate, elegant, and thoughtful.

342
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,010
Also, she's always thinking of others.

343
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,580
Okay, enough.

344
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,330
The reason isn't important.

345
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:18,480
Since the author wants you to have a crush on her, you do.

346
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,550
Why are you asking?

347
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,560
Is my reason for liking Chuchu important?

348
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,980
The reason isn't important.

349
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,020
Since the author wants you to like her, you do.

350
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,930
What? I don't understand what you just said.

351
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,270
I couldn't understand it back then either, but I do now.

352
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,280
What do you mean?

353
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,380
[Critical Care Center]

354
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,890
Thankfully, you're okay.

355
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,270
You're really going to scare me to death!

356
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,350
When I went to light the prayer lantern, I also took the opportunity to shoujing.

357
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,190
(Shoujing: a Taoist ritual to reclaim a frightened soul)

358
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,060
Doctor, I really hope there isn't a day when I see my picture on Breaking News Commune (Facebook group for Taiwanese news).

359
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,320
But what's with your hospital?

360
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,940
Why does Xiao'en keep getting hurt?

361
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,560
We've looked at the surveillance camera footage.

362
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,310
Aside from the nurse, no one else came into the room before the patient was injured.

363
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,460
So...

364
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,540
So we can only speculate that the patient bled on her own.

365
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,350
Oh, so you're saying that she was lying around and then just started bleeding?

366
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,890
Does that sound reasonable?

367
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,680
I know this sounds unreasonable,

368
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,460
but currently we can't find any other reasons.

369
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,740
So Xiao'en can get hurt at any moment?

370
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,380
Forget about those previous cuts and grazes.

371
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,140
Her head was bleeding this time. This is no joke!

372
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,480
I'm very sorry. We will perform a deeper examination

373
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,400
for any other medical conditions that we haven't identified.

374
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,290
Xiao'en, what exactly happened?

375
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,220
Stop being Sleeping Beauty.

376
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,300
Did you dream of something good?

377
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,120
Why won't you wake up?

378
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,860
Please get well soon.

379
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,720
Let's go home, alright?

380
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,830
This is my home. Welcome.

381
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,030
Sorry for the disturbance.

382
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,780
Sorry.

383
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,690
Do you still feel dizzy?

384
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,530
It's nothing. I'll be fine after some rest.

385
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,020
Treat this place like your home.

386
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,360
Isn't this too much trouble for you?

387
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,630
Is there anyone else you can trouble?

388
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,380
That's right! Just go ahead and trouble me.

389
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
You guys can't go home right now anyway.

390
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,370
The loan sharks will show up to kidnap you at any time.

391
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,480
When that happens, paying ransom for you is the real trouble!

392
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,910
Alright, just stay at my home and hide well.

393
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:07,080
But I'm sorry, your brother will need to sleep on the sofa.

394
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,270
No, not at all.

395
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,120
I'm already very grateful for your willingness to take the two of us in.

396
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,090
Thank you, Sister Xiao'en.

397
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,090
Okay. The problem of finding a place to stay is solved.

398
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,940
What about your dad's medical fees?

399
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,300
I don't know. All my relatives hang up on me when they hear that I want to borrow money.

400
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,970
You stood up the CEO because your dad suddenly needed surgery.

401
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,680
Why didn't you think to just borrow from the CEO?

402
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,400
Money is what an overbearing CEO has the most of.

403
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,060
I don't want the CEO to know that my dad is ill.

404
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,400
Why?

405
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,870
I don't want my family issues to become the CEO's burden.

406
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,700
Great!

407
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,260
Women need to have backbone.

408
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,170
So I'll take care of your dad's medical fees.

409
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,450
We can't let you do that!

410
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,190
Your dad's medical fees.

411
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,240
- But—
- No buts.

412
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,110
Do you want your little brother to drop out of school to work instead?

413
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,310
- I'm OK with that.
- You'll be KO'd first. (Knockout)

414
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,550
I can find a second job.

415
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,810
Aren't you afraid of being followed by the loan sharks?

416
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,270
That's great. The colleagues in attendance have reached a consensus.

417
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,620
Don't worry, I'll take care of the rest of the fees.

418
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,880
What?

419
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,120
Can't I accrue some good deeds?

420
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,030
Don't cry.

421
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,200
This is a loan. You have to pay me back in the future.

422
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,060
I'm not that nice.

423
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,010
I will pay you back. I absolutely won't evade my debt.

424
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,740
Xiao'en, I really don't know how to repay you.

425
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,730
When I am able to, I'll definitely thank you properly.

426
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,810
I promise.

427
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,870
Okay, you said it: you will rely on your abilities.

428
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,580
- I will rely on my own abilities.
- Don't rely on men.

429
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,920
I won't rely on... men?

430
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,350
Thank you, Sister Xiao'en.

431
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,630
I will also thank you properly in the future.

432
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,210
You, just study hard.

433
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,890
When you start working, remember to treat your older sister well.

434
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:23,010
She suffered a lot because of you and your father. Understand?

435
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,560
I know.

436
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,710
Wait. Has my heart gone soft toward my love rival?

437
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,400
Xiao'en, you're such a good friend.

438
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,930
If you need help one day, you must remember to tell me

439
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,730
so that I'll have the chance to help you too.

440
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,660
What? Chuchu didn't go because she was sick?

441
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,960
Is she okay?

442
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,820
A type of infectious pneumonia?

443
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,130
Pneumonia?

444
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,860
Is it severe?

445
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,640
Does she have a fever?

446
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,340
What is her blood oxygen level?

447
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,950
Did she go to the hospital to get it looked at?

448
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,250
When she's recovered, she'll contact Aoran herself?

449
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,440
Okay, I'll tell him.

450
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Take care.

451
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,460
Wait.

452
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,710
If it's infectious,

453
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,060
doesn't Zheng Xiao'en also have to be more careful?

454
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,590
♫ Lost to you ♫

455
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:56,430
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

456
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,640
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

457
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,840
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

458
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,700
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

459
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,140
A type of infectious pneumonia?

460
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,820
Pneumonia?

461
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,620
Is it severe?

462
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,050
Does she have a fever?

463
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,750
What is her blood oxygen level?

464
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,450
Did she go to the hospital to get it looked at?

465
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,670
When she's recovered, she'll contact Aoran herself?

466
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,860
Okay, I'll let him know.

467
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,040
Take care.

468
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,790
Wait.

469
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,340
If it's infectious,

470
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,330
doesn't Zheng Xiao'en also have to be more careful?

471
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,560
That's right. How could I forget something so important?

472
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,740
Do you want to remind her yourself?

473
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,030
That's not necessary. I just casually brought it up.

474
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,900
Oh, right. I'm just casually bringing this up.

475
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,340
Since this pneumonia is infectious,

476
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,800
then you should be more careful, okay?

477
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,010
Don't be perfunctory.

478
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,980
Okay, stay in contact.

479
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,140
Stay in contact?

480
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,220
What's wrong?

481
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,460
So you and Zheng Xiao'en are in contact a lot?

482
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,990
Before, I was in charge of her.

483
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,750
Suddenly I really miss when the three of us worked together.

484
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,710
Do you not miss it?

485
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,670
What is there to miss?

486
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,780
Work is work.

487
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:02,040
But after work, you still worry about whether Zheng Xiao'en will also be infected.

488
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,430
I'm afraid that she'll spread it to her coworkers.

489
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,040
Don't forget. The company has central air conditioning.

490
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,130
Oh, so you're a CEO who cares about his entry-level employees.

491
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,700
Do you care that much about me?

492
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,560
You're not even an-entry level employee.

493
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,850
Why are you seeking attention?

494
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,420
I'm not seeking attention.

495
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,990
I'm just a little surprised.

496
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:30,710
What is so surprising about a boss caring for his employees?

497
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,090
That's right.

498
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,900
The U.S. president hates posting on Twitter the most,

499
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,030
and North Korea's test missiles are the most accurate.

500
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,130
What's that?

501
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,920
I don't know. I learned it from Zheng Xiao'en.

502
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,870
Why does it sound like you're scolding me?

503
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,410
Then what you think isn't wrong.

504
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,300
Impulsivity leads to messing things up.

505
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,170
Why did I puff myself up?

506
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,050
I can't believe I told Chuchu that I'd cover her debt.

507
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,330
"Money is not a problem."

508
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,150
The problem is that I don't have money.

509
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,580
Am I crazy?

510
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,570
Where am I going to find money?

511
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:11,750
The most brainless way would be to go ask Duanmu Qingfeng to borrow money.

512
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,020
No, that won't do. This would mean I have no backbone at all.

513
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:19,820
Also, what's the difference between letting Qingfeng know and just telling Situ Aoran directly?

514
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,530
That won't work. I can't give him the chance to be the hero who saves the damsel-in-distress.

515
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:32,390
It looks like the only way is for me to be the hero.

516
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,120
Playing a madwoman with my appearance

517
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,920
is such a waste.

518
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,290
I never thought in my lifetime that I would have to take the plunge.

519
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,560
Not to mention, it's in a novel and also for my love rival.

520
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,060
Isn't this too much of a sacrifice?

521
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:04,010
It doesn't matter. My pseudonym will be Chuchu.

522
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,970
The romance novel world doesn't have hostess clubs?

523
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:14,760
Since I can't sacrifice my beauty, then I can only sacrifice my body.

524
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,330
There's no construction sites?

525
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,000
Are all the big buildings 3D printed?

526
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:30,080
I never thought that finding a part-time job would be this hard.

527
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,030
No way.

528
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,350
How much longer will it take?

529
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:03,040
- We're almost there.
- You said that half an hour ago.

530
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,580
[No. 19, Lane 193, Zhucun Road, Taiping District, Taichung City]

531
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,620
Where are they?

532
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,160
Is anyone there?

533
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,590
Is anyone there? Please open the door!

534
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:34,640
Yoohoo, hey! Open the door! Stop sleeping!

535
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,530
Why are you being noisy? Nobody lives there.

536
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,680
So noisy.

537
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,640
So they moved away?

538
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,550
That's right. Can you not tell?

539
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,860
Hey, wait. Do you have a way to contact them?

540
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,440
No, I don't.

541
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,050
Open the door.

542
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,920
Open the door!

543
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,190
Go to the neighbor and ask about what's going on.

544
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,040
Yes.

545
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,780
What is going on?

546
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,480
One came earlier, and now two are here.

547
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,220
Someone came earlier? What do you mean?

548
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,710
Earlier, a young man was knocking on the door and left after I yelled at him.

549
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,730
Now it's you guys.

550
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,420
What did that young man look like?

551
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,000
Tall with blonde hair. How annoying.

552
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:20,830
He Tianjian, come out.

553
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,120
I know you're also here.

554
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,400
It's no use hiding.

555
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,180
My patience has a limit.

556
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,960
Come out right now!

557
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,040
It looks like he really did leave.

558
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,880
He ran away quite fast.

559
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,970
Let's go.

560
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,360
You're back.

561
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,220
Sis! You had time to visit?

562
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,980
I came to see if my little brother is used to this new job.

563
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,630
Of course I'm not used to it!

564
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,550
What? Can I go back to Taipei?

565
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,420
What do you think?

566
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,160
Young people should train more.

567
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,960
I'm doing this for your own good.

568
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,580
Where did you go just now?

569
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,980
There probably isn't much business to do here.

570
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,790
I walked around to get used to the new environment.

571
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:55,190
After all, it's possible I might be here for a while.

572
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,670
Okay.

573
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,560
Don't lie anymore.

574
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,690
You can fool others but you can't fool me.

575
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,390
You went to find Lawyer Wei, right?

576
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,130
Where's the will?

577
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,520
I didn't find it.

578
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,570
I know you won't believe me.

579
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:22,070
But whether you believe me or not, the will isn't here with me.

580
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:28,350
He Tianjian, did you decide to fight alone?

581
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,720
What?

582
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,850
You don't like the frozen shrimps here?

583
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,570
Do you want me to send you to an outer island to fish some fresh ones?

584
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,790
Don't force me!

585
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,540
Wait. Sis—

586
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,940
I'm discussing business with you right now. Call me Chairwoman.

587
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:50,850
I don't care what we're discussing! Can you not use that tone when you're talking to me?

588
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,460
Sure.

589
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,970
Give me the will and we can discuss anything.

590
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,140
I already said that the will isn't here with me.

591
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,060
Then there isn't anything to discuss.

592
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,180
Does it really need to be like this?

593
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,680
Aren't we family?

594
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,340
Don't try to hold me back with familial affection.

595
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,830
When you found out about Lawyer Wei's whereabouts,

596
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,070
did you think about notifying me?

597
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,600
Did you think about me as your sister?

598
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,860
You betrayed me first!

599
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,020
I betrayed you?

600
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,880
Okay. Then let me ask you.

601
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,340
Why am I standing here today?

602
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,420
Did you not kick me out first?

603
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,450
I also wanted to help you with the strike.

604
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,020
In the end, what did I gain?

605
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,490
I was sent to this weird deserted place.

606
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,400
If you were me, how would you feel?

607
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,950
Don't put it so nicely.

608
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:58,240
Do you think I don't know what you're really thinking?

609
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,690
Sis, you've really changed.

610
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:14,410
No matter who it is, whoever sits in my position today

611
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:17,380
would have to make sacrifices and changes.

612
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,420
I knew it.

613
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,970
Even if he can hide really well,

614
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,920
there's no way he wouldn't contact his wife or children.

615
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,920
He Mingli, don't go that far.

616
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,830
Lawyer Wei's wife and children are innocent.

617
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,400
You're even touching his family members.

618
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,670
Isn't that going overboard?

619
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,460
I've already sacrificed my family.

620
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,590
How come his family can stay out of it?

621
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:02,020
Do you know how scary you are right now?

622
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,940
If you have nothing to be guilty of,

623
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,670
what is there to be scared of?

624
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,640
♫ Lost to you ♫

625
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:40,480
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

626
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,830
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

627
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:49,930
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

628
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:56,410
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

629
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,010
I knew it.

630
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,680
Even if he can hide really well,

631
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,550
there's no way he wouldn't contact his wife or children.

632
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:11,650
He Mingli, don't go that far.

633
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,440
Lawyer Wei's wife and children are innocent.

634
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,060
You're even touching his family members.

635
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,050
Isn't that going overboard?

636
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,040
I've already sacrificed my family.

637
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,110
How come his family can stay out of it?

638
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:35,000
Do you know how scary you are right now?

639
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,600
If you have nothing to be guilty of,

640
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,500
what is there to be scared of?

641
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:30,070
That's good. You've finally thought it through.

642
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,320
Uncle Hu is on your side.

643
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,550
We'll figure it out, okay?

644
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,750
Bye.

645
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,000
- We're off work.
- Let's go shopping.

646
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,750
A new outlet opened next to the company. It'll be easier to shop now!

647
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,460
It's fake. It was 3D printed.

648
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,020
What's with her?

649
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,280
Are you coming? Just one word.

650
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:20,070
No. Busy. Leaving now. Bye.

651
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,400
Chuchu, are you busy after work?

652
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,410
Sorry, I have some family things to take care of. Have fun.

653
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,790
What's going on?

654
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,150
Thank you.

655
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,120
Are you feeling better?

656
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,400
You're referring to...

657
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,990
Zheng Xiao'en said you got pneumonia.

658
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,490
I'm almost fully recovered.

659
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,480
That fast?

660
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,020
Fortunately it was discovered early.

661
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,610
That's good.

662
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,120
I'm sorry. I didn't show up that day

663
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,590
even though I was the one who asked you out.

664
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,520
It's okay.

665
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,380
You didn't want to not show up. Health comes first.

666
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,460
Thanks, CEO.

667
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:44,390
Then, is everything else okay?

668
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,820
Everything else?

669
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,000
Didn't they say the pneumonia is infectious?

670
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:55,970
Your... coworkers are okay, right?

671
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:00,220
Are you referring to Xiao'en?

672
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,010
Yes.

673
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,000
She's great.

674
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,390
That's good.

675
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:18,160
I was afraid that if she got sick, it would spread to other coworkers.

676
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,550
CEO, please don't worry. Xiao'en is very healthy.

677
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,950
Okay. Let's go then.

678
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:46,360
Welcome.

679
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,650
Welcome home, Master! Meow!

680
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,000
Master, this way, please.

681
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:02,370
Meow, meow.

682
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,050
What would you like to eat today?

683
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:13,560
Master, what would you like to eat today?

684
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:20,290
Meow, meow, meow. Meow! Meow! Meow!

685
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:23,360
I apologize, this maid is new here.

686
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,960
Please forgive us, Master. I will send you a well-behaved maid right away.

687
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,830
I apologize, Master. Is there anything you would like to eat today?

688
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,210
I can give you an overview, Master.

689
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,740
I know it's your first day at work today

690
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,430
and you still have a lot to learn,

691
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,910
but treating your master with courtesy is fundamental.

692
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:46,390
Were you trying to scare the customer away?

693
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,110
I'm sorry. I will familiarize myself with the store's rules as quickly as possible.

694
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:57,010
Remember, every customer is your master.

695
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,950
Meow.

696
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,330
With such a G-rated part-time job, when am I going to earn any money?

697
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:12,680
Why doesn't the romance novel world have R-rated (18 and older) jobs?

698
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,930
Welcome home, Master!

699
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,310
♫ Lost to you ♫

700
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:32,560
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

701
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,900
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

702
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:42,000
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

703
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,580
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

704
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:58,660
I didn't expect that you would actually like coming to maid cafés.

705
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,880
Wow.

706
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,640
Hey, what's that look on your face?

707
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,000
I followed you here, alright?

708
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,870
Huh?

709
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,230
Where is she rushing to?

710
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,020
Zheng Xiao'en!

711
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:48,030
[No riding without a mask]

712
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,480
That's what happened.

713
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,970
Oh, so you're a stalker who hides your true nature from those who know you.

714
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,950
I was showing my concern for you.

715
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,670
You came to watch a good show, didn't you?

716
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,930
Why are you working a part-time job?

717
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,280
I'm short on money.

718
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,700
Could it be that you think I have special interests?

719
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:13,950
Meow!

720
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,760
Master, may I ask what's so funny? Meow.

721
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,560
Nothing.

722
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,930
I'm just surprised that you came to work here.

723
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:33,520
I was a thousand times reluctant, okay? Meow.

724
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:39,010
Then, did you know that Royal Group prohibits working a part-time job?

725
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,960
I didn't know that.

726
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:48,630
Meow. Then, you can't be a snitch (Taiwanese slang).

727
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,960
What is that?

728
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,130
A big mouth.

729
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:55,210
Did you forget to say something?

730
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,000
Meow.

731
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,680
Not bad. You have wisdom.

732
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:07,140
Fine. If you perform to my satisfaction today,

733
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,160
I'll keep your secret.

734
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:16,970
Then, Master, have you decided what you'll eat today? Meow.

735
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,720
Are there any dishes you recommend?

736
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,290
I recommend the kind that you can eat quickly to get out of here as soon as possible. Meow.

737
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:27,660
But I'm used to taking my time eating.

738
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:35,030
If you would like to eat until the Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day) of next year, that's fine too, Master. Meow.

739
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:39,980
Okay, then I'll have the chef's set meal.

740
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,980
I'll prepare that for you right away, Master. Meow.

741
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,900
Master, this is your meal.

742
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,250
Pink kisses, pretty maid, sweet to the heart. Chef's special.

743
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,500
Please enjoy. Meow.

744
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,530
So you guys don't have a spoon-feeding service?

745
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,720
Master, I would like to kindly remind you that

746
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,640
this is the maid's course, not the handicap's course.

747
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,000
Please make use of your two hands. Meow.

748
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:34,120
Truly a shame. I'll start eating then.

749
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,400
Please enjoy. Meow.

750
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:42,230
Oh, right. Why are you short on money?

751
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,040
I... I want to buy a luxury bag.

752
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,830
I've never seen you carry a luxury bag.

753
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:58,210
It's because I don't have one that I want to carry it.

754
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,120
Meow!

755
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:06,250
Are you doing this on purpose? Meow.

756
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,040
Yes.

757
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,210
No matter how you put it, we're allies.

758
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:12,990
Why are you here to watch me embarrass myself? Meow.

759
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,460
Who said I'm watching you embarrass yourself?

760
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,690
If not, then what? Meow.

761
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:23,190
Can't I watch you be cute?

762
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,680
How am I cute? Meow?

763
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:34,270
Here, here, here, and here.

764
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,340
Are you ridiculing me?

765
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:43,980
No, I really think you're cute.

766
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,970
Even without the meows or the maid outfit, you're still cute.

767
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,830
Someone named Xiao'en fainted right in front of me.

768
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,970
Zheng Xiao'en, why are you being such a busybody?

769
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:22,170
Since something like this happened, why didn't you come to me?

770
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,940
You make me feel like this world is especially full of warmth.

771
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,520
I'm no longer a little corporate slave in this big, big world.

772
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,920
Aoran is very concerned for Xiao'en?

773
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,070
What is their relationship like now?

774
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,730
If there's anything you still want, you can tell me.

775
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,970
You're a person who treats others with sincerity,

776
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:44,940
so I absolutely won't let you be alone in the end.
