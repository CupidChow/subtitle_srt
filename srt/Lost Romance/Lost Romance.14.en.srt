How could the woman that I, Situ Aoran, fall for be an ordinary woman?

17
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,880
To me, you're the most special one in the world.

Aoran still has dreams even now.

Then, that means He Tianxing is still unconscious.

Don't you want to know what place you have in Zheng Xiao'en's heart?

Are you willing to lose her like this?

27
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,230
I backed off because Xiao'en likes you,

not because you're my friend.

Remember, a marriage proposal isn't a fleeting moment of bliss.

It’s something touching.

This place is really not bad. Your mood will improve.

But just be sad for a while; don’t be too hard on yourself.

That’s right. Role.

And on another day, I could be Leng Ziqing.

111

From what I remember, the first time I appeared

112

In order to find her, I accidentally got on a cruise ship bound for the west.

They planned to return to their country together.

135
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,510
Right at the moment when they set foot on their cruise,

136
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,750
flames colored the entire sky red.

Everything that was before their eyes

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,190
seemed like it was burning.

This story has no ending.

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,300
When I woke up,

141
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,590
I became another person.

142
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,400
I started another story again.

143
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,840
But from the second story on,

144
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,780
I became like a bystander.

145
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,550
I couldn't do anything.

146
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,210
I also think there are no reasons behind my actions.

147
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,470
I must have come here with the thought

148
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,660
that no matter what happens between Aoran and Chuchu,

149
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,610
I want to see it for myself.

150
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,560
Then maybe I can give up.

151
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,520
It's useless for a kind guy like you to come here.

152
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,820
You're not destructive at all.

153
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,700
You can only watch helplessly and silently give them your blessings as they confirm each other's feelings.

154
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,940
At first, I didn't understand what you were saying.

155
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,230
I thought you were like me, a bystander in all the stories.

156
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,630
But as I got to know you more and interacted with you more,

157
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,280
I slowly came to understand your words.

158
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,750
I am a character in a book.

159
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,510
A character that can only be a silent guardian.

160
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,040
And because of you,

161
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,370
I realized for the first time

162
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,710
that I don't have to do what the writer planned.

163
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,930
Zheng Xiao'en, don't go to Aoran.

164
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,820
Otherwise, you'll disappear. For real.

165
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,440
What do you mean?

166
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,710
Why would I disappear?

167
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,950
Just like you said,

168
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,880
I am a character that can only watch helplessly as the main characters find their happiness.

169
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,500
I've seen it over and over again.

170
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,510
The main characters blissfully welcomed their happy ending.

171
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,390
The story is finished, and then...

172
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,000
And then?

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,690
And then they disappeared.

174
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,180
No one would know where they went.

175
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,510
Why?

176
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,610
Because I never got an ending of my own.

177
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,850
If I can never get an ending of my own,

178
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,960
why can't I be like you and fight for what I want?

179
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,710
Xiao'en, don't go to Aoran.

180
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,270
Come wander with me in a different story.

181
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,100
That way you won't disappear.

182
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,650
We can live as ourselves forever in different books.

183
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,060
What does it mean to disappear?

184
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,800
Will I vanish forever?

185
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,910
Or is it like a movie,

186
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,140
where I come out to act whenever an audience comes to watch?

187
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,860
After I reach the happy ending in the book,

188
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,780
will I die in real life?

189
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,150
Then what happens to Aoran?

190
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,520
What will happen to He Tianxing?

191
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,320
Always wandering around

192
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,280
from one story to another

193
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,740
is like being a lonely ghost.

194
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,580
What will happen to Qingfeng?

195
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,940
Will it take much longer?

196
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,330
Why is the director and Qiutian there too?

197
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,770
We usually meet at the house.

198
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,370
Why did he specifically ask to go out to eat?

199
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,250
He was also persistent about not changing the date.

200
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,430
If I still don't know what's happening today after seeing these clues,

201
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,080
then I wouldn't be living up to my title as romance novel queen.

202
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,290
[Just wait.]

203
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,550
The story is almost ending.

204
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,950
There's just the ceremony and the words "I love you" left.

205
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,940
Then it'll be the traditional happy ending.

206
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,660
If I go today,

207
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,080
then will it really go down like Qingfeng said?

208
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,150
Am I about to disappear?

209
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,010
Then should I still go?

210
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You have that much to talk about with Qingfeng?

211
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,200
I should've told Zheng Xiao'en that I'm proposing today.

212
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,040
But what if I told her,

213
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,770
and she still put comforting Qingfeng as her first priority?

214
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,670
Wouldn't I be so embarrassed?

215
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,010
Looks like Zheng Xiao'en also doesn't truly love you.

216
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,440
I should've added king crabs.

217
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,550
Forget it, forget it.

218
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,150
You should leave.

219
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,970
Don't move!

220
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,000
Situ Aoran.

221
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,010
Don't move.

222
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,350
Otherwise my cupid's arrow will miss its shot.

223
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,290
Are you planning to propose to me?

224
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,570
Yes.

225
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,720
Do you like me?

226
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,220
Yes.

227
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,810
No matter what, you don't want to lose me?

228
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,900
Yes, that's correct.

229
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,190
But isn't there a virtue of not plainly expressing things?

230
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,950
There's no time to cherish such virtues now.

231
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,950
Even if the conclusion is right before our eyes,

232
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,010
even if the story is ending,

233
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,780
even if we'll all disappear,

234
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:22,120
I want to walk with you till that last day comes.

235
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,960
Why are you suddenly so poetic?

236
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,480
Because...

237
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,910
If I'm going to combust,

238
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,920
I want to be a brilliant firework,

239
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,380
not an everlasting mosquito-repelling incense.

240
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,680
You're still the Zheng Xiao'en that I know.

241
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,890
Xiao'en, don't go to Aoran.

242
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,920
Come wander with me in a different story.

243
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,310
That way you won't disappear.

244
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,610
We can live as ourselves forever in different books.

245
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,750
Are you happy?

246
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,770
Is it because you want someone to accompany you,

247
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,000
or is it because of me?

248
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,780
Sorry, I can't stay and accompany you.

249
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,940
Aoran is the one I'm pursuing.

250
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,870
Even the reason that I'm here is because of him.

251
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,980
Even if I could accompany you,

252
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,990
it wouldn't change your loneliness.

253
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,010
It's because of you.

254
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,510
It's just that this answer no longer has any meaning.

255
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,660
At least I tried my best for once.

256
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,640
From now on, I'm going to do everything that I want to do.

257
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,600
Look at the moon.

258
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,820
I beg you, don't say it.

259
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,670
Then I won't say it.

260
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,390
Situ Aoran!

261
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,540
What?

262
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,460
Help me pluck the moon.

263
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,010
I don't want to.

264
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,220
Zheng Xiao'en, are you crazy?

265
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,410
Yes, I will marry you.

Complications are gradually arising from using the ECMO on Mr. He.

284
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,540
The anticoagulant drugs have also caused internal bleeding

285
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,090
which leads to sepsis.

286
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,090
A professional team has evaluated that Mr. He's body most likely won't last much longer.

287
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,760
We advise that family members make mental preparations.

288
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,000
We know Dad's condition well.

289
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,060
We should just let him leave calmly.

290
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,540
I can't bear to! I can't bear to!

291
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,990
Zhaonan.

292
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,180
My Zhaonan. I can't to.

293
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,200
Mom, let's just let go, okay?

294
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,470
Look at how much pain Dad is in!

295
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,030
Zhaonan.

296
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,140
Mr. He, I'll help you pull the tube out now.

297
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,420
You'll have neither sickness nor pain now.

298
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,910
Mingli.

299
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,740
Mingli. You have to notify Mingli.

300
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,980
If she knew...

301
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,570
Mingli... I'll notify her.

302
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,550
Right now, her condition isn't good either.

303
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,950
Let's allow her to recuperate first.

304
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,920
[Asystole]

305
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,500
Who would want to eat these things?

306
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,290
Tell He Tianjian to come and speak with me.

307
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,680
Tell him to come right now!

308
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,500
Where's my mom? She didn't come?

309
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,890
I'm asking you! Are you mute?

310
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,880
Answer me!

311
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,960
Tell my father to come.

312
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,040
Anyone is fine! I don't know you people!

313
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,430
Leave! All of you, leave!

314
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,450
What are you doing? Don't touch me!

315
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,490
I want to leave. I want to leave!

316
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,010
Let me leave!

317
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,800
Chairwoman, you have to hang in there.

318
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,850
The old chairman...

319
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,670
He passed away.

320
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,160
Here is the latest breaking news.

321
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,280
Tianliang Group's former chairman, He Zhaonan, was unable to be resuscitated

322
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,610
and has passed away at Shaoguang Hospital at the age of 70.

323
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,920
He Zhaonan started out in the construction industry when he was young

324
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,610
and built the Tianliang kingdom by himself.

325
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,720
But about half a year ago, he started having health issues.

326
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,420
That immediately caused fluctuations in Tianliang's stock prices.

327
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,690
200.

328
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,740
Charge 200. Clear.

329
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,700
I should've known not to tell Tianxing about the old chairman passing away.

330
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,080
But can the CEO hear what we say?

331
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,240
Clear.

332
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,540
[Charge to 200 J]

333
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,450
What happened?

334
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,980
You had another nightmare?

335
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,190
I don't know.

336
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,350
It's just that in my dream,

337
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,590
it seemed like something really, really sad happened.

338
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,010
So sad that I almost couldn't breathe.

339
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,510
I kind of want to drink something.

340
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,250
What do you want to drink?

341
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,350
To protect you.
(play on words: "he" means to drink, "he hu" means to protect)

342
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,380
You're acting strange today.

343
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,030
Yes, I quite like you.
(play on words: "strange" can also mean "quite")

344
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,240
I kind of want to eat noodles.

345
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,370
What kind of noodles?

346
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,460
Your...

347
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,330
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

348
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:23,380
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

349
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:29,990
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

350
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,070
You're acting strange today.

351
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,670
Yes, I quite like you.
(play on words: "strange" can also mean "quite")

352
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,930
I kind of want to eat noodles.

353
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
What kind of noodles?

354
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,120
Your...

355
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,120
Inside your heart.
(play on words: "mian" means noodles, "li mian" means inside)

356
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,560
Get out.

357
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,320
Get out.

358
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,720
Then leave. No matter how far you go,

359
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,200
we're only three words apart, "I love you."

360
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,140
Are you trying to kill me with laughter to inherit my wealth?

361
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,910
I'm telling you, that won't be possible.

362
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,960
It is possible!

363
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,050
As expected, you get me.

364
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,440
Every time I see you,

365
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,560
I start giving off pink... bubbles.

366
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,470
Keep going. Do you have to be so cheesy?

367
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,240
Okay, fine. I’m ticklish!

368
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,400
If you don't want to become a widow before you're even married,

369
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,960
then stop talking.

370
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,260
You know, I used to bottle everything inside.

371
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,230
Every time my boss made an unreasonable request,

372
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,390
even though I thought it was really stupid,

373
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,640
I could only smile and say yes.

374
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,220
You wanted to defy your boss?

375
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,720
Not really.

376
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,180
I just thought... why couldn't we communicate?

377
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,930
Maybe he would listen to my suggestions, right?

378
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,010
If he's a boss with a brain.

379
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,970
One day, I witnessed a robbery.

380
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,990
It was in broad daylight.

381
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,990
The thief forcefully pulled the necklace off an old lady's neck.

382
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,630
Then what?

383
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,070
Then, I wanted to report it.

384
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,370
So I went to the police station.

385
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,190
I even had a photo of the thief in my phone.

386
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,970
But the moment I entered the police station,

387
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,300
I became afraid.

388
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,530
I was afraid that if I reported it,

389
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,210
the thief may want revenge against me.

390
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,980
But then I thought, if I didn't go, then what would happen to that old lady?

391
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,310
Then what?

392
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:29,820
Then I kept thinking about this and that, this and that...

393
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,140
I spent two hours in front of the police station.

394
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,460
And then I got a heatstroke and fainted.

395
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:46,060
Afterwards I thought, some things you just shouldn't think too much about.

396
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,000
Just hurry up and do what you feel like doing.

397
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,430
I like you, so I have to let you know.

398
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,930
Say it again.

399
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,830
I like you.

400
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,850
Again.

401
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,570
I like you.

402
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:22,220
Maybe one day I won't be able to tell you anymore.

403
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:33,590
So starting today, I will say it everyday repeatedly.

404
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,420
Because that's how much I like you.

405
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,770
I'm going to keep saying it until you collapse.

406
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,300
You want me to collapse? It won't be easy.

407
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,960
I like you.

408
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,990
I've collapsed.

409
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,970
That fast?

410
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,470
I can't help it. Because it's you.

411
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,840
What's wrong?

412
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,100
You're too good to me.

413
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,520
Compared to my fantasies from the books I’ve read before,

414
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,660
you’re even better.

415
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,970
It's like you helped me fulfill

416
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,350
all the wishes I had in life.

417
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,140
How exaggerated.

418
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,790
What about you?

419
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,490
I want to know what kind of wishes you have.

420
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,160
What?

421
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,990
Maybe I can do something for you.

422
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,580
Your wish is to be an elementary student again?

423
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,920
What are you thinking?

424
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,780
Come with me.

425
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,180
Your elementary school classroom was so big!

426
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,520
This used to be my seat.

427
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,490
Hello, future overbearing CEO.

428
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:45,720
My brother always said that Dad only cared about me and never cared for him.

429
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,440
But it was because of him

430
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,260
that Dad never showed up to any of the important occasions of my life.

431
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,590
Situ Aoran.

432
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:10,050
Hello, teachers, family members, and classmates.

433
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,470
That day was Parent's Visitation Day.

434
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,210
The teacher chose me to give a speech.

435
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,780
But because my brother had a fight with a classmate,

436
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,590
Dad went to the hospital to discuss compensation with the classmate.

437
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,970
So if I had superpowers,

438
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,080
I want to become invisible

439
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,930
and only be visible to those I like.

440
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,730
Slowly, I got used to his absence.

441
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,190
In middle school, for the national debate competition,

442
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,710
when I came in first place in the entire country,

443
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,100
Bro was driving without a license and hit someone.

444
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,440
Smile.

445
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,180
Dad went to the police station.

446
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,470
One more picture.

447
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,140
Amazing.

448
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,150
On the day I graduated from college...

449
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,310
Again because of your brother?

450
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,400
He kept getting in trouble during that time.

451
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,230
Later, Dad decided to send him abroad.

452
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,410
But because he couldn't be at ease about it,

453
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,300
he and Mom personally dragged him to the US.

454
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,220
So your entire family was absent?

455
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,780
They said I could do well on my own without anyone anyway.

456
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,440
But on the other hand,

457
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,910
if I didn't live up to their expectations,

458
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,680
it was an absolute offense.

459
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,400
Actually, I was the invisible son.

460
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,600
I'll help fulfill your wish.

461
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,200
Hello, teachers, family members...

462
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:09,080
Hello, teachers and classmates.

463
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,350
I am Situ Aoran.

464
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,190
What I want to share with everyone today is

465
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,790
if I had a superpower...

466
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,750
Our Aoran is so great.

467
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,100
Hey, that's my husband.

468
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,060
Isn't he awesome?

469
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,580
He's number one in the whole world.

470
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,150
No, number one in the whole universe.

471
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,030
Champion.

472
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,290
Classmate Situ.

473
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,430
Congratulations on graduating.

474
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,740
Even though I know you'll become an overbearing CEO in the future,

475
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,980
I still wish you great success

476
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,990
and hope you become the CEO of a ten billion dollar company.

477
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,960
I already thought of a name for your company.

478
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,950
Let's call it Royal Group.

479
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,650
You'll be so handsome that you'll have no friends.

480
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,390
Everyone will revolve around you as if you're the center of everything.

481
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,970
No one will ever miss any important moments of your life.

482
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,970
Thank you.

483
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,870
Let's take a picture.

484
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,060
What about you?

485
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,300
Are your family members all like you?

486
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,130
I have no family.

487
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,200
I'm an orphan.

488
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,900
I've been alone since I was little.

489
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,230
So you don't have to worry about me.

490
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,010
I don't have any annoying siblings.

You have me.

492
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:04,020
In the future, we will have our own family.

493
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,980
And in the future, we will celebrate every important occasion together.

494
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:15,240
We even have to go receive awards together.

495
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:22,480
No matter what kind of ceremony it is, we have to take lots and lots of pictures together.

496
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,530
We're not allowed to miss each other's special occasions.

497
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,540
What's wrong?

498
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,470
Being able to participate in your past just now

is already very wonderful.

If we could have a future like that,

501
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,720
then it'd be...

502

00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,070
He really came.

650
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,530
How did he find us?

651
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,050
Hubby!

652
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,500
What are you doing?

653
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,070
Waiting for you.

654
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,310
What if I didn't come?

655
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:44,800
You will definitely come save me.

656
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,130
And that's reason to act up?

657
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,900
I'm not acting up.

658
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,990
Look! Isn't my husband super handsome?

659
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:54,160
- I wasn't lying nor messing around, right?
- That's enough!

660
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,760
My husband is so manly!

661
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,050
Bye!

662
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,360
Hubby!

663
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:11,010
I think there's a need to communicate with you before our marriage.

664
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,570
You're about to become a wife,

665
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:18,700
yet you still went messing around at a night club with friends.

666
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,230
Do you know how dangerous that was? What if you ran into bad people?

667
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,970
Pull my hand.

668
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,530
Why?

669
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,360
There's something I want to do.

670
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,560
What?

671
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,470
Pull my hand.

672
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,630
Hey, Zheng Xiao'en—

673
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,220
I'm here.

674
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,180
Come with me.

675
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:22,660
It's not that dark anymore, is it?

676
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,200
Yes.

677
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,580
If...

678
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:48,990
If you knew that we would disappear after having the wedding,

679
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,340
would you still marry me?

680
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,600
This disappearance you speak of... Where is it disappearing to?

681
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,560
Turning into nothingness in the universe,

682
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,870
being kidnapped and disappearing from population records,

683
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:11,940
or turning invisible and going to the ends of the world?

684
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,300
I don't know.

685
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,640
Yet you're still asking?

686
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,080
Regardless, we would disappear.

687
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,960
I just want to know whether you would still marry me if that were the case.

688
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,490
Don't even mention something as trivial as disappearing.

689
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:39,700
Even if I were to go to hell for marrying you,

690
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,660
I think I would still marry you.

691
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,570
I never knew you liked me that much.

692
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:51,130
Yes.

693
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,520
The moment I confirmed that I liked you,

694
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,860
it was no different from going to hell.

695

01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,240
The aforementioned is the distribution of the old chairman's will.

727
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,210
The details may only be examined by the kin of the He family.

728
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:46,030
Everyone should understand that aside from the inheritance of the old chairman's wife,

729
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:50,030
the old chairman gave the majority of the stocks to Young Master Tianxing

730
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:53,170
and left all movable and immovable assets to Young Master Tianjian.

731
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:56,840
Since Tianxing is currently in the hospital,

732
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:03,990
shouldn't we all support the most suitable candidate in today's reelection of the chairman?

733
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,600
Let's not overthink it.

734
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:20,020
Those who support our Young Master Tianjian, please declare your position.

735
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:45,090
Chairman, these are the financial reports,

736
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:48,430
the accounting structure, the shareholding ratio,

737
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,330
and the list of our manufacturing partners,

738
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:54,220
as well as other important company resources.

739
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,570
Have you looked through all of these?

740
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,930
Then, you can just explain it to me. I don't need to read it.

741
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,600
Okay.

742
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:12,050
Also, when Lawyer Wei and I were organizing the old chairman's assets from before he passed,

743
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,470
we discovered a sum of nearly NT$1 billion in funds, the purpose of which is unclear.

744
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,330
Even Lawyer Wei was not aware of this matter.

745
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,640
What about you?

746
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,700
You were Dad's most trusted aide. Even you didn't know?

747
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,480
Perhaps the old chairman deliberately kept it hidden.

748
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,460
After all, there may be a chance this NT$1 billion could be used

749
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,910
to save your sister's Tianliang Hospitality venture.

750
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:41,430
Just as I said, Tianliang Hospitality is a pit.

751
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,680
The company's financial status isn't too great right now.

752
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:49,860
Closing Tianliang Hospitality, the biggest leak, is a necessity.

753
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,190
If we need to close it, then close it.

754
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:53,880
Besides, no one's in the mood to put it back in order.

755
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,540
Okay.

756
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:59,190
Also, the old chairman actively promoted an investment project before he passed.

757
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:02,460
It's an overseas medical biotechnology company

758
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,490
which has secured exclusive technology for cell regeneration.

759
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,760
Medical biotechnology? That seems very impressive.

760
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,870
This is a future trend. We're sure to make a fortune.

761
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:18,700
It's a pity that your sister halted this investment project.

762
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,250
Why is that?

763
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,930
You understand your sister's temper.

764
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:26,570
As long as she doesn't like it, nothing anyone says makes a difference.

765
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,920
So, Chairman, would you like to continue with this investment project?

766
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,410
You decide. I have no opinion.

767
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:42,040
Yes.

768
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:53,470
Uncle Hu, did we find Tianxing yet?

769
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:05,680
These are the places Qiaozhi has gone during this time.

770
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,000

810
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:46,180
- Look at this.
- What is this?

811
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:53,890
I'm going to see if they need any help outside.

812
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:56,800
Then I'll go help Sister Susan.

813
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,950
No matter who you are, you're one of a kind in my heart.

814
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:17,670
I love you. I will love you forever.

815
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,750
So I'm back?

816
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:24,310
I have to find He Tianxing. I'm awake, so he must be awake too.

817
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,830
Tianxing!

818
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:29,360
He's waiting for me. He must be waiting for me.

819
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,970
It was not an accident that Tianliang Group's former CEO, He Tianxing, fell from the building.

820
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:37,950
Get rid of the witness immediately, no matter who it is.

821
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:51,140
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

822
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,210
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

823
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:59,680
♫ A quiet strike ♫

824
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,990
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

825
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:05,240
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

826
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,300
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

827
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:12,690
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

828
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:17,360
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

829
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,590
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

830
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:25,530
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

831
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:30,260
♫ If I could see you again ♫

832
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:36,960
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

833
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,090
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

834
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:50,300
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

835
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,040
♫ If you were a painter ♫

836
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,010
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

837
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,170
♫ No regrets ♫

838
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:05,510
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
