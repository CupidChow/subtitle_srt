There's nothing I'd miss here anyway.

I like Chuchu, so naturally I was looking forward to this date.

When she didn't come, I actually felt a bit relieved.

Since I couldn't return even after being determined to die,

Oh, right. Why are you short on money?

I... I want to buy a luxury bag.

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,990
I've never seen you carry a luxury bag.

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,440
It's because I don't have one that I want to carry it.

You work so hard, and there's not much I can do to help you.

I can only give you this.

78
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,100
- What is it?
- Vitamin B that helps you replenish your energy.

79
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,500
It also has three major beauty nutrients that can make you look good from the inside out.

80
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,320
She even has the same vitamins as the CEO?

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,580
Girls should look good even when busy.

82
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,950
This has added vitamin C which can boost collagen production.

83
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,910
You must remember to eat it.

84
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,980
Don't worry, I'll eat it well. I won't lose to you.

And then?

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,910
CEO isn't mad that I stood him up. Thank goodness.

That's not surprising.

Oh, right. What exactly did you tell the CEO that day?

90
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,790
- Me?
- He even asked about you today.

91
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,050
What did he ask about?

92
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,590
He seemed really worried that you'd spread pneumonia to your colleagues,

93
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,080
so he asked to confirm whether you were sick.

94
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,160
In his eyes, I'm a virus strain.

95
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,060
I don't think he means it that way.

96
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,810
Xiao'en, don't misunderstand.

97
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,100
Based on my understanding of him, he does mean it that way.

98
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,840
You're done drinking the soup?

99
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm full. This virus needs to be disinfected.

- Meow. Long time no see.
- Meow.

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,360
The photocopier is broken.

118
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,820
Both photocopiers are broken? But I was using it just recently.

119
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,170
So it was you who broke them?

120
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,660
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

Excuse me.

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,450
The director said to arrange this properly in the order of one, two, three, four, and five.

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,010
When you've properly arranged it, let me know.

Okay.

127
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,720
It's urgent.

128
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,340

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,020
No need. I'll go down.

134
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,620
I happen to have something to take care of downstairs. I'll bring it to her.

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,070
What business do you happen to have downstairs?

136
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,010
You want to see Chuchu?

137
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,180
What's wrong? Isn't this the document you wanted?

138
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,530
Yes. Thank you, CEO.

139
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,340
Did the CEO take the wrong medicine today?

140
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,010
Why did he suddenly descend to the human world?

141
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,950
I don't know either. Maybe he's in a good mood today.

142
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,500
Why are there so few people in the office today?

143
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,940
Ah, Chuchu went to deliver documents to the manufacturer.

144
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,970
CEO.

145
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,760
So it was this.

146
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,590
I understand now. I should've known.

147
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,290
- Did it go well at the manufacturer?
- Yes. It went smoothly with no issues.

148
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,940
- It's hot outside, right?
- Thank you.

149
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,060
Oh, right. Why did you come here?

150
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,730
I happened to have some business so I brought documents on the way.

151
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,020
CEO, what are you looking at?

152
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,860
Or are you looking for someone?

153
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,970
Where is Zheng Xiao'en?

154
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,840
Where did she go during working hours?

155
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,000
Zheng Xiao'en went to meet with the manufacturer.

156
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,630
Is that so?

157
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,980
You all worked hard. Keep it up.

158
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,620
So he came to keep watch of Xiao'en.

159
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,430
Xiao'en is really unfortunate.

160
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,410
I never would’ve thought that in the CEO’s heart, she would still be on the dark side.

161
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,500
Comrade, you've worked hard.

162
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,060
Will we have to miss her again?

163
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,700
Xiao'en, hold on.

164
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,750
I have to work my butt off during the day and the night.

165
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,660
I'm going to have a sudden death sooner or later.

166
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,140
No. The romance novel world is still beautiful, right?

167
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,170
I can't die. I have to hold on. I have to hang on. I—

168
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,620
That's not right.

169
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,560
If I die, will I be able to return to the real world?

170
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,250
Will I be able to see Chuntian?

[Susan]

172
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,610
Hello?

173
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,260
Where are you? The CEO just descended to the human world.

174
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,010
He saw that you weren't at your seat and assumed that you're slacking off.

175
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,570
He seems really angry! Hurry and come back!

176
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,660
He's angry? I'm the one that's angry!

177
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,860
I'm already overworking myself for his precious darling.

178
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,930
He still has the energy to care about me?

179
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,170
Believe it or not, I'll—

180
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,590
I'll—

181
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,330
I'll come back immediately.

182
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,240
Why does he seem so familiar?

183
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,770
You also work here?

184
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,200
Yes.

185
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,040
Is Situ Aoran here?

186
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,990
The CEO?

187
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,360
Who is asking?

188
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,210
I am his brother.

189
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,080
He Tianjian! Remove the source of our troubles!

190
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,980
Did you forget what we did to his mother?

191
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,600
Are you okay?

192
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,810
Miss. Miss. Miss!

193
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,930
- Qingfeng?
- What happened to Xiao'en?

194
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,670
I'm going to take Xiao'en to the hospital. Notify Situ for me.

195
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,450
Hey!

196
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,130
You won't even greet me anymore?

197
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,670
Hi, Qingfeng! Bye, Qingfeng!

200
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,850
Baby Situ!

201
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,430
Is your surname not Situ as well?

202
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,140
Although both our surnames are Situ, it's still a bit different.

203
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,210
It's like how Duanmu calls you Situ directly,

204
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,310
but I'm only Situ's older brother to him.

205
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,000
But he leaves out the part about me being the most handsome one.

206
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,890
Didn't you open a bar overseas? When did you come back?

207
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,160
Why didn't you let me know in advance?

208
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,670
The bar went out of business, so I came back. What's there to say?

209
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,280
Also, my sudden return made someone faint from my handsomeness.

210
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,640
If I gave advance notice, then wouldn't the entire Royal Group riot?

211
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,100
Hey, I'm being serious.

212
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,790
My handsomeness caused a girl to faint right when I came back.

213
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,010
Because I didn't want to cause a commotion,

214
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,430
I forced myself to come to your office, which has no women.

215
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,750
Sorry that you have to suffer. Stay here.

216
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,010
Don't wander around and play with innocent female employees.

217
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,950
Wow! You really don't believe me?

218
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,350
Just now. It happened just now.

219
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,450
Someone named Xiao'en fainted right in front of me.

220
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,740
Duanmu even rushed to take her to the hospital.

221
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,490
- Who?
- Duanmu.

222
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,200
The one who fainted.

223
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,830

226
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,060
- Why are you here?
- Why didn't you tell me?

227
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,720
I asked Moran to help me take leave from work.

228
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,150
Why did you still come?

229
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,930
- Where is she?
- Wait.

230
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,690
Chuchu is here too.

231
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,030
It's all your fault for making me lose my place in line.

232

You're awake.

233
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,230
Do you still feel unwell?

234
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,070
I'm fine.

235
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,910
You've done so much for me.

236
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,980
Yet I can't do anything for you.

237

I feel like I'm so useless.

238

Xiao'en. You have to get better.

239
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,330
I'm fine! I was just dizzy for a bit.

240
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,410
And you crying like this is a signal for the overbearing CEO to show up.

241
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,550
CEO.

242
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,340
Are you okay?

243
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,760
I'm fine.

244
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,970
What exactly happened?

245
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,690
It's all because of me.

246
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,380
What's wrong?

247
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,780
On the day that I didn't show up at the amusement park,

248
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,540
there was actually an incident at my house.

249
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,040
What does that have to do with Zheng Xiao'en?

250
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,070
My family owes money because of my dad's illness so the debt collection company came to collect our debt.

251
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,010
Xiao'en has been working at a part-time job to help me.

252
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,220
Perhaps because of this, her body couldn't handle it anymore.

Zheng Xiao'en.

254

Why are you being such a busybody?

255
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,500
What do you mean a busybody?

256
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,460
You're calling me a busybody?

257
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,860
No, what I mean is,

258
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,290
since something like this happened, why didn't you come to me?

259
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,170
No way. I've caused you enough trouble already.

260
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,980
How could I bother you with my family matters?

261
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,780
I... I know you're very kind and don't want to trouble me.

262
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,400
But you can't let...

263
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,970
let a girl face it on her own.

264
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,400
But now that I know about this, leave it to me.

265
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,310
CEO.

266
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,780
Is there a problem?

267
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,030
What's with the attitude?

268
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,300
Xiao'en, what's wrong?

269
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,370
Xiao'en is probably tired. Let her get some rest.

270
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,090
- I want Xiao'en to—
- Yeah!

271
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,660
Xiao'en's complexion doesn't look so great.

272
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,450
Let's leave and let Xiao'en rest.

273
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,580
- But—
- Chuchu's right.

274
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,560
Is there anything that has to be said now?

275
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,960
- Just—
- Enough!

276
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,050
I have to say it now.

277
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,060
So that Xiao'en can get better rest,

278
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,820
switch her to a single room this instant.

279
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,670
Hire a personal caretaker.

280
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,000
Also, buy whatever she needs. Put it onto my tab.

281
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,310
You can tell me anything.

282
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,980
Don't think to bear all the burdens by yourself.

283
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,940
Got it.

284
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,700
I understand.

285
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,470
Alright. They all left.

286
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,060
I'll treat you to food.

287
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,080
I'll make whatever you say appear.

288
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,970
Perhaps I can even make popcorn chicken appear.

289
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,270
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

290
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:04,450
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

291
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,760
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

292
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,710
Alright. They all left.

293
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,470
I'll treat you to food.

294
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,420
I'll make whatever you say appear.

295
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,020
Perhaps I can even make popcorn chicken appear.

296
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,960
You promised me.

297
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,740
What?

298
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,550
You promised me you wouldn't cry again.

299
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,720
Didn't I hide it under the blanket?

300
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,950
Who told you to lift my blanket?

301
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,500
Once again, I experienced that

302
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,280
no matter how hard you try,

303
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,260
you can't triumph over the ring of light around the main leads.

304
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,510
There's nothing to cry about.

305
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,650
Have you ever thought

306
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,400
that perhaps you're working in the wrong direction?

307
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,980
What's wrong?

308
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,530
If two people are set to be together,

309
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,560
then a third person doesn't necessarily have to get involved, right?

310
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,600
What you mean is

311
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,510
you don't want to be involved anymore?

312
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,910
When was I talking about me?

313
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,140
If you don't want to be involved, then what are you going to do?

314
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,290
Isn't there still the alien?

315
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,750
You...

316
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,700
Are you using me to boost your self-esteem because you've suffered a setback in love?

317
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,060
Comrade, I understand how you feel.

318
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,660
I was like this before too.

319
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,820
- I'm not—
- Even if you don't get your first choice in love,

320
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,100
don't ever settle for your second choice.

321
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,170
It's better to grow old alone

322
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,870
than to burden yourself in an effort to rescue your pitiful friend.

323
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,710
Got it?

324
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,350
I just think that if you go on like this, you'll get really hurt.

325
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,180
Let's stop talking about this.

326
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,970
Why did you suddenly faint outside the company?

327
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,030
Oh right! I forgot to ask you...

328
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,880
I saw a really scary person.

329
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,870
Who?

330
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,670
The one who was speaking to me.

331
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,980
Did you see him when you came out?

332
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,620
Moran?

333
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,670
Another "ran"?

334
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,910
He is Aoran's older half-brother, Situ Moran.

335
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,040
Is he a bad person?

336
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,120
I wouldn't go that far.

337
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,610
It's just that his personality is a bit too casual and bold.

338
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,870
His investments are a bit too wild.

339
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,550
His failure rate is a bit too high.

340
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,190
Does he show any hostility towards Aoran?

341
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,430
Aoran's never mentioned that.

342
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,110
You have to warn the CEO to be careful of this person.

343
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,380
Why?

344
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,750
I'm an alien, so I have a natural gift of sniffing out danger.

345
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,230
You remember how I prevented so many accidents.

346
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,270
Okay, I'll keep watch.

347
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,880
I want to be discharged from the hospital.

348
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,180
You? Have you fully recovered?

349
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,020
Of course! I'm fine. All four limbs are fully healthy.

350
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,270
My complexion is rosy, isn't it?

351
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,190
Susan, didn't you call Xiao'en to tell her to come back quickly?

352
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,610
Why hasn't Xiao'en shown up even though we're off work now?

353
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,620
No idea what Xiao'en is so busy with these days.

354
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,140
Yeah, she acts so sneaky and won't say anything even when we ask her.

355
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,290
Yeah. Strange.

356
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,040
Aren't these the two beauties from the marketing department?

357
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,390
Hello, Young Master!

358
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,380
Young Master, you're back?

359
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,730
Did your investments fai—

360
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,990
It's been a while since we've seen you.

361
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,450
No worries. I overheard you talking about Xiao'en.

362
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,240
You know Xiao'en too?

363
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,280
Are you kidding me? Which female worker don't I know?

364
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,550
It only takes one look for me to match her face to her name.

365
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,280
Admirable, admirable.

366
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,550
I throw myself down in worship.

367
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,910
What I want to ask is why are you in a rush for Xiao'en to come back?

368
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,840
All because of the CEO.

369
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,910
Aoran really cares about her?

370
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,630
About that...

371
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,090
It's hard to say.

372
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,710
If it's hard to say, then take your time. I have all day.

373
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,780
What is their relationship like now?

374
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,910
Their relationship?

375
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,010
- It's like a room with the lights turned off.
- It's dark.

376
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,190
- A lunchbox with food that has gone bad.
- It stinks.

377
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,360
- If Xiao'en were a mouse...
- Then the CEO would be a cat.

378
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
- If Xiao'en were an antelope...
- Then the CEO would be a leopard.

379
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,310
- If Xiao'en were a rabbit...
- Then the CEO would be a wolf.

380
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,060
- If Xiao'en were a—
- Wait! Okay, okay.

381
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,620
I got it. So they're natural enemies,

382
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,260
and it's the kind where Xiao'en is watched closely by Aoran.

383
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,200
But it doesn't seem like that.

384
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,590
It's true. Our Xiao'en doesn't deserve to be targeted by the CEO like that.

385
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,760
Why is that?

386
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,850
It's all because of that poisonous woman, Chuchu.

387
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,910
Chuchu? Who's that?

388
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:29,330
This seems... interesting.

389
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,910
She's here.

390
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,500
Mingli, your dad is so pitiful like this.

391
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,700
Can we not force him anymore?

392
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,200
He deserves this.

393
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,870
How can you say such words?

394
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,800
I read his will.

395
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,520
Then...

396
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,750
He left the company to Tianxing.

397
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,010
All his other assets went to Tianjian.

398
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,970
What about me?

399
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,460
He didn't mention me in the will even once.

400
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,420
Am I, He Mingli, not part of the He family?

401
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,360
Child, why are you making a fuss over such a small matter?

402
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,070
You want to get a share of an inheritance? Then get married.

403
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,670
When your husband passes, you'll get half of it naturally.

404
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,830
As a woman, how can you say such words so calmly?

405
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,410
What is your problem?

406
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,170
You're the one with the problem!

407
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:51,490
You're a woman who's fighting other people to the death all the time.

408
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,110
You're not elegant at all.

409
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,120
Every time I get together with friends,

410
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,840
I’m embarrassed to death whenever you are mentioned.

411
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,230
Mom!

412
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,610
See? You're doing it again.

413
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,910
What are you getting irritable for?

414
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,250
Look at you. You have dark circles.

415
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,550
If you're too tired, then get some rest.

416
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,920
You can leave the company to Tianjian.

417
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,470
You cry so easily all the time.

418
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,600
Yet you have the most ruthless heart.

419
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,030
This will be the last time.

420
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,440
From now on, none of you will be able to hurt me.

421
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,980
[CEO, we're waiting for you to recover]
[CEO, wake up]

422
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,960
Chairwoman, other people will see you like this.

423
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,970
So what if they see?

424
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,280
He Tianxing's lying there unmoving,

425
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,340
yet all they have in their hearts is He Tianxing.

426
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:32,630
I don't care about what others think of me anymore.

427
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,950
[You are the best CEO in the world]
[Tianliang Group needs you]

428
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,440
[CEO He, we love you]
[Get well, Boss]

429
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,450
Sis.

430
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,160
Did you get your hands on the will?

431
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,870
I want to read it too.

432
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,440
You don't have to.

433
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,820
Why? I'm Dad's son.

434
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,240
I have the right to read it, don't I?

435
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,930
Are you trying to brag about being a son to me right now?

436
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,700
What are you saying?

437
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,170
You and that bastard son, He Tianxing,

438
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,580
never have to doubt whether your name will appear on the will or not.

439
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,200
But what about me?

440
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,050
I wish I never had to read such a horrific thing.

441
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,960
You want the will, don't you?

442
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,570
What are you doing?

443
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
You're crazy.

444
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,380
Tianliang's stocks are crashing right now.

445
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,550
I propose to switch out the chairwoman!

446
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,100
- You shut up!
- Every decision you made has affected Tianliang's stock price.

447
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,150
The company has already lost billions of dollars.

448
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,970
Tianliang has never experienced such a loss before.

449
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,960
Mingli, step down.

450
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,630
All of you, shut up!

451
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,750
How long have I been the chairwoman?

452
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,470
None of you can judge me like this!

453
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,770
Too much has happened recently.

454
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,040
The workers went on strike.

455
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,680
The company's management kept having issues.

456
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,870
Did I do all of that?

457
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,170
You all didn't even give me time to react.

458
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,980
There's no need!

459
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,200
By the time you act, Tianliang will be destroyed!

460
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,930
Hand it over to Tianxing immediately!

461
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,290
You won't be able to handle it.

462
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,900
Just hand it over to Tianjian.

463
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,540
What are you trying to prove?

464
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,010
I don't have a sister like you.

465
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,080
He Mingli, just admit defeat.

466
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,550
You're just incapable.

467
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,650
Shut up.

468
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,210
Go back to being the pretentious rich daughter!

469
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,480
Yes, you can join me for flower arrangement classes.

470
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,040
Is there anything I don't know about you?

471
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,110
I already knew that you weren't as good as me.

472
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,710
You deliberately forced your way to become chairwoman, and look what happened.

473
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,330
Shut up! All of you, shut up!

474
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,970
Shut up!

475
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,000
Shut up!

476
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,040
Chairwoman.

477
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,780
How is he?

478
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,640
The same.

479
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,890
I'll definitely keep a close watch.

480
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,240
If anything happens, I'll immediately report it to you.

481
00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:00,630
Starting from now, don't let anyone come and see He Tianxing.

482
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,010
Including He Tianjian.

483
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,730
- Even Young Master?
- No.

484
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:11,020
Also, have someone install a security camera in the patient room tomorrow.

485
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,420
I need to make sure that I can immediately monitor

486
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,360
He Tianxing's condition every minute and every second.

487
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,990
I understand.

488
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,490
Everything's okay.

489
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,600
I will definitely win.

490
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,380
No one can stop me.

491
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,530
No one.

492
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,330
I will definitely win.

493
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,840
I will definitely win.

494
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,100
Why can't I fall asleep?

495
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,220
Is this insomnia?

496
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,180
What is there to keep me from sleeping?

497
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,600
Zheng Xiao'en, what were you acting up for?

498
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,140
Did I just say "Zheng Xiao'en"?

499
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,640
So I'm worried about her?

500
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,470
So Zheng Xiao'en's the reason that I can't sleep?

501
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,030
No way.

502
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,020
Chuchu is the one who has family issues.

503
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,340
Yes, I should be worried about Chuchu.

504
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,540
That's my mission.

505
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,910
[Chuchu]

506
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,910
[When you’re done, get some rest.]
[Okay. Thank you, CEO.]

507
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,630
What do I want to say?

508
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,930
[Xiao'en]

509
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,380
Are you feeling a bit better?

510
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,680
Thank you for your concern, CEO. I'm well.

511
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,950
Did I send the message to Chuchu?

512
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,300
Is that so? Okay, understood.

513
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,200
What a focused gaze.

514
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,240
Have you fallen in love with me?

515
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,580
Did you help Chuchu return the money to Xiao'en?

516
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,200
- Of course.
- Check?

517
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,520
- Yes.
- The bank said she hasn't cashed it in.

518
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,980
You even called to ask?

519
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,880
She probably just got to work and didn't have time to do it yet.

520
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,780
Does the company give her that much work?

521
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,240
Doesn't she love money the most?

522
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,900
What did you say?

523
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,200
What about the gift bought for her?

524
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,490
What gift?

525
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,870
A gift to thank her for helping Chuchu.

526
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,510
- Ah, I bought it.
- What did you buy?

527
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,040
Something girls probably like.

528
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,840
Probably? You don't know what the gift is?

529
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,540
I asked the female store employee to pick it out.

530
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,920
- The store employee?
- Yes.

531
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,910
You're too careless.

532
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,110
How could you ask a store employee to pick out a gift?

533
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,040
Does the store employee know Zheng Xiao'en?

534
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,190
What if she doesn't like it?

535
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,660
She can exchange it if she doesn't like it.

536
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,340
Then Zheng Xiao'en would have to go to the store.

537
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,540
That's better than having to keep a gift she doesn't like.

538
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,740
Then why didn't you just buy a gift that she would like?

539
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,230
Aren't you usually a very careful person?

540
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,040
Why did you go off-script when giving this gift?

541
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,090
Off-script?

542
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,940
I helped you deliver money and a gift, yet you say I'm going off-script?

543
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,180
Weren't you the one who said you would take on everything and resolve it for Chuchu?

544
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,880
Weren't you the one who said you would return money and give a gift to Xiao'en?

545
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,590
And weren't you the one who then turned around and gave me all the work?

546
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,940
This is all additional work for me, okay?

547
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,440
If you're so unsatisfied, do it yourself.

548
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,200
I'm very busy.

549
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,480
You think I wanted to pass the buck?

550
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,700
If I could do it myself, I would.

551
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,270
The problem is that I'm not close enough to Xiao'en to know what she likes.

552
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,200
Now a boss can't even say a few words?

553
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,750
He leaves as he pleases!

554
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,960
I haven't even asked how Zheng Xiao'en is doing lately.

555
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,000
[Marketing Department Meeting at 2:00 PM]

556
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,850
♫ Lost to you ♫

557
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:56,110
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

558
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:59,910
♫ If you were a painter ♫

559
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,250
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

560
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:09,310
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

561
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:15,810
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

562
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,940
Why are you so late?

563
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,040
CEO, you're here early.

564
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,590
You're the one who's late.

565
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,000
CEO, I'm sorry for being late.

566
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,620
Regarding the marketing plan for the hot spring resort that we recently invested in—

567
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,420
Wait.

568
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,930
Where are the other people from the marketing department?

569
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,810
Other people?

570
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,760
It's always just been me.

571
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,060
This is the first time that we're not only investing capital

572
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,910
but also collaborating with the resort on marketing—

573
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,060
- Ask them to come.
- What?

574
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,630
Everyone wrote the report together.

575
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,010
Everyone will have a sense of participation by attending the meeting together.

576
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,670
But I'm reporting everyone's opinion now.

577
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,400
It's possible for them to have new ideas when they see me.

578
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,500
Attention, everyone. Sort your things and go to the conference room for a meeting.

579
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,310
Hurry.

580
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,420
Why are we going?

581
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,470
The CEO asked everyone to go pay respects to his handsome face.

582
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,710
- Really?
- What do you think?

583
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,410
Really. It must be true.

584
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,970
In the past, didn't you just report things by yourself?

585
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,750
What do you think?

586
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,600
I'll work hard.

587
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,610
If there's a chance for me to help, I'll do my best.

588
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:36,050
How great! There's afternoon tea.

589
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:39,390
- Thank you, CEO.
- Thank you, CEO.

590
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,010
What's wrong?

591
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,040
It's too sweet.

592
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,240
I'll start now.

593
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,180
Previously, our company directly searched for the subject to invest in.

594
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,350
This hot spring resort project is our first time not only investing capital,

595
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,280
but also directly participating in the operations.

596
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,570
Because of this, we plan to launch an event at the tourism exhibition

597
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,170
to attract more potential partners.

598
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,900
Listed here are the companies we could possibly partner up with.

599
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,070
We've done market research on all these companies?

600
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,580
We've conducted in-depth analyses on these companies' assets,

601
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,970
credit ratings, and financial statements for the past five years.

602
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,480
What?

603
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,990
Do you have any thoughts on Susan's report?

604
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,230
Thoughts?

605
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,970
Yes. Aren't you in the marketing department?

606
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,940
I think...

607
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,410
I think that her report is really good.

608
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,060
That's it?

609
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,270
I wrote this report myself.

610
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,100
How can I praise myself?

611
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,570
Apart from the information on here,

612
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,630
do you not have any new ideas?

613
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,250
Say more.

614
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,970
Xiao'en is so unfortunate!

615
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,610
She really is.

616
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,650
Now I know that if you're on the dark side in the CEO's heart for one day...

617
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,910
It means you’ll be on the dark side for life.

618
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,020
- It's hopeless for her.
- Too hopeless.

619
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,060
If I had any new ideas, I would've written them in the report.

620
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,200
Do you not continue to ponder after writing the report?

621
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,820
Why do I feel like you're targeting my IQ?

622
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,060
But I'm left speechless.

623
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,250
I'm not saying that you're dumb.

624
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:26,350
I just... want to unlock your hidden potential.

625
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,090
Think harder.

626
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:31,200
We have lots of time. No pressure.

627
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,290
No pressure?

628
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,120
Then what's considered pressure?

629
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,290
Xiao'en is so unfortunate.

630
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,990
So unfortunate.

631
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,350
- I—
- I recall that today's objective is to review the report.

632
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,730
Not a meeting to come up with new ideas.

633
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:52,690
Give them some more time to go back and think.

634
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,690
Aren't we reviewing so that we can do better next time?

635
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,110
- Right?
- You're right.

636
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,500
Because I actually went to the hot spring resort with the CEO,

637
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,880
I realized how important it is to make correct investments.

638
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,850
Our company's money didn't fall from the sky.

639
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,470
Funds must be used in the right places.

640
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,960
Of course, we can also make simple investments as we've done before.

641
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,410
But after this practical partnership,

642
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:18,820
I think that our company's growth won't just be an increase in numbers,

I think...

Can you not target me anymore?

I'll pray for you.

Have you received the money and gift?

- Yes.
- Why haven't you cashed it in yet?

Oh, I haven't had time to yet.

- Then, do you like the gift?
- It's okay.

00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,470
- I heard you can exchange it.
- What?

673
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,250
The gift. If you don't like it, you can exchange it.

674

Why do you care if I exchange it?

Do you know where to exchange it?

- I can ask Qingfeng. I mean the CSO.

No.

Wait.

You've done Chuchu a huge favor.

00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,400
Not only money and gifts,

but if there's anything you still want,

685

He wants to remind me that he has Chuchu now.

Understood. I'll head down now.

Didn't she say she understood?

693

If she understands, why did she have such a reaction?

694

Am I not handsome anymore?

Is my money not appealing anymore?

Or was there a problem with the way I expressed it?

697
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,610
Why did she look so unhappy?

698
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,700
Done talking?

699
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,060
What did you guys talk about?

About how capitalism maximizes its effectiveness in a romance.

He asked me if I liked the gift and if I could cash in the check as soon as possible.

703
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,700
Otherwise the overbearing CEO will file a restraining order to prevent me from approaching her.

704
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,550
He really said that?

705
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,250
Of course not.

706
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,990
He just sincerely asked me to quickly accept his token of appreciation.

Aoran also wants to thank you.

So your body has no issues anymore?

Of course. I was just shocked.

sprinkle things on me, do things to me, and get rid of things.

725

I'd be good after that.

I really don't understand you.

727
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,500
You were so shocked that you fainted.

728
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,710
Why not go to a hospital?

729
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,740
That was the Tennessee goat reaction.

730
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,940
It was muscle stiffness, not fainting.

- I don't want to.
- Why?

It's because your methods of alleviating stress are very awful.

What is a grown man like you doing pilates for?

786

Pilates can not only improve your posture and muscular endurance,

01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:31,510
but also help with your ability to control your body and mind.

You ladies can't possibly be on the verge of collapse just to look at Qingfeng?

That's really the case.

792
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,930
Now you know I'm not too shabby, right?

793
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:04,260
So what if you're not too shabby?

794
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,000
Even if you're not too shabby, it's still other people who think so.
(Implying it's not Chuchu who thinks so.)

795
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,920
Since it's other people,

I'll help you pick a good one.

The second one to the left isn't bad.

798

It's too bad her height isn't quite adequate when paired with you.

- That's right.
- Why?

It's because you're a person who treats others with sincerity.

802

You make me feel like this world is especially full of warmth.

803

Before, Chuntian was my only good friend,

804
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:59,140
but meeting you here made me feel as if

805

I'm no longer a little corporate slave in this big, big world.

806
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:15,930
So, for a thoughtful, gentlemanly, good-looking, and gentle friend like you,

807
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:19,820
I must meticulously pick a girl of the best quality for you.

808
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,260
I absolutely won't let you be alone in the end.

809
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,520
Okay, students. Let's practice our partner yoga today.

810
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,330
Students who are stronger, please lie on the floor.

811
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:33,730
For the lighter students, you'll be on top.

812
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:37,040
Get ready for today's practice.

813
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:46,000
With this physique and a full body of muscles,

814
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,020
I'll definitely help you find a...

815
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:13,430
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

816
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:19,620
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

817
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:26,020
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

818
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,740
With this physique and a full body of muscles,

819
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,980
I'll definitely help you find a...

820
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,910
You have no strength?

821
01:05:55,910 --> 01:06:00,380
Fake abs. You look strong on the outside but are weak on the inside.

822
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,740
Such a fool.

823
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,150
[Supple House]

824
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,920
I'm done. Does it look nice?

825
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,050
It looks nice.

826
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:26,890
Can we engrave our initials and exchange it as gifts?

827
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:30,030
You have to keep it with you. No throwing it away.

828
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,570
Maybe I'm too sensitive, but every time you don't respond,

829
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:44,310
I feel like you're thinking about something I don't know about.

830
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,220
It's my bad.

831
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:52,330
Then... engrave our names?

832
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:21,410
The restaurant is still open.

833
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,640
CEO, are you hungry?

834
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,990
Should we both...?

835
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,740
Rest early.

836
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,030
Today was very fun. Thank you, CEO.

837
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:40,640
The pilates you did earlier went to waste.

838
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,830
Isn't the focus to have spiritual growth?

839
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,530
It's to have control over your body and mind.

840
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:49,630
What you're doing is completely uncontrolled.

841
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:52,890
I'll stop eating after I finish this.

842
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:57,220
You said that when you were eating the grilled squid.

843
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:01,580
I didn't expect that there would be street food here from my past life.

844
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:04,500
It was on the spur of the moment. Next time, I—

845
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,850
Will still eat.

846
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,920
♫ I'm used to sitting in the corner by the window ♫

847
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,060
♫ Watching how many scroll through their phones with their heads down ♫

848
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,890
♫ How did showing concern just become hitting "like"? ♫

849
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:32,520
♫ Hearing greetings which are reduced to a message ♫

850
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,930
♫ Lonely because there's no overlap between you and me ♫

851
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:39,720
♫ Doing our own thing, can't clearly see our long distance ♫

852
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,120
♫ A guitar in my hands ♫

853
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,940
♫ A night for two people ♫

854
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,480
♫ Playing a forgotten melody ♫

855
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,920
♫ I'm strumming ♫

856
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,380
Aoran?

857
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,440
She just fainted not long ago, yet you're letting her stay out so late?

858
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,190
I'm taking her home.

859
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,030
Is this your woman?

860
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,510
When did you become the CEO's woman?

861
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:32,410
The great demon king in my life is Zheng Xiao'en.

862
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:33,950
I like her.

863
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,070
I'm just afraid that Zheng Xiao'en is toying with you.

864
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,370
How do you know that I don't want to be toyed with?

865
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:41,500
Why did you call me He Tianxing the first time we met?

866
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,450
Who exactly is He Tianxing?

867
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:45,490
He's a very special person.

868
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:49,160
In my heart, he's very important.

869
01:10:57,990 --> 01:11:01,300
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

870
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,380
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

871
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:09,770
♫ A quiet strike ♫

872
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,970
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

873
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:15,350
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

874
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,440
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

875
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,820
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

876
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,430
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

877
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,720
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

878
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,620
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

879
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:40,370
♫ If I could see you again ♫

880
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:46,970
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

881
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:51,230
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

882
01:11:51,230 --> 01:12:00,460
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

883
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:04,080
♫ If you were a painter ♫

884
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,120
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

885
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:10,290
♫ No regrets ♫

886
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:16,000
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
