[Lost Romance]

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,130
[Chapter One]

17
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,150
In the midst of hot steam, the silhouette of a man who emits an icy aura stands against the light.

18
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,200
Hot water soaks his thick, pitch-black hair.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,140
Beneath the water drops, his facial features are finely chiseled.

20
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,280
Exquisite muscles rise and fall with every breath.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
Like a cheetah.

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,970
His eyes seem like bottomless pools

23
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,770
that exude an unfathomable black gleam.

24
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,280
Sharp corners of his mouth outline a cold curve.

25
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,090
A mocking smile makes him seem even more indifferent and arrogant.

26
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,030
A devious charm.

27
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,140
Once the car door opens, his long straight legs and impressive aura

28
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,850
make it so that everyone can't help but lower their heads, hold their breaths,

29
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,840
and not look directly at him.

30
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,530
Good morning, Chief Strategy Officer!

31
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,240
Good morning, Boss.

32
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,970
A height of 180 centimeters allows him to be even more eye-catching in a crowd.

33
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,110
A slightly fitted outfit wraps around his body,

34
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,220
laying bare his perfect physique.

35
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,850
He strides forward with a graceful gait like a cheetah's.

36
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,280
Faintly giving off a dangerous odor of

37
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,230
being able to catch his prey at any time.

38
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,960
Why cheetahs again?

39
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,130
What did the cheetahs do wrong?

40
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,100
I know, right?

41
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,540
Eight out of ten of our romance novels have male protagonists who are like cheetahs.

42
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,530
So weird! Why can't it be a giraffe?

43
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,000
A giraffe probably won't work,

44
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,090
but I think a lion or tiger could be okay.

45
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,770
Lion? Tiger?

46
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,050
[Lion]

47
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,680
Aren't they all the same?

48
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,030
What's the title of this new book?

49
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,850
CEO, You're So Naughty.

50
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,770
Does it have to be so straightforward?

51
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,560
There's no other way.

52
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,540
Right now the romance novel market is in a slump.

53
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,130
If you don't make the title more straightforward, you won't be able to grab the attention of the reader.

54
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,270
That's true. It's already 2020. No one wants to read about an overbearing CEO anymore.

55
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,960
That's not true! No matter what year it is, everyone needs an overbearing CEO.

56
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,810
Is there anything in the world more heartwarming than an overbearing CEO?

57
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,110
Really?

58
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,820
Of course.

59
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,020
Of all the recent top-selling movies, which ones did not feature an overbearing CEO?

60
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,300
Is Christian Grey an overbearing CEO?
(50 Shades of Gray)

61
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,960
Yes.

62
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,430
Is Bruce Wayne an overbearing CEO?
(Batman)

63
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,740
Is Tony Stark an overbearing CEO?
(Iron Man)

64
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,390
Yes, yes, yes! Very overbearing!

65
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,270
That's right.

66
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,730
No matter the age or gender, everyone needs an overbearing CEO, okay?

67
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,670
Overbearing CEOs can't die!

68
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,810
Okay, okay. Then what's the background of this new overbearing CEO?

69
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,590
The CEO of a venture capital company with a net worth of NT$10 billion (~US$337 million), Situ Aoran.

70
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,740
Situ Aoran?
(Aoran means proud, lofty)

71
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,300
Oh come on! Last time that... what was his name?

72
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,960
Murong Lenglie?
(Lenglie means cold)

73
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,810
Are all the names of overbearing CEOs this pretentious?

74
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,410
You're so annoying! That's called being assertive!

75
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,060
Okay.

76
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,250
The romance novel world is just so simple and dull.

77
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,290
It really is a bit dull.

78
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,520
Hey, the books we published this month,

79
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,960
CEO, Don't Stop,

80
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,280
CEO, Stand Aside,

81
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,780
and CEO, Love Me...

82
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,370
Other than the characters' names being different, what else is different?

83
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,520
Aren't all romance novels like that?

84
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,090
That's the problem!

85
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,690
Romance novels used to be so grand and comforted the hearts of countless youths,

86
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,010
but now it has become like this.

87
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,770
Didn't two rental bookstores close recently?

88
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,670
Yeah, and if business keeps going down,

89
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,070
I don't even know how long a small publishing company like ours can survive.

90
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,830
We're doomed.

91
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,490
This won't do! For romance novels to survive, we must find a new path!

92
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,780
What path?

93
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,650
I haven't found one yet.

94
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,990
My expectations aren't that high.

95
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,130
I'll be happy if this Situ Aoran can just help us get this month's bonus.

96
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,810
Please, please, please, CEO!
(The way they say "please" here is a play on the word "overbearing.")

97
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,070
Want to get a bonus?

98
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,070
Chief Editor Yao.

99
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,760
What's the point of praying?

100
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,630
CSO, Fugui Bank called again this morning.

101
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,950
Fugui Bank?

102
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,930
Yes, the situation with the CSO's Tianliang Hospitality is terrible.

103
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,830
She is already six months behind on loan repayment.

104
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:52,420
Zheng Xiao'en, I heard that another two book rental stores closed recently.

105
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,640
Yes.

106
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,610
But Chuntian has helped us to secure the rights to distribute on Night Dreams.

107
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,000
Night Dreams?

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,070
Chief Editor, it is an online book society that has been rising in popularity recently.

109
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,660
They get a lot of page views!

110
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,900
And recently we've been actively trying to obtain international collaborations

111
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,340
to push our novels out into the world!

112
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,730
They'll be recorded into audiobooks,

113
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,730
drawn as comics,

114
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,870
and even made into movies! There should be good news soon!

115
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,680
That better be the case.

116
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,410
Where's the cover for the new book?

117
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,500
Coming right up!

118
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,670

Can't it be more...

121
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,440
more...

122
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,880
higher quality?

123
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,800
Of course it can be! No problem!

124
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,620
We can edit it again!

125
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,910
That's what you said last week.

126
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,450
Gosh, Chief Editor, this is quite normal, okay?

127
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,310
And if we edit it more, it'll be better and better. Isn't that right?

128
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,090
That's right, the more it's edited, the better!

129
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,590
Three days.

130
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,000
I want to see the final version.

131
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,950
No problem.

132
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,500
No problem.

133
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,910
Did I hear him correctly? Did he say three days?

134
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,860
You didn't hear it wrong. He said three days.

135
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,220
Three days. How is that possible?

136
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,680
Does he think everyone in the whole world has as much free time as he does?

137
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,200
Hey, say it louder! I'm afraid Butthead Yao didn't hear you clearly enough.

138
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,790
How much money does he think the publishing company pays designers? So many demands!

139
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,650
If we continue like this, I'm afraid no one will take my cases anymore.

140
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,380
No worries. If no one takes them, it'll be up to you.

141
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,930
There will always be a way.

142
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,760
Me again?

143
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,580
I already doubled up as an editor and a fan page editor. Then I became a fan page editor plus art editor.

144
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,000
Now I even have to design the covers?

145
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,690
Capable people get overworked.

146
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,500
This is typical for corporate slaves, unless you own a gold mine.

147
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,600
No.

148
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Then just obediently accept your fate.

There are thousands of overbearing CEOs in the world.

You can decide how to deal with it.

Just one word. Handsome!

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,280
It purifies the body and mind!

162
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,540
It relieves stress and is therapeutic!

163
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,970
- Why am I not his employee?
- Why am I not his employee?

164
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,160
These are the reports for this period.

165
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,310
This cover is not okay. It needs to be higher quality.

166
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,040
Higher quality? What do you mean? I don't understand.

167
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,840
CEO, can you teach me?

168
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,410
Please. I want to be taught in an up close and personal manner.

169
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,780
Hey, stop it!

170
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,790
If he really was our boss,

171
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,780
we probably wouldn't be interested in him.

172
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,630
That might not be true.

173
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,890
Look, I bet you this colleague has a secret crush on him.

174
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,860
Really?

175
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,320
I think he's leaving.

176
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,990
No, no, no! Don't be so cruel!

177
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,190
Come back! Come ba—

178
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,100
Okay, bring it back.

179
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,430
Things really aren't going well today.

180
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,700
We couldn't even watch for five minutes.

181
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,880
Forget it. We should go back and finish the cover for the new book.

182
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,210
There are only 2 days and 23 hours left!

183
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,420
Hurry!

184
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,570
My father must have asked for me because of Tianliang Hospitality, right?

185
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,350
Yes.

186
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,300
I, He Tianxing, am just a brick.

187
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm moved to wherever I'm needed.

188
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,530
Why is my dad looking for me all of a sudden?

189
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,950
Did someone run and tattle to him?

190
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,520
I think it's because Fugui Bank couldn't get a hold of you, so they went to see the chairman.

191
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,060
Then it's your problem.

192
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,540
How in the world do you handle your work?

193
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,130
Yes, sorry. I didn't handle things well.

194
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,610
What about the new financial plan?

195
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,470
It's ready.

196
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,770
Yes.

197
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,990
Dad, you were looking for me?

198
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,750
Miss.

199
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,310
Speak.

200
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,910
What is the problem with Tianliang Hospitality?

201
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,450
Didn't you already get financing from the bank twice?

202
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,100
Why are there still problems?

203
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,330
There are absolutely no problems.

204
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,620
Our company's growth potential is great.

205
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,480
It's just that we're still in the starting stages,

206
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,170
so that's why we're not able to show much progress in such a short period of time.

207
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,800
Is this an excuse?

208
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,310
Who starts a company, and after three years,

209
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,720
is still in the starting stages?

210
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,030
How much longer does this need to go on for?

211
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,260
Dad, this is our newest financial plan. Please take a look.

212
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,390
If we follow the plan, we'll start to make money in a year, at most.

213
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,010
We're on the last mile now.

214
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,420
If we withdraw now, then we'll really lose everything we invested.

215
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,290
You want Tianliang Construction to acquire Tianliang Hospitality stock again?

216
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,150
This is clearly drawing my money for your account!

217
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,940
Tianxing, look at this.

218
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,770
No, this won't work.

219
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,220
What Tianliang Hospitality will make in a year does not even make up one-tenth of the overall loss.

220
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,550
Furthermore, there are other subsidiaries that have helped and made cross-fund investments.

221
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,450
This has dragged down Tianliang Construction and Tianliang Group's other assets.

222
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,690
Are you deliberately trying to find ways to ruin my company?

223
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,620
The person ruining Tianliang Hospitality is you not me.

224
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,180
It's my company. It's not your place to criticize and give orders!

225
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,930
Enough!

226
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,510
Sorry, sorry, I'm late.

227
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,750
I just ran over here. I'm so thirsty.

228
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,780
- Bro.
- What?

229
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,600
Where were you guys? Continue, continue! You can ignore me.

230
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,870
We were just talking about

231
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,880
whether we should increase our equity stake in Miss's Tianliang Hospitality.

232
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,470
Okay, so what's the conclusion?

233
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,640
CEO thinks we should shut the business down,

234
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,840
but Miss is against that.

235
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,620
If Tianxing thinks we should shut it down, then just shut it down.

236
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,590
It's not like any of the businesses my sister starts ever makes money anyway.

237
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,820
Shut it down.

238
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,340
He Tianjian, don't live off me and help the outsider.

239
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,980
But it's the truth!

240
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,260
Who's the insider and who's the outsider?

241
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,470
Aren't you all my children with my last name?

242
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,620
Why are you differentiating insiders and outsiders?

243
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,200
I'm still alive,

244
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,240
and you're splitting my family right in front of me?

245
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,270
Then should I just die now?

246
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,060
We'll do as Tianxing said regarding this matter. No more nonsense.

247
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,130
Dad!

248
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,240
I have other things to attend to. Meeting adjourned!

249
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,960
Chairman, are you okay?

250
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,730
Yes.

251
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,020
Mingli, this child...

252
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,990
She has the ambition,

253
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,840
but her personality is too hasty, and she cares too much about appearances.

254
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,180
If it weren't for Tianxing helping to watch over everything,

255
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,990
something bad will happen sooner or later.

256
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,930
Chairman, don't you often say that

257
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,500
of your three children, Tianxing is the most like you?

258
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,620
As long as the company has him, everything will be okay.

259
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,050
This is true.

260
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,150
It's thanks to him.

261
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,470
Chaoqin, in the future, you need to help watch over Tianxing.

262
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,290
He's still young.

263
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,710
Although he's very capable,

264
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,330
he still needs someone to help him.

265
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,520
Chairman, don't say that.

266
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,910
This is my duty.

267
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,120
Chairman, what's wrong? Chairman, are you okay?

268
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,140
Chairman! Chairman! Chairman!

269
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,110
Someone come help! Quick!

270
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,070
Chairman!

271
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,550
[Operation Room]

272
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,010
Mom, we need to have faith in Dad. We've already got the best medical team.

273
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,320
Dad will be fine.

274
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,470
Don't worry.

275
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,760
- Mom!
- Sis!

276
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,040
Mingli, you're finally here.

277
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,510
I am so scared. Your dad...

278
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,810
What would I do if something happens to your dad?

279
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,720
Mom, it's okay, I'm here.

280
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,580
How's Dad's condition?

281
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,950
He had a heart attack and is inside undergoing an emergency operation.

282
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,850
Why all of a sudden? Wasn't he just fine?

283
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,210
It's my fault for not taking good care of the chairman. It's my fault.

284
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,610
Uncle Hu, we can't blame you for this.

285
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,210
Tianxing!

286
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,390
Who told him to come?

287
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,080
Was it you?

288
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,830
I told Tianxing to come.

289
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,570
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

290
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,510
How's my dad's condition?

291
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,690
We just finished surgery, but his condition is not stable.

292
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,320
We need to keep observing him.

293
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,010
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

294
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,750
Nothing can happen to you.

295
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,720
Otherwise, what would I do?

296
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,360
Really.

297
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,240
Chairman! Chairman, what is it?

298
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,800
Tian?

299
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,780
You want Tianxing, right? Wait, wait!

300
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,030
Hey! Tianxing, Tianxing! Quick! The chairman is looking for you!

301
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,850
Dad!

302
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,120
Dad, I'm right here.

303
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,470
Dad, are you okay?

304
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,430
Dad... Dad.

305
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,650
No way.

306
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,920
Chuntian, tell me what date it is today.

307
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,620
It's the 25th.

308
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,800
There are still ten days before my next paycheck.

309
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I only have NT$800 (~US$26) for these ten days.

310
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,170
Because the balance is less than NT$1000, this ATM wouldn't let me withdraw!

311
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,500
Am I supposed to eat dirt?

312
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,000
Hey, Zheng Xiao'en!

313
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,590
Don't provoke someone who has to eat dirt.

314
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,080
Rather than eat my food, why don't you just find an ATM that gives out NT$100 bills?

315
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,150
Towards the end of every month, I always have to eat dirt.

316
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,950
How can I keep living like this?

317
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,020
God, please give me an overbearing CEO!

318
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,620
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Ah!

319
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,480
Would it cost me my life for that to happen?

320
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,310
Hey! Do you know how to drive? Do you drive without looking?

321
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,710
So nonsensical!

[CEO Lecture]

323
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,780
[Heir of the Century He Tianxing]

324
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,940
Is wanting a CEO asking for too much?

325
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,990
Just go to sleep. Anything can happen in a dream.

326
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
The more I think about it, the more I can't accept it!

327
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,420
How can Dad be like this! All he thinks about is Tianxing!

328
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,030
Are we not his biological children?

329
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,380
Zhaonan, nothing can happen to you!

330
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,220
Mom!

331
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,150
Pull yourself together!

332
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,770
You only know how to cry!

333
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,730
Mom, it's okay... it's okay.

334
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,330
Sis, why are you taking it out on Mom?

335
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,020
Did I say anything wrong?

336
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,270
If she wasn't so useless,

337
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,950
would He Tianxing even have a chance of being the boss?

338
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,590
Great, just great. Now, Dad has collapsed.

339
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:11,650
Next, He Tianxing is definitely going to kick the three of us out of Tianliang Group.

340
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,310
Why would Tianxing do that?

341
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,880
He Tianjian!

342
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,850
Are you really this idiotic or just pretending to be naive?

343
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,670
Have you forgotten what we've done to him?

344
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,700
You're a pacifist.

345
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,050
He Tianxing is not!

346
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,100
He's basically a vulture.

347
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,210
He's a vampire.

348
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,680
All these years, he was just waiting for a chance.

349
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,320
I...

350
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,810
I don't think Tianxing would do that.

351
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,580
Did you know that in Dad's will

352
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,060
it is clearly written that the entire Tianliang Group will be left with He Tianxing?

353
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,440
If something bad really happens to Dad...

354
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,450
When that moment comes, no one can stop him.

355
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,260
Zhaonan!

356
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,960
Zhaonan!

357
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,750
Where did you hear that from?

358
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,270
It's not important where I heard that from.

359
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,080
The point is,

360
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,590
we can't just sit and await our deaths.

361
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,110
Dad!

362
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,370
Dad, I'm right here.

363
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,600
Dad... Dad.

364
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,830
Tianxing, we just received notice

365
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,110
that He Mingli will call an ad hoc board meeting tomorrow.

366
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,220
She's that impatient?

367
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,720
The chairman collapsed.

368
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,000
They want to use this opportunity to elect a new chairman.

369
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,020
It's not that unexpected.

370
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,450
Are you confident?

371
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,950
Of the nine members on the board of directors, how many can you get on your side?

372
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,670
My dad just collapsed.

373
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,560
He's still in the intensive care unit.

374
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,430
Must we be discussing this now?

375
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,880
Tianxing, I understand how you feel,

376
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,070
but you really can't afford to be sad.

377
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,980
He Mingli will definitely make a move tomorrow.

378
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,980
There's no way He Mingli will vote for me.

379
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,530
Tianjian...

380
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,050
I'm not sure.

381
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,020
Myself, Uncle Hu,

382
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,280
and those who I'm close to, Director Sun,

383
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,510
Director Xu, and Director Zhang.

384
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,840
I should be able to get five votes.

385
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,540
Okay, I understand.

386
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,040
Go home early and get some rest.

387
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,670
You'll have a tough battle to fight tomorrow.

388
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,050
Alright.

389
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,950
Just past 4 AM.

390
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,570
Let me sleep!

391
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,990
It must be because of the cover design that I can't sleep.

392
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,130
Dearest Lucas, I'm sorry for bothering at this time.

393
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,920
I wanted to ask about the progress of the cover design.

394
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Is there anything I can help you with?

395
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,090
What are you rushing me for! It's almost done!

396
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,570
Really? That's great! You've worked hard.

397
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,530
If you want to eat or drink something, I'll send it to you right away!

398
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,210
Thank you!

399
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,560
Sis.

400
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,640
You still won't use your vote for me?

401
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,290
Tianxing has always been doing well.

402
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,750
Every year, we earn a decent profit.

403
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,670
What's wrong with the win-win situation we have currently?

404
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,340
That's enough.

405
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,050
It's fine if you don't vote for me,

406
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,260
but don't drag me down with you.

407
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,200
At the very least, don't vote for He Tianxing.

408
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,110
- Sis.
- Shut up.

409
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,270
Everyone, today we are here to hold an ad hoc board meeting.

410
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,820
Other than the board members, everyone else please leave.

411
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,980
Good luck. I will notify you if there's any news.

412
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,470
Is everything ready?

413
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,000
You came.

414
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,360
I'm so tired!

415
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,000
At 4:30 AM, the designer told me it was almost done.

416
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,790
It turns out that when I arrived, nothing was done!

417
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,730
I had to watch him until now to barely get these three covers.

418
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,000
You don't need to watch. The handsome guy hasn't come to work yet.

419
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,940
Hey! There's clearly more in the office drawer!

420
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,560
Why can't you get one yourself! You always take mine!

421
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,350
Snacks only taste good when you share it!

422
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,920
Have you not heard of the half bag theory?

423
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,030
What half bag theory?

424
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,630
A bag is most delicious when it is half full.

425
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,100
With no one to share it with, even the most tasty snacks

426
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,930
will become tasteless.

427
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,580
Wow, that's great! Just to steal snacks, you spout so much nonsense.

428
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,570
You're wasting your talent by being an editor.

429
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,430
Why hasn't the handsome guy come to work yet?

430
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,200
CEOs have it better.

431
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,480
Unlike us, they can go to work whenever they want.

432
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:07,070
These three covers won't do.

433
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,410
Chief Editor will definitely explode.

434
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,150
How good could it be if he rushed to finish it in one night?

435
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,650
This is already the limit.

436
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,010
Why is it that when I most need to purify my body and mind,

437
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,500
the handsome guy hasn't come to work!

438
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,720
My condolences.

439
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,300
I really don't want to go back to the office.

440
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,160
The designer said this was the final draft.

441
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,900
He won't change it anymore.

442
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,590
What are you laughing at?

443
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,000
This is the scene in  CEO, You're So Naughty  where the main male and female leads meet unexpectedly.

444
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,690
In order to return the injured chick to its nest, the gentle and kindhearted girl

445
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,890
climbed up the tree full of blossoms

446
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,970
despite of her fear of heights.

447
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,130
The female lead is really extraordinarily honorable.

448
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,400
She's climbing a tree and specifically chose one that's full of blooming flowers.

449
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,090
And then what happens?

450
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,410
And then... of course she slipped and fell down the tree.

451
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,730
And then the male lead spins her 360 degrees and catches her in his arms.

452
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,000
Their eyes meet.

453
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,280
Suddenly, it was as if they were the only ones left in the entire universe.

454
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,550
They could only hear each other's heartbeat and breath.

455
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:48,480
And this is just a preview of a passionate romance.

456
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,020
Okay, it's pretty dreamy.

457
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,850
Oh, please! She's falling from a tree!

458
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,150
It's already a miracle the male lead wasn't crushed to death.

459
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,320
And he was able to find the precise position to catch her right in his arms.

460
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,190
Hey, this is really a miracle!

461
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,710
Let me tell you, this guy being a CEO is a waste of human talent.

462
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,010
He should be a monk,

463
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:15,990
and witness a miraculous moment. Magic~

464
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,610
It's a miracle when it comes to us, okay?

465
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:22,850
The female leads of novels must be as light as a feather.

466
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,000
Sure enough, this only happens in the world of a novel.

467
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,290
My egg, cheese, and pork sung sandwich is here!

468
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,410
I'm going to get it. Otherwise it'll be stolen.

469
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,930
Hey, eat this for me first. I'll come back later.

470
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,370
Hey! If the handsome CEO comes to work, remember to call me!

471
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,120
Okay.

472
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,330
Please raise your hand if you oppose.

473
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,430
Please put your hands down. Thank you.

474
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:07,720
So for the development proposal, there are six votes in favor and two in opposition.

475
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,400
If there are no other problems,

476
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,930
then the development proposal will progress in accordance with the voting results.

477
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,780
Do you have any other opinions?

478
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,140
None?

479
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,610
Are there any last minute motions? If there's none, then—

480
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,680
I have something to say.

481
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,290
I believe that all of you here know

482
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,580
that my father, Chairman He,

483
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,670
had to receive emergency hospital treatment yesterday because of a heart attack.

484
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,980
Even though the surgery was very successful,

485
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,430
the post-operation recovery process will be very long.

486
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,000
No one can be sure whether he will be able to completely recover.

487
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,490
As a result,

488
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,890
for the sake of the company's operations,

489
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,260
I propose

490
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,390
that we elect a new chairman.

491
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,040
Selecting a new chairman is a serious matter.

492
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,450
I suggest we take a ten minute break

493
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,120
to give everyone a chance to prepare. Is that okay?

494
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm okay with that.

495
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,330
Tianxing?

496
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,990
No problem.

497
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,200
Okay, then let's take a ten minute break.

498
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,480
I'm going to smoke.

499
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,490
Where are you going?

500
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,010
The bathroom. Do you want to come with me?

501
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,670
What's going on?

502
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,160
Hey! Is anyone out there?

503
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,560
I can't open the door to the men's bathroom. Is anyone there?

504
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,700
Yoohoo!

505
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,680
Are you kidding me?

506
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,420
Of all times, why do you have to be broken now?

507
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,290
What is management doing?

508
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,790
Young Master, sorry. It's Miss who wanted me to do this.

509
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,060
What do you mean?

510
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,360
Sorry, you just have to stay in there for ten minutes and then you can come out.

511
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,710
He Mingli, isn't this excessive?

512
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,970
[Tianjian]

513
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,410
It's about time.

514
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,540
He Mingli, what are you doing?

515
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,080
Electing the new chairman. Were you not here?

516
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,300
Director Xu and Tianjian haven't come back. Not everyone's here.

517
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,090
So what?

518
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,590
We agreed on a ten minute break.

519
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,270
They gave up their right to vote themselves.

520
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,750
Besides, according to the bylaws,

521
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,730
as long as two-thirds of the members are present, there can be a vote.

522
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,910
It's 1:48 PM right now.

523
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,180
We now start the election of Tianliang Group's chairman.

524
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,650
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

525
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:18,930
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

526
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:26,000
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

527
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,980
It's 1:48 PM right now.

528
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,540
We now start the election of Tianliang Group's chairman.

529
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,950
How can something like this happen?

530
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,380
Okay.

531
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,150
What right do you have to not let me go upstairs?

532
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,860
Director Xu, they've already started the vote for a new chairman.

533
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,480
Right now, those who approve of me, He Mingli, becoming the chairwoman,

534
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,600
please raise your hand.

535
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,410
Uncle Hu?

536
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,030
Why?

537
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,530
Tianxing,

538
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,280
I'm sorry.

539
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,290
Four to three.

540
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:57,070
I announce that Tianliang Group's new chairwoman

541
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:00,980
is me, He Mingli.

542
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,750
Congratulations.

543
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,270
I hope you can sincerely take the company's best interests to heart

544
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,640
and lead the company to the next level.

545
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,020
And this is?

546
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,460
Dad's will is with you, right?

547
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,440
Why are you asking this?

548
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,220
Nothing. I'm just curious.

549
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,100
What? I can't take a look?

550
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,930
He Mingli, Dad's still alive.

551
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,940
Hey!

552
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,910
Be careful!

553
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,100
Hey!

554
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,240
- He ran that way.
- Stop running!

555
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,250
Stop running!

556
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,770
- Stop running!
- He's here!

557
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,570
Hurry!

558
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,220
♫ Lost to you ♫

559
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,360
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

560
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,830
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

561
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:39,840
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

562
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:46,210
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

563
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,970
- Stop running!
- He's here!

564
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,610
Come with me.

565
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,300
Just wait here. Someone will come get you.

566
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,790
Thanks.

567
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,310
There probably won't be any easy days ahead for you.

568
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,600
Take care of yourself.

569
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:43,020
He Tianjian.

570
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,240
Sis.

571
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,900
Come here.

572
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,740
What exactly do you still want to do?

573
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,640
It's none of your business. Hurry over here!

574
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,930
Haven't you already become the chairwoman?

575
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:56,170
Can't you just let Tianxing go?

576
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,330
He Tianxing, I don't know what you told Tianjian,

577
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:04,510
but please don't be so shameless and only know to hide behind my brother.

578
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,630
I understand.

579
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,080
You've been like this since you were young.

580
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,540
Your heart is loftier than the sky,

581
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,370
but too bad your life is thinner than paper.

582
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,040
The chairman position was snatched, so you're angry

583
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,480
and you don't want to give me the will.

584
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,010
I understand all that, but...

585
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,630
you have to find a way to stay alive first.

586
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,630
He Mingli, do you know what you're saying?

587
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,120
He Tianjian, that's enough!

588
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,020
My patience is limited.

589
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,870
If you don't come over here, then I'll have to treat you in the same way.

590
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,730
One.

591
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,470
Two.

592
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,160
Forget it.

593
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,400
Tianjian, you've already done enough for me.

594
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,650
Go.

595
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,660
How can I do that?

596
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,220
Three!

597
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,210
Let go of me! Let go of me!

598
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,370
He Mingli.

599
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,650
What you want is this, right?

600
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,300
How am I supposed to know if that's real or fake?

601
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,840
You'll know once you read it.

602
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,710
No, no, no.

603
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,160
For something so important, I think it's best if you come here personally.

604
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,490
Why should I listen to you?

605
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,430
Because you have no choice.

606
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,540
There is only one chance.

607
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,680
Whether you're willing to take the bet is up to you.

608
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,960
If that's the real will, would you really be okay with throwing it away?

609
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,840
Why would I not be okay with it?

610
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,950
I've already seen the contents.

611
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,150
Moreover, Dad's still alive.

612
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,790
I can always find a lawyer to redraft a few copies,

613
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,720
But it's not the same for you.

614
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,080
Didn't you do all this stuff just to get a peek at it?

615
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,680
How about it?

616
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,740
You're really curious, right?

617
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,070
What does Dad's will say?

618
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,230
What will I get?

619
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,140
What will be given to you?

620
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,570
Whether you want it is up to you.

621
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,190
Fine, I'll come!

622
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,460
Chairwoman!

623
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,980
Stand still!

624
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,200
The moment I relax my hand,

625
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,280
the person who will be thrown off the building is you.

626
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,720
You think you'll be able to walk out of here after throwing me off the building?

627
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,000
If I don't throw you off the building,

628
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,560
can I really walk out of here alive?

629
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,410
Since I'll die either way,

630
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,960
by having you as a companion on the road to the afterworld,

631
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,200
at least it won't be boring!

632
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,550
Tianxing!

633
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,900
Calm down.

634
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,740
Out of respect for me, why don't you let go of Mingli?

635
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,880
Tianjian, it's not that I won't let her off the hook today.

636
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,480
It's that she won't leave me alone!

637
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,150
He Tianjian, shut your mouth! Don't beg him!

638
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,650
You've been tricked.

639
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,060
He's not as simple as he looks on the surface.

640
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,570
Begging him is useless.

641
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,730
Sis, please, just forget it, okay?

642
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,230
Just let Tianxing off the hook.

643
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,140
You don't need to joke with your life, right?

644
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,100
No way!

645
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,600
I will not lower my head to this guy!

646
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,110
Qiaozhi!

647
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,860
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

648
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:02,850
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

649
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:09,310
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

650
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,220
Since I'll die either way,

651
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,790
by having you as a companion on the road to the afterworld,

652
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,010
at least it won't be boring!

653
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,480
Tianxing!

654
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,740
Calm down.

655
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,630
Out of respect for me, why don't you let go of Mingli?

656
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:30,710
Tianjian, it's not that I won't let her off the hook today.

657
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,290
It's that she won't leave me alone!

658
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,030
He Tianjian, shut your mouth! Don't beg him!

659
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,520
You've been tricked.

660
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,920
He's not as simple as he looks on the surface.

661
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,360
Begging him is useless.

662
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,620
Sis, please, just forget it, okay?

663
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,070
Just let Tianxing off the hook.

664
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,030
You don't need to joke with your life, right?

665
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,970
No way!

666
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:53,410
I will not lower my head to this guy!

667
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,010
Qiaozhi!

668
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,230
How could this happen?

669
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,140
How could this happen?

670
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,220
Call the police.

671
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,970
Call the police.

672
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,010
Even the CEO was met with such mishap...

673
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,830
If someone as unimportant as me gets found out,

674
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,670
I'll be dead meat.

675
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,770
Hey! What are you doing?!

676
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,740
Where's my drone?

677
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,320
Oh...

678
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,980
There was an eagle that flew by, and it attacked our drone...

679
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,930
An eagle? Where would there be an eagle?

680
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:41,090
What are you doing?

681
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,460
I don't feel good.

682
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,520
Are you okay? You really don't look good.

683
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,310
Help me tell Chief Editor that I want to take the day off.

684
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,970
Okay, let's go back. I'll tell him.

685
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,980
Hey, be careful.

686
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,600
There was a sudden report this afternoon that Tianliang Group CEO He Tianxing accidentally fell from a building.

687
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,040
Chairman He Zhaonan suddenly underwent emergency surgery yesterday,

688
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,780
and today, CEO He Tianxing for some reason lost his footing and fell from a building.

689
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,120
He didn't die?

690
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,040
That's right. They're still trying to save him.

691
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,540
Go and watch him.

692
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,510
If there's any news, let me know immediately.

693
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,930
Yes.

694
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,760
Whose drone was that?

695
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,980
I'm still looking.

696
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,750
You better keep a closer eye.

697
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,050
Think of a way to get rid of all security cameras that might have recorded it.

698
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:29,770
Got it.

699
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,880
Even though they're still trying to save him,

700
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,910
to have fallen from such a high altitude,

701
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,630
He Tianxing is probably going to die.

702
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,120
Uncle Hu, congratulations.

703
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,210
This time, you picked the right side.

704
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,340
The most important thing in life really is opportunity.

705
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,710
Where should we go to celebrate later?

706
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,660
Celebrate what?

707
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,010
I've become the chairwoman.

708
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,280
Shouldn't we celebrate?

709
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,920
I'm leaving.

710
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,760
Where are you going?

711
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,190
You're always so strange.

712
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,760
Later, let's go together.

713
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:34,080
Of course.

714
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,430
You are...

715
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,310
from the Secretary's Office?

716
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,560
My name is Ling Chuchu.

717
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,520
Okay. Who are you looking for?

718
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,590
Are you okay?

719
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,610
CEO...

720
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,670
is he okay?

721
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,040
Tianxing's injuries are severe.

722
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,960
I believe he'll be okay.

723
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:43,020
I believe he'll recover.

724
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:51,540
This afternoon, Tianliang Group CEO He Tianxing suddenly fell from a building.

725
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,300
After life-saving measures, he has been temporarily put in the intensive care unit for continued monitoring.

726
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,580
As for the reason for the fall, initial investigation indicates an accident.

727
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,230
More details will be revealed after the police investigates further.

728
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,410
He Tianxing turned 32 this year.

729
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:07,460
He graduated from Stanford's Graduate School of Business

730
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,270
and worked his way up from entry level at Tianliang Group.

731
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:13,020
Two years ago, he became CEO.

732
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,720
Why is the news saying that it was an accident?

733
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,560
It clearly wasn't from what I saw.

734
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,890
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

735
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:41,840
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

736
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:48,440
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

737
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,120
Why is the news saying that it was an accident?

738
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,110
It clearly wasn't from what I saw.

739
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,390
Sure enough, the waters are deep in these big corporations.

740
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,920
They can make a person disappear so easily.

741
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,990
Good thing I didn't report it to the police, or else...

742
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,310
At any rate, he's been saved.

743
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:11,930
There's hope as long as he's still alive.

744
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:18,030
I will definitely pray for you and light lanterns at the temple for your speedy recovery.

745
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,020
I should shower and go to bed.

746
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,650
Good morning.

747
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,830
Strange.

748
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,830
Why isn't Butthead Yao pressing us about the cover today?

749
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,230
Zheng Xiao'en.

750
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,850
Whoa, what's wrong?

751
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,420
I didn't sleep well last night.

752
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,330
I had a nightmare all night.

753
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,330
Why is that?

754
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:08,060
Are you still not feeling well?

755
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,680
Did you go see the doctor?

756
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,020
I have no energy.

757
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:14,580
This won't do.

758
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,330
But did you know that the handsome CEO next door fell from a building yesterday?

759
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:28,170
I did see the news.

760
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,480
How could something like this happen?

761
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,730
He's so young and handsome.

762
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:37,120
How could he get into an accident just like that?

763
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,430
It's so pitiful.

764
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,410
What are you doing?

765
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,060
Nothing.

766
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,660
Come, come. Each of you, draw one.

767
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,160
What's this?

768
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,000
Don't ask. Just draw one.

769
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,520
Congratulations!

770
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,820
I won the prize?

771
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,680
Congratulations, you won the grand prize.

772
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,070
You have been awarded the right to visit Chief Editor Yao at the hospital.

773
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,230
Yesterday Chief Editor Yao had a hemorrhoid flare-up,

774
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,800
and he went to the hospital for a surgery.

775
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,100
Congratulations, you are our department's representative.

776
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,640
Remember to send my regards to the chief editor.

777
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:29,660
Oh, right. This is the get-well card everyone signed for Chief Editor Yao.

778
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,350
Both of you, remember to sign your names as well.

779
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,000
Don't forget.

780
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,020
I'm so unlucky.

781
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,550
I shouldn't just light lanterns for other people.

782
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,890
I need to do it for myself too.

783
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,200
Whom are you lighting a lantern for?

784
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,320
You.

785
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,810
Nonsense! I'm not that unlucky, okay?

786
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:59,180
Enough, stop being so sad. Come, give me a smile.

787
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,680
Look, this might be God's will.

788
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,200
You're not feeling well, yet you're too lazy to go to the hospital.

789
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,360
So you're being sent to visit a patient so that you can also conveniently see a doctor.

790
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,280
Isn't He so thoughtful?

791
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,420
Okay!

792
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:17,920
Okay, hurry up and see a doctor; then go home and rest.

793
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,580
Oh, this too. Sign it for me too.

794
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,130
I won't send you off now. Bye!

795
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,020
The police told me it was an accident,

796
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,290
but I don't believe it.

797
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:02,960
Tianxing, tell me, who made you like this?

798
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,520
What exactly happened yesterday?

799
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:24,090
I've known you since college.

800
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:27,020
You're not the kind of person who would ever admit defeat.

801
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:30,990
I know you're very tired, but you really can't rest now.

802
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:33,580
The enemy hasn't collapsed yet.

803
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,980
Do you need something?

804
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,800
Tianxing is still unconscious.

805
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,100
No matter what you need, please wait until he wakes up.

806
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:01,430
Do you think he'll wake up?

807
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,890
What do you mean?

808
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,810
Not much.

809
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:10,280
It's just that we've already arranged for the best doctor at the best hospital to treat him,

810
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,810
so I came to help him with the transfer.

811
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,420
What? You guys can't.

812
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,910
Why not?

813
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:23,150
I'm his family member. Only I can decide where he goes.

814
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:28,770
Doctor, how can he transfer hospitals at this time?

815
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,710
If the family members insist, we can't prevent it.

816
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,280
Shouldn't a doctor act in his patient's best interests?

817
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:38,230
Yes, that's why we've made arrangements with a hospital hired by the He Family,

818
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:42,180
complete with a VIP medical ward and the best medical team.

819
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:46,840
This is of course in the patient's best interests.

820
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,380
Doctor, please save Tianxing!

821
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,250
He really can't be taken away!

822
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,720
Miss, please calm down.

823
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,940
Miss He is the patient's family.

824
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,480
She will definitely make sure Mr. He gets treated.

825
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,880
Doctor, you don't understand!

826
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,770
Tianxing really can't be handed over to her!

827
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,420
Miss, please don't meddle!

828
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,540
If you tamper with the patient's life-support system, it will be more dangerous.

829
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:09,400
Move aside! You can't do this!

830
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,170
What are you doing?

831
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:14,180
Let go of me!

832
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,300
Don't touch Tianxing!

833
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,600
Royal Group?

834
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,990
[Marketing Department, Zheng Xiao'en]
How could I not know that our company changed its name?

835
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,210
Don't I work at a publishing company?

836
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,270
Why is everything different after waking up?

837
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:29,530
He Tianxing! You're okay now?

838
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,330
It's so great to see that you've recovered!

839
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:35,520
Woman, you're in this building, but you don't know who I am?

840
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,860
Zheng Xiao'en, you don't know Situ Aoran?

841
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,360
Situ Aoran!

842
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,780
CEO, You're So Naughty?

843
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:45,660
♫ We've got nothing but time ♫

844
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:51,430
♫ If only I could have insomnia ♫

845
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,520
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

846
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,590
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

847
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:08,390
♫ A quiet strike ♫

848
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:13,370
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

849
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,470
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

850
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,590
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

851
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:23,060
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

852
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,650
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

853
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,840
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

854
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:35,870
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

855
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:40,550
♫ If I could see you again ♫

856
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:47,200
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

857
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,390
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

858
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:59,540
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

859
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:04,400
♫ If you were a painter ♫

860
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,370
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

861
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:10,600
♫ No regrets ♫

862
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:16,370
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
