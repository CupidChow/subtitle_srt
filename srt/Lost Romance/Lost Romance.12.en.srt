You support me on the surface, but you seduce him behind my back.

You purposely sent the others away so that you could take a photo with the CEO, right?

I really wasn't supporting you on the surface and pulling dirty tricks behind your back. I was—

I don't need your explanation.

Zheng Xiao'en hit someone?

48
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,110
It's okay. First, explain what happened clearly.

49
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,900
I also don’t know what happened.

50
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,290
Xiao’en said she has been busy for a couple of days.

51
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,250
Since no one was watching anyway, she asked me to come over and tidy up.

52
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,020
After I came, Xiao'en got mad at me and asked why I was so slow.

53
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,730
I wanted to explain, but Xiao'en wouldn't listen.

54
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,200
She forcefully pushed me.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,930
- She only knows how to do superficial work.
- What goes around comes around.

56
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,740
- I could see that she's so fake.
- She's so two-faced.

57
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,100
She just wants to show off in front of senior executives.

58
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,120
Xiao'en isn't that type of person.

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,450
Is there some sort of misunderstanding?

60
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,210
If the CEO says it's a misunderstanding, then I guess it's a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,440
No matter what the situation was, is it right to hit people?

62

You’ve become so arrogant now.

Hey! You're all so weird.

64
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,170
In the past, did you ever support Chuchu like this?

65
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,920
And did you personally see what happened?

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,600
- It hurts.
- Apologize! Apologize! Apologize!

Hurry and apologize!

Xiao'en, why don't you apologize to Chuchu and we will drop this issue?

71
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,000
You want me to apologize.

That's not what I mean.

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,170
Shouldn't the person who hit someone apologize?

75
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,380
Now that you have the CEO looking out for you, are you just acting arrogantly?

76
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,010
- Hurry and apologize!
- Apologize! Hurry and apologize!

77
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,270
Xiao'en.

78
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm sorry!

79
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,920
- Xiao'en!
- I'll go!

80
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,620
- She has the CEO as her support.
- She’s not even putting on an act anymore.

81
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,900
She’s publicly hitting people.

82
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,250
The CEO even ran out in a hurry.

83
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,970
Is he afraid that she will be hit by a car?

84
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,030
Hey! Watch what you say!

85
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,210
Did I say something wrong?

86
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,630
People like Zheng Xiao’en actually has guards.

87
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,590
You’re the one who will be hit by a car! Your whole family will be hit by cars!

88
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,890
Enough! Enough! It’s dangerous to anger this mass of people. Tolerate them first.

89
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,820
There must be some sort of misunderstanding.

90
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,470
Everyone calm down first. Don’t be so angry.

91
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,240
I really don’t know what I did wrong.

92
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,700
Why did Xiao’en get so angry?

93
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,200
- She’s really gone too far.
- Are you all right?

94
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,970
Are you okay?

95
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,190
Let's talk.

96
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,990
What happened? Why did you hit Chuchu?

97
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,970
Is it because I liked her before, so you're jealous?

98
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,300
Being jealous is normal, but hitting someone isn't cute.

99
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,050
Shouldn't you apologize?

100
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,670
You think I hit her because I'm jealous?

101
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,990
So in your mind, you actually see me as a really narrow-minded person.

102
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:33,460
Because you're not narrow-minded, I wanted to ask you what happened.

103
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,800
You want to know? Fine, I'll tell you.

104
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,110
Because she's trying to mess with me. She's being shady.

105
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,900
There are many people who want to mess with me.

106
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,890
Every day at work, I have to fight monsters to level up.

107
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,960
Do you think I'm foolish?

108
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,980
Not at all.

109
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,700
Then why am I being stabbed in the back?

110
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,260
It's because I didn't guard against her.

111
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,570
Even though we are rivals in love,

112
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,970
I really gave it my all to help her.

113
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,970
Anyone can mess with me, just not Chuchu!

114
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,540
Some rules of a group are unreasonable.

115
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,690
But in order to survive, you must at least have a basic understanding.

116
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,900
Otherwise, one day you'll become the target.

117
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,210
You won't even know how you died.

118

Your dad's medical fees.

119
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,100
Don't worry, I'll take care of the rest of the fees.

120
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,940
Master, your drink is here.

121
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,050
I'll make it taste good for you now.

122
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,100
- Welcome home, master.
- Hi.

123
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,030
Meow.

124
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,570
If I didn’t slap her, I would've been so angry until my internal organs started hurting.

125
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,580
So you didn't push her?

126
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm a person who is willing to take responsibility for what I do.

127
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,040
If I didn't do it, I didn't.

128
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,710
Then why did she lie?

129
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,670
Go ask her. Don't ask me.

130
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,950
Chuchu doesn't look like someone who would speak carelessly.

131
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,550
She doesn’t look like it, but I do?

132
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,550
That’s not what I meant.

133
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,570
I just feel very shocked. Chuchu wasn’t like this before.

134
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,020
I’m even more shocked than you are.

135

Not only that, I feel very hurt.

136
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,610
What's even more frustrating is that you actually believed such a lousy dirty trick!

When did I ever do that?

140
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,000
You want to say that about me, but aren't you the same?

141
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,690
What did I do this time?

142
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,890
Don’t tell me that you are going to bring up the past

143
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,320
and raise the issue of me and Qingfeng again.

144
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,230
The relationship between me and Supreme Master

145
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,540
is pure, open, and dignified.

146
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,220
It’s fine if you want to talk badly about me.

147
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,440
Given your close relationship with him, doesn’t it hurt your conscience to question him?

148
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,330
I’m not talking about Qingfeng.

149
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,460
If not, who else is there?

150
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,380
He Tianxing!

151
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,090
What’s the relationship between you and He Tianxing?

152
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,720
Actually,

153
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,270
we don’t have much of a relationship.

154
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,150
You like He Tianxing?

155
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,340
It’s not really considered “liking.”

156
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,920
This is a little complicated.

157
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:17,030
I just respect, idolize, look up to, admire, and adore him.

158
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,560
So you respect, idolise, look up to, admire, and adore

159
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,620
a person who has no relationship with you?

160
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,310
Everybody has an idol.

161
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,080
I silently worship him in my heart.

162
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,780
He is a very sacred symbol in my heart.

163
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,400
Zheng Xiao’en.

164
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,970
The question that I’m going to ask next...

165
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,550
you must answer me seriously.

166
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,860
The first time we met, you called me He Tianxing.

167
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,960
After that, you kept mentioning that I look very similar to him.

168
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,610
Zheng Xiao’en, look into my eyes.

169
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,370
Tell me.

170
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,150
Do you actually like me,

171
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,460
or do you like that I look like him?

172
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,770
Look at me!

173
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,890
I'll need some time to answer this question.

174
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,100
I have lots of time.

175
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,660
Actually, I’m not too sure myself.

176
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,390
At first, I thought Situ Aoran was equivalent to He Tianxing.

177
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,610
After that, I felt that it was best if Situ Aoran wasn’t equivalent to He Tianxing.

178
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,050
I hope that you can live happily and not become like He Tianxing.

179
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,030
What if you can only choose one between the two of us?

180
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,030
Can’t I choose both? Both of you are basically from different worlds.

181
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,980
You can’t!

182
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,300
He is him. I am me.

183
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,200
Stop saying that I’m similar to He Tianxing.

184
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,080
I am Situ Aoran!

185
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,980
I’m not a substitute for anyone else.

♫ Sleepwalking the whole world together ♫

187

♫ You don't need to face everything alone ♫

192
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,200
Have you called the police?

193
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,900
Why haven’t you called the police?

194
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,210
Was it really the mafia’s doing, as reported in the magazine,

195
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,320
and that’s why you don’t dare to call the police?

196
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,160
Silly child, the He family has connections with both the police and the mafia.

197
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,210
You don’t have to be scared.

198
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,220
I’m not scared.

199
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,660
Then call the police!

200
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,550
I’ll call the police director-general now.

201
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,630
You can’t.

202
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,680
Why can’t I?

203
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,250
Because... Because it’s... It’s...

204
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,270
It was Sis who hit me.

205
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,350
Has she gone crazy?

206
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,420
He Mingli! Come out!

207
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,320
Mom! Lower your volume.

208
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,230
Sis is probably still sleeping.

209
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,400
Just let her rest.

210
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,710
I heard the doctor say that she has been very stressed recently.

211
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,910
She takes a bunch of sleeping pills, but she still doesn’t sleep well.

212
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,060
I was thinking, is it possible that her chronic insomnia is causing her to run amok?

213
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,850
She always loses her temper for no reason. I think she’s ill.

214
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,740
Mom, wait for me for a while.

215
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,370
Why doesn't she try mine?

216
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,120
This is also a sleeping pill. I think it's pretty effective.

217
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,630
The important thing is that it's a small dosage and it's not addicting.

218
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,730
Why don’t you give this to Sis to try next time?

219
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,970
My baby, you are just so kind.

220
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,850
You were beaten by your sister to this state,

221
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,850
yet you still care about her.

222
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,360
All right, I’ll give this to her to take.

223
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,640
If she sleeps well, she won’t lose her temper all the time.

224
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,490
I also don’t know why she became like this.

225
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,180
Remember, if your sister hits you next time, you must dodge.

226
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,620
- Don’t be so naive, okay?
- Okay.

227
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,780
Mom will feel sorry for you.

228
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,190
What?

229
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,740
You gave the chairwoman pills to take?

230
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,150
That’s right.

231
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,530
Don’t worry.

232
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,060
They’re just sleeping pills with a slightly more potent effect.

233
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,770
At most, there will be some side effects.

234
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,170
Not bad. You’ve improved very quickly.

235
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:26,340
Now, just focus your attention on the board of directors.

236
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,540
No problem.

237
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,910
I’ve been ready for a long time.

238
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,890
You can’t even set up meetings with a few directors?

239
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,800
Are you rubbish?

240
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,770
Continue making phone calls to them!

241
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,330
If they still don’t answer, then send people to block them!

242
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,950
This is such a simple task, yet I still have to teach you?

243
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,630
Rubbish!

244
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,710
Rubbish. Rubbish. Rubbish. Rubbish!

245
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,730
You didn’t leave your room today.

246
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,800
You haven’t even eaten a bite of food. Aren’t you hungry?

247
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,980
I don’t have any appetite.

248
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,940
Are you in a bad mood?

249
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,260
Even if you’re in a bad mood, you shouldn’t hit your brother to vent your anger.

250
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,700
You don’t understand the severity of your actions.

251
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,960
Did mama’s boy come to you looking for sympathy?

252
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,650
That’s right. I was the one who hit him. So what?

253
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,730
Did you come to vent your anger on behalf of your darling son?

254
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,730
I know you are stressed, but you can’t hit other people.

255
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,060
What would you do if you beat your brother to death?

256
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:44,130
If he dies, wouldn't you guys be able to see this nonexistent daughter of yours?

257
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,290
Look at you.

258
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,890
What kind of horrible image are you projecting of yourself now?

259
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,110
Here. This is a new sleeping pill.

260
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,230
After you take it, hurry up and sleep!

261
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,020
You don't resemble a person or a ghost right now.
(Means she looks ghastly and miserable)

262
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,910
Hey! What are you doing?

263
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,060
If you have the guts, why don't you bully the CEO's woman in front of him?

264
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,570
Okay, okay, it's fine!

265
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,570
I have to deal with dirty things this early in the morning.

266
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,550
Xiao'en, are you okay?

267
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,890
I'm fine! This small thing won't hurt or scratch me.

268
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,030
It's good that you have a strong mind.

269
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,340
I think that your days from now on will be even tougher.

270
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,020
I'm not afraid. Who am I? Zheng Xiao'en!

271
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,950
Good morning, CEO. Good morning, CSO.

272
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,870
Good morning, Qingfeng.

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,930
Good morning, Qiutian.

274
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,270
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm taking the stairs.

275
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,860
Huh? Okay, then I'll go with you.

276
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,950
Why are you walking so fast? Wait for me.

277
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,990
- What's wrong?
- Are you two having a cold war?

278
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,990
You didn't resolve it yesterday?

279
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,340
Has Zheng Xiao'en ever talked to you about He Tianxing?

280
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,480
He Tianxing?

281
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,330
Who is he?

282
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,020
Even you don't know?

283
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,780
Looks like Xiao'en is really protective of him.

284
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,590
Protective of whom? He Tianxing?

285
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,310
Who is he?

286
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,710
What's his relationship with Zheng Xiao'en?

287
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,350
If I knew, would I ask you?

288
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,490
Ah, I'm so tired.

289
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,610
Why did I have to hold a grudge against the elevator?

290
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,290
I'm the one who's suffering.

291
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,760
Do I have to play this game with you?

292
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,320
You're finally here.

293
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,970
I was starting to think that everyone agreed to skip work today.

294
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,860
Everyone?

295
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,330
- Chuchu didn't come?
- Yeah.

296
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,930
She won't pick up the phone when I call her.

297
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,660
What's with her now? She's a big shot now?

298
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,390
Is it because Chuchu was slapped by Xiao'en

299
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,030
that she doesn't have the courage to come in to work and see everyone?

300
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,360
Why are you looking at me?

301
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,020
What does it have to do with me?

302
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,630
If she didn't come, then she didn't come.

303
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,020
It's not like I'm in charge of her.

304
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,420
[Printing Room]

305
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,580
Is it because Chuchu was slapped by Xiao'en

306
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,170
that she doesn't have the courage to come in to work and see everyone?

307
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,690
It has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with me.

308
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,220
What? Why are you blocking me?

309
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,820
What? Why are you avoiding me?
("Blocking" sounds like "avoiding")

310
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,990
I'm avoiding to prevent suspicion. Otherwise there will be bad rumors.

311
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,850
People will say I'm two-timing.

312
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,970
Do you feel wrongly accused?

313
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,960
You won't feel wrongly accused if you turn the rumors into reality.

314
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,690
Are you a civil engineer?

315
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,310
Your specialty is digging holes for people to jump into.

316
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,090
You're even smiling.

317
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,480
When I see you, my mood becomes good.

318
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,550
Can't I smile when I'm in a good mood?

319
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,810
Could you not build your happiness on top of my pain?

320
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,510
Where does it hurt?

321
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,940
My head hurts because I've been defamed.

322
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,250
My feet hurt because I climbed up the stairs.

323
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,400
What else?

324
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,750
My heart hurts.

325
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,930
Because you're having a cold war with Aoran.

326
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,080
Did he say bad things behind my back?

327
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,780
He asked me who He Tianxing is.

328
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,750
He's still hung up on that?

329
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,400
So... who is He Tianxing?

330
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,440
It's a bit difficult to explain.

331
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,580
An ex-boyfriend who was in a car accident?

332
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,180
An upperclassman who had an accident in the mountains?

333
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,060
A first love who died from leukemia?

334
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,940
Or a fiancé who disappeared?

335
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,850
- Or—
- No, no, none of those.

336
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,970
It's impossible to explain who he is.

337
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,940
Okay. Then I'll wait until you've figured out how to explain.

338
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,620
Are you and Chuchu okay?

339
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,270
She didn't come to work today.

340
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,600
Actually, last night, I saw Chuchu in Situ Moran's car.

341
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,900
Take this to the marketing department.

342
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,720
Hey, Zheng Xiao'en!

343
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,410
Zheng Xiao'en!

344
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,870
- Chuchu!
- Sister Xiao'en.

345
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,540
- How come you're here?
- Your sister didn't show up for work.

346
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,920
But we left home together this morning.

347
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,130
- Hello?
- I'm Situ Moran.

348
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,680
I've got Chuchu.

349
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,920
What kind of horror place is this?

350
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,110
Chuchu.

351
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,160
Chuchu.

352
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,280
Chuchu.

353
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,880
Chuchu, where are you?

354
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,710
Chuchu.

355
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,570
Chuchu, can you hear me?

356
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,480
Chuchu, where exactly—

357
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,960
Come out!

358
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,170
Come out right now!

359
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,390
What are you doing, Chuchu?

360
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,010
Let me out. Let me out!

361
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,960
How do you want to play the next part? I'll cooperate with you.

362
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,580
I just want to scare Zheng Xiao'en and lock her up for one night

363
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,850
so that she'll stay away from the CEO.

364
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,700
That's it?

365
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,200
That's too boring.

366
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,800
Hey, you—

367
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,570
I'll help you punish Zheng Xiao'en.

368
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,000
How will you repay me?

369
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,920
What do you need me to do?

370
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,250
Call Situ Aoran and tell him that Zheng Xiao'en is here.

371
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,400
No! This has nothing to do with Situ Aoran!

372
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,480
I decide if she can or not!

373
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
I am the boss.

374
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,640
- Hurry up and call him.
- I don't want to.

375
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,890
Okay! Fine.

376
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,260
How about I let Zheng Xiao'en go and instead lock up your father and younger brother?

377
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,220
What do you think about that?

378
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,600
Chuchu, if you really like the CEO,

379
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,940
then don't bring him into this.

380
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,720
- Chuchu!
- You're so noisy!

381
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,660
Hey!

382
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,050
Hello, Chuchu. What's up?

383
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,820
Zheng Xiao'en!

384
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,990
Chuchu!

385
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,000
Zheng Xiao'en, where are you?

386
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,440
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

387
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,440
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

388
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,010
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

389
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,730
Chuchu!

390
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,600
Chuchu, come out. Don't hide.

391
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,990
Come out and deal with this, Chuchu!

392
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,810
Did the CEO come?

393
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,580
He came, but I don't know how long he can stand it.

394
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,090
The warehouse is very dark.

395
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,340
He's afraid of the dark!

396
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,330
Don't cry! Now is not the time to cry!

397
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,970
Hurry up and let me out!

398
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,800
But the key is missing.

399
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,950
What does the lock look like? Let me see.

400
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,020
It's a U-lock.

401
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,130
Go find a stone. A big one.

402
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,230
Hurry up!

403
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,500
I found one. Now what?

404
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,680
As long as you hit the stone against the U-lock to break it open, it will open.

405
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
Do you understand?

406
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,240
Hurry and hit!

407
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

408
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,010
Don't be afraid. Focus and hit.

409
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,830
If hitting it once won't work, then do it twice. If twice won't work, then do it three times.

410
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,760
You will definitely succeed if you do it many times.

411
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,680
- Where is the warehouse?
- Over there.

412
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,670
Hurry and call the police!

413
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,880
Where is Zheng Xiao'en?

414
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,000
Don't hurt her.

415
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,380
You can't even fend for yourself, and you're in the mood to worry about her?

416
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,260
Looks like it's true love.

417
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,950
Situ Aoran! Situ Aoran, where are you?

418
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,590
Aoran, are you in there?

419
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,840
Zheng Xiao'en.

420
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,970
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

421
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,860
I'm here.

422
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,480
You're okay. That's good.

423
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,560
The door is locked.

424
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,910
I'll find a way to open it.

425
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,980
How can this be?

426
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,370
Give me a little more time. Use your phone as a flashlight.

427
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,340
He took my phone.

428
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,930
Don't be afraid! I'm here.

429
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,630
Aoran! Aoran, can you see my hand?

430
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,240
Aoran!

431
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,310
Aoran! Aoran!

432
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,140
Aoran, can you hear me?

433
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,970
My hand is here.

434
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,390
I found you.

435
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,780
Your hand is so warm.

436
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,320
Your hand is very cold. Are you okay?

437
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,010
When you're here, everything is okay.

438
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,420
Don't worry. This time I will definitely save you.

439
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,950
I will not let you get hurt.

440
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,290
Endure it a little while longer.

441
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,590
The door is locked. I'll go open it.

442
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,420
Don't leave!

443
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,050
What's wrong?

444
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,850
Zheng Xiao'en, promise me something.

445
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,440
As long as I reach out my hand,

446
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,470
I will be able to touch you.

447
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,480
This is the farthest distance you can be away from me.

448
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,350
Do you understand?

449
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,340
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

450
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:37,390
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

451
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:43,980
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

452
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,830

453
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,190
I will not let you get hurt.

454
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,760
Endure it a little while longer.

455
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,980
The door is locked. I'll go open it.

456
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,790
Don't leave!

457
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,440
What's wrong?

458
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,540
Zheng Xiao'en, promise me something.

459
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,400
As long as I reach out my hand,

460
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,890
I will be able to touch you.

461
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,790
This is the farthest distance you can be away from me.

462
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,750
Do you understand?

463
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,950
I promise you.

464
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,740
But you have to let me get you out of here first.

465
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,890
Wait for me.

466
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,520
Chuchu!

467
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,320
Chuchu!

468
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,410
Who allowed you to let Zheng Xiao'en out?

469
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,300
Chuchu!

470
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,900
Zheng Xiao'en!

471
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,530
Where are you?

472
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,750
Moran is back! Hurry and leave!

473
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,380
Aoran.

474
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,660
I won't leave you here. Absolutely not.

475
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,450
Don't act rashly.

476
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,270
If we both get caught, then who's going to call the police?

477
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,620
Quick. Listen to me.

478
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,210
I understand. Wait for me.

479
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,540
Zheng Xiao'en, come out!

480
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,480
Zheng Xiao'en!

481
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,230
Where are you?

482
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,520
Do you want to come out? We can have a proper chat.

483
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,530
Zheng Xiao'en!

484
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,470
You really think I don't dare?

485
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,890
Brother, what do you want to do?

486
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,560
I want to burn you into ashes

487
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,960
and conveniently see how much Zheng Xiao'en can tolerate it.

488
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,960
Brother, this is between the two of us.

489
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,460
It has nothing to do with Zheng Xiao'en.

490
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,680
If there's anything, come at me!

491
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,180
It's already like this and you still want to be the hero?

492
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,960
You really think you're that great?

493
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:35,790
Why? What did I do to make you hate me so much?

494
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,520
Because you stole my dad.

495
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,630
As long as you disappear, Dad will love me.

496
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,120
Dad doesn't not love you.

497
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,580
You say that Dad doesn't not love me.

498
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:59,700
Then, let me ask you, has he ever loved me before?

499
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,640
From when I was little,

500
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,900
I was always treated like air, like an invisible person in the Situ household!

501
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,020
Why? It's all because of you.

502
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,140
You're a successful CEO. What about me?

503
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,980
In his eyes, I'm a goddamn loser who fails at everything he does!

504
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,100
You just haven't succeeded yet.

505
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,560
Haven't I been supporting you no matter what?

506
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,570
Yeah, right.

507
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,060
Thank you,

508
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,520
but I hate you for that the most.

509
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,760
Saint mode completely activated, supporting me no matter what.

510
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,990
When you give me money, are you also laughing at me on the inside and looking down on me?

511
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,930
This time, when I asked for NT$20,000,000 (~US$680,000),

512
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,290
you didn't even blink, and you gave it to me.

513
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,100
I know.

514
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,000
Because you think this NT$20,000,000 will make me go away, and I won't disturb you.

515
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,330
You think I don't know what you're thinking?

516
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,510
I've never thought that before.

517
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,900
You do think like that!

518
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,030
Zheng Xiao'en! I'm going to count to three.

519
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:15,190
If you don't come out, I won't even let you two be buried together!

520
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,240
Xiao'en! Xiao'en!

521
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,710
No matter if you're here or not, you're not allowed to come out!

522
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:27,180
No matter what happens, cover your ears, close your eyes, and everything will be fine.

523
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,920
One!

524
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,420
Two!

525
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,930
Zheng Xiao'en isn't even here!

526
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,030
If there's anything, we can talk about it.

527
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,990
It has nothing to do with Xiao'en.

528
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,320
- Three!
- I'm right here.

529
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,190
You're finally willing to come out?

530
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,390
You really can tolerate it.

531
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,810
Didn't I tell you not to come out no matter what? Hurry and leave!

532
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:08,000
I said before that I won't leave you behind. I won't!

533
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,730
So you intend on being an arsonist now?

534
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:16,010
If I were your dad, I wouldn't want to give you any attention either.

535
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,760
You only know how to feel sorry for yourself.

536
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,700
How old are you? You're acting like a middle-schooler.

537
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,350
It's about time you learn to take responsibility for your life.

538
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,790
Brother, this is between us brothers.

539
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,870
We can have a good chat.

540
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,960
First let Xiao'en leave. Don't bring her into this.

541
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,410
You really think I'm faking this?

542
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,400
Do you believe that I'll burn you both until you're not even ashes?

543
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Situ Moran, if you dare to light the fire now,

544
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,350
you definitely won't be able to get away with it.

545
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,460
Don't force me.

546
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,390
I'm warning you, don't force me.

547
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,300
Do you really think doing this will make your dad love you?

548
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,760
He won't!

549
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,770
Even if Aoran dies, you're still you.

550
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,580
You can never be Situ Aoran.

551
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,080
Chuchu already called the police.

552
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,840
The police are on the way.

553
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,370
If you let us go now,

554
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:13,180
I can tell them that you brothers had a small fight,

555
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,820
and it was just a misunderstanding.

556
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,080
If you really kill someone,

557
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,960
the rest of your life will be ruined.

558
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,290
If you're not spending the rest of your life in jail, then you're spending the rest of your life on the run.

559
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,270
From then on, you won't be able to see the light.

560
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,880
Is this what you want?

561
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,260
You're so noisy.

562
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,030
I'll take care of you first and then take care of Situ Aoran.

563
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,960
Don't hurt her!

564
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,100
Situ Moran!

565
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,030
Aoran.

566
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,800
You can't win against me, dear CEO brother.

567
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,660
First, let Xiao'en go. I'll let you do whatever you want to me.

568
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,870
No!

569
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,530
Am I not the thorn in your side?

570
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:53,060
If I just completely back down, would you be satisfied?

571
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:01,190
Okay! Come here.

572
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,230
Why are you switching with me?

573
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,980
By doing this, everything we did before is worthless! Are you crazy?

574
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,560
Just treat it as if I've gone crazy.

575
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,070
For you, I'm willing.

576
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,400
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

577
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,530
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

578
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:47,950
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

579
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:55,960
You can't win against me, dear CEO brother.

580
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,830
First, let Xiao'en go. I'll let you do whatever you want to me.

581
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,930
No!

582
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,720
Am I not the thorn in your side?

583
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:12,000
If I just completely back down, would you be satisfied?

584
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:20,360
Okay! Come here.

585
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,350
Why are you switching with me?

586
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:29,120
By doing this, everything we did before is worthless! Are you crazy?

587
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,450
Just treat it as if I've gone crazy.

588
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,200
For you, I'm willing.

589
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,710
- You—
- I'm fine.

590
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,980
What are you doing?

591
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,820
Throw the knife away.

592
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,090
If you dare to hurt him, I'll set it all on fire.

593
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:06,230
Everyone dies and nobody lives.

594
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,200
Zheng Xiao'en, stop it!

595
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,260
Disappear before me right now. Hurry and leave!

596
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,170
I don't want to. I won't leave!

597
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,290
Is today the first day you met me? When have I ever been that obedient?

598
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:18,070
Leave! Leave right now! Hurry and leave!

599
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,120
You're almost dead, and you still care about whether I leave or not.

600
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,090
You really think an overbearing CEO can conquer the universe?

601
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:24,830
If you don't leave now, do you want to die?

602
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:28,920
That's right. I want to die with you.

603
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,610
If you die, how can I go on living peacefully?

604
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:35,030
I can't do it.

605
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,980
It's already like this and you're still arguing with me?

606
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,400
Where did you come from?

607
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,950
Why do I like a woman like you?

608
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,090
You like me?

609
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,030
No kidding!

610
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:59,000
I never thought that I would personally hear you say that you like me.

611
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,870
Are you two done?

612
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,990
Even if I die now,

613
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,300
I have no more regrets.

614
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,740
No, I do.

615
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:28,400
I still have a lot of things I want to do with you.

616
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,420
- Xiao'en!
- Are you okay?

617
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,810
Are you hurt anywhere?

618
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,380
What about you? Does it hurt?

619
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,580
Seeing that you're okay, any injuries no longer hurt.

620
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,580
Does it hurt?

621
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,910
What's wrong?

622
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,910
I almost lost you.

623
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,540
Your hand is still as warm as before.

624
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,210
Remember what you promised me.

625
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,460
As long as I reach out my hand,

626
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,830
I will be able to touch you.

627
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,970
This is the farthest distance you can be away from me.

628
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:53,810
I can touch you, feel you, and sense you.

629
00:56:53,810 --> 00:57:01,920
From the beginning to the end, it's always been Situ Aoran, not anyone else.

630
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,670
It's not He Tianxing.

631
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,290
It's you.

632
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:21,460
You're the one I like, Situ Aoran.

633
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:25,920
You're no one's substitute.

634
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,020
You're one of a kind.

635
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,750
Nobody can replace you.

636
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,340
♫ The silhouettes of the concrete jungle ♫

637

I can schedule you for a walk-in appointment right now.

No, we can't let anyone know about this.

01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,160
Do you understand?

686
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,570
Do you want to go out or did you just get back home?

687
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,910
What did you do to be looking like this?

688
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:55,960

- Me?
- Yeah.

697
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,060
to tell me to come back to work at the head office starting today. Did you forget?

- What's going on?
- So strange.

Can't you just accept reality?

I'll keep sleeping.

So what should I do now?

01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:44,270

Does it have something to do with He Tianxing?

739

01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,610
Like this.

743
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:11,700
You could feel yourself grabbing my arm?

744
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,910
But you actually did nothing to save me.

745
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,790
Just like that, you let someone push me away.

746
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:24,410
I didn't purposefully let go... it's—

747
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,900
No matter what the circumstance is, you shouldn't let go of my hand.

Then... what else did you dream of?

749
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,020
I dreamt of... breakfast.

I know you like Zheng Xiao'en.

Don't you want to know what place you have in Zheng Xiao'en's heart?

756
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,430
Are you willing to lose her like this?

757
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:53,670
Aoran still has dreams even now, so that means He Tianxing is still unconscious.

01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:58,980
If He Tianxing wakes up, will Situ Aoran die?
