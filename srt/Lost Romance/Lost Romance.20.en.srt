00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,240
He Tianxing, even if you had heavenly powers,

164
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,980
you wouldn't be able to find anything.

165
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,560
You're not afraid that we'll report to the police?

166
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,830
Everything I've done is legal.

167
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,110
Besides, Tianjian was the one who signed the contract.

168
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,220
How has the He family ever wronged you?

169
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,050
Thirty years. Thirty years!

170
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,770
For thirty years, I worked myself to the bone for Tianliang, and what did I get?

171
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,200
Thirty years ago, when Tianliang had just gotten started,

172
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,220
He Zhaonan put in the money, but I put in the effort.

173
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,830
And bit by bit, we grew Tianliang Group to what it is now.

174
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
But what have I gained?

175
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
They guarded against me like they would guard against a thief.

176
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,870
Not even a single stock was given to me.

177
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,950
Before He Zhaonan left,

178
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,230
he still wanted me to continue assisting He Tianxing.

179
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,180
Your family wants to treat me like your dog?!

180
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,250
You know, in my eyes, the three of you

181
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,440
don't have a single redeeming feature except for your surname He.

182
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,930
If the three of you didn't have seeds of betrayal in your hearts,

183
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,330
no matter how much I watered it,

184
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,860
not a single evil flower would ever bloom within you.

185
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,130
That's right, I want He Zhaonan to know that

186
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,550
handing this company over to the Hes

187
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,970
is a wrong decision beyond all reason!

188
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,170
Hu Chaoqin!

189
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,320
He Tianxing, what are you doing?

190
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:42,170
Uncle Hu, seeing as you've worked so hard for the He family for the past thirty years,

191
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,020
just leave.

192
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,760
He Tianxing, are you crazy? How can you just let him leave?

193
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,160
You're not playing any tricks?

194
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,010
No tricks.

195
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,740
What are you doing?!

196
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,560
You just let him leave?

197
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
He almost destroyed the entire Tianliang.

198
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,050
I've already handed the bag of diamonds

199
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,630
and the rest of the evidence we've collected to the police.

200
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,020
To him, I couldn't say too much.

201
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,120
Because Tianliang does owe him.

202
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,320
But he committed a crime,

203
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,010
and he'll have to pay for that in the end.

204
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,470
Help me pack my luggage and passport.

205
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,770
I have to leave the country for few days.

206
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay. Good.

207

[Police]

208

Tianjian.

209
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,280
Mom, don't be sad.

210
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,250
It's not like I'll be jailed forever.

211
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,300
Also, once I get out,

212
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,430
I can do things with both feet on the ground.

213
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,910
That's good, isn't it?

214
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,290
During this time, you have to stay strong.

215
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,620
What are you doing?

216
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,300
Sometimes, being a strong woman may not be a good thing.

217
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,970
This is what I learned in life.

218
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,710
If you don't force me to be a strong woman,

219
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,160
I won't force you to be a little woman anymore.

220
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,370
When you come out,

221
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,530
I will definitely learn how to respect you.

222
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,290
Do not cry in front of me.

223
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,310
I won't.

224
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,650
You.

225
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,590
Yes?

226
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,020
I'm leaving my mom in your care.

227
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,210
Do not worry, Miss.

228
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,020
Thanks.

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,880
I've always wanted to say "thanks" to you.

230
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,890
All this time, you have been doing everything you could to help me.

231
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,960
It's just that I've never been able to find the right time.

232
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,950
Thank you.

233
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,200
This is my duty.

234
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,990
We need to go in.

235
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,720
Hello, everyone. I am Tianliang Group's new chairman, He Tianxing.

236
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,300
First, I want to send my sincerest apologies regarding the recent crises

237
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:35,110
to all the employees, investors, and others who care for Tianliang.

238
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,180
Tianliang Group has decided to move forward with a strategic HR adjustment

239
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,550
in order to implement favorable resignation and retirement plans.

240
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,480
Also, regarding the capital losses caused by wrong decisions,

241
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,580
in addition to negotiating with bank groups,

242
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,180
we also plan to use the skills we have to attract foreign investors.

243
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,630
Within the company, we also want to change the management system

244
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,520
and explore the talent we have internally.

245
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,260
We will train professional managers to straighten out our problems arising from

246
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,950
the cross-shareholding of our hospitality, real estate, and financial institutions.

247
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,720
CEO.

248
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,790
My stomach hurts. Accompany me to the restroom.

249
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,710
Let's go.

250
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,740
You've just returned to the company,

251
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,370
and the company already seems like a whole new place.

252
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,210
I believe that the company will only improve from now on.

253
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,350
Thank you.

254
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,600
After the company affairs have come to an end,

255
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,550
does that mean there will be time

256
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,410
for us to watch the sunrise together?

257
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,380
Ling Chuchu.

258
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,800
I'm very sorry. I may have to cancel.

259
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,430
I don't need to see the sunrise anymore,

260
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:03,700
because I have found a source of strength to move forward and be happy.

261
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,520
CEO, do you have a girlfriend?

262
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,130
I feel like your aura has changed.

263
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,960
When a lonely person sees another lonely person,

264
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,220
they understand the shared loneliness.

265
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,700
But now, I don't sense

266
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,540
a feeling of loneliness on you anymore.

267
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,020
Maybe you're right.

268
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,420
But she's not my girlfriend yet.

269
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,410
She's still not?

270
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,560
She will be eventually.

271
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,700
I believe that the person who can make you happy

272
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,730
must be a person who’s the most suitable for you.

273
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,870
I give you guys my blessings.

274
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,510
Thank you.

275
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,920
Same goes for you.

276
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,940
It’s very easy to wallow in grief,

277
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,270
but walking out of it is the same.

278
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,230
You just have to change your mind.

279
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,430
Your dad would want you to be happy.

280
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,220
Thank you, CEO.

Even though Tianliang Group was bogged down in crisis before,

291
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,220
once he made his move,

292
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,870
it feels like restoring their former glory is just a matter of time.

I just finished interviewing you, and you have an accident.

487

I was afraid the book wouldn't sell well, okay?

488
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
That's all reasonable.

Back then, who was the one that asked me if I was afraid of the dark?

And who kept looking at me with those foolish eyes?

Can't you say those were loving eyes?

Yes, just like Situ Aoran.

But there was only me and my mom at home,

544
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,490
so even if I told people I was afraid of the dark,

545
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,410
no one would be able to help me.

546
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,360
I had to find a way to get over it on my own.

547
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,710
I hated my circumstances in life,

548
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,540
and I hated the way everyone else looked at me,

549
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:59,880
but I could only rely on myself to get over it.

550
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:07,070
So you hid that other side of yourself?

Yeah.

But how did that version of you end up inside my novel?

560
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,910
I should be asking you that.

561
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,210
All I know is that when I fell from the building,

562

00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,690
a huge sense of despair.

you should consider yourself unlucky.

Even so, you still fell in love with me,

It was you who pulled me from the other side of the moon.

On our first day of marriage,

715
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:29,030
you're calling out another man's name first thing in the morning.

716
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,540
You're really not letting me down.

It's not what you think.

718
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,740
Then what is it?

719
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,920
It might sound a little unbelievable,

720
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,920
but I promise it doesn't mean anything else.

721
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,670
I just serendipitously dreamt of Qingfeng.

How did you know?

725
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,460
I had the same dream.

726
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,770
Really?

727
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,500
I think Qingfeng specifically came to say goodbye to us.

728
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:15,830
After wandering for so long,

729
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:19,730
Qingfeng finally got his own happy ending.

730
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,370
But Qingfeng once said that

731
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:27,780
all main characters disappear when the stories end.

732
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,390
So did they disappear too?

733
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,330
All the characters who disappeared in the books

734
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,740
will reappear in the hearts of the readers.

- What?

741
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,560
Aren't you forgetting something?

742
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,530
What?

01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,500

01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,770

01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,770
We haven't even brushed our teeth yet. It's so stinky!

746
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:33,230
I've seen that it's always written this way in the romance novels.

747
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:35,200
They say it's sweeter like this.

748
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,700
Wait! Those are novels. You can't trust them.

749
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,500
Why can't you trust novels?

750
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,940
I fell in love with you in a novel.

751
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:49,250
Could it be that you're questioning our love?

752
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,820
That's not what I meant.

753
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,970
Then come here.

754
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:57,510
- No! Wait! I haven't brushed my teeth!
- I don't care.

755
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:58,950
Save me!

756
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:03,370
