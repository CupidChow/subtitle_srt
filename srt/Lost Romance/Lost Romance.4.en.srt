I've always wanted to give you the money for dry cleaning,

159
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,060
but I couldn't find you after my interview was over.

160
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,350
No wonder you knew I've been here for a year.

161
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,280
I... see you around sometimes.

162
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,630
Do you still remember how much the dry cleaning fee was?

163
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,960
Then...

164
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,060
If you really want to compensate me,

165
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,190
how about you make one of those for me?

166
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,420
- But this is just something really small.
- It's okay.

167
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,940
Then, pick a scent.

168
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,980
I'll make one that's a little more masculine for you.

169
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,030
So where were you going?

170
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,030
Now that we can't get out, will it delay your work?

171
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,690
- Xiao'en told me to go get the keys for the meeting room.
- Xiao'en?

172
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,280
She asked me to go get it at 3 PM, saying that the strategy department had a meeting.

173
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,870
Yes.

174
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,400
I understand. Thank you.

175
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,130
CSO, security said someone scratched your car

176
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,690
and asked that you go to the parking lot to take a look.

177
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,770
Looks like Xiao'en played a little prank on us.

178
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,920
What's wrong?

179
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,830
Do you always get pranked?

180
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,300
No, no.

181
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,550
Do the people in the marketing department often bully you?

182
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,440
No! There is no bullying...

183
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,690
We're all adults. There's no such thing as bullying.

184
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,480
In the past, you were splashed with water in the bathroom.

185
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,960
Then the electrical wires caught on fire.

186
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,860
And now, Xiao'en made this strange request, asking you to get the keys at 3 PM.

187
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,290
Don't you think it's weird?

188
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,140
It's really not!

189
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Chuchu, no matter what happens, you can tell me.

190
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,930
It really is nothing.

191
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,780
If my seniors don't like me,

192
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,400
it's definitely because I haven't been performing well.

193
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,180
It'll be fine when I catch up.

194
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,450
No matter how well you perform, people who don't like you still won't like you.

195
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,300
I heard that the company tends to fire people who don't work well with others

196
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,980
rather than people who are forceful.

197
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,630
Silly.

198
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,360
What the company cares about is fairness.

199
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,650
At least, I won't let anything unfair happen when I'm around.

200
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,820
What? What, what? Why are you looking at me like that?

201
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:34,010
Let me tell you, what you're holding in your hand right now is evidence of you cooperating with me.

202
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,930
What else do you have to say for yourself?

203
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,960
It's not what it looks like.

204
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,540
It's also not what you think.

205
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,690
What am I thinking?

206
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,000
There is only one thing I believe in right now.

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
What?

208
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,960
You are fired!

209
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,280
Don't try to trick me by putting medicinal oil on your eyes to make yourself cry.

210
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,670
Do you think I'm blind?

211
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,910
The stories are all lies...

212
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,080
What's wrong?

213
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,800
Boss fired me.

214
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,530
Why?

215
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,160
Do you know why you were stuck in the elevator just now?

216
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,850
I... think I know why.

217
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,270
Oh? You know?

218
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,230
It's not what you think.

219
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,980
Oh. Not what I think again.

220
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,490
It's also not what it looked like.

221
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,320
Not what it looked like again.

222
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,130
I promise you, Xiao'en does not have any intentions of hurting Chuchu.

223
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,580
Oh. Xiao'en?

224
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,750
Situ.

225
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,320
Then tell me in simple Chinese terms what exactly happened.

226
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,990
- Actually, it's that Xiao'en—
- Enough.

227
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,230
I did this myself, so I'll bear the consequences.

228
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,340
I hurt Chuchu, electrocuted her, and wanted to trap her in the freezer truck.

229
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,340
It was also me who wanted to trap her in the elevator so that she would not be able to leave work on time. Okay?

230
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,270
- Xiao'en.
- It's fine.

231
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,510
Can I go now?

232
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,610
- Desk lamp.
- I bought that.

233
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,310
The stapler and scissors are the company's.

234
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,690
Overbearing CEO. His heart is as small as a needle's hole.

235
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,770
I barely scratched his white lotus,

236
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,270
and now he's keeping watch of even the stapler and scissors.

237
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,140
Now that I'm thinking about it, stapler and scissors are worth money too.

238
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,660
I have no friends nor family here.

239
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,500
A pair of scissors might be able to get me a bento box.

240
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,720
As a cherished male lead,

241
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,410
he has to singlehandedly fight all the madwomen of the world.

242
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,390
It's too difficult for me!

243
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,140
Xiao'en!

244
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,330
You're here to give me money?

245
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,630
Severance?

246
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,270
You were fired because you did something wrong.

247
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,360
It's already pretty good that the company isn't asking you to compensate.

248
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,030
Then thank you for your warm goodbye in the midst of this cold breeze.

249
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,630
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

250
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,350
Wait, Xiao'en.

251
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,680
Why didn't you let me explain everything to Aoran?

252
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,790
Even though it is a little awkward,

253
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,250
at least he wouldn't have asked you to leave the company.

254
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,440
Did you hear the last thing he said to me?

255
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,060
He asked me for the stapler and scissors!

256
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,580
If you like the company's stapler and scissors, I'll personally gift it to you.

257
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,240
No, no, no. You're missing the point.

258
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,850
The point is that someone who would bicker with you over a stapler and scissors

259
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,210
is someone who is extremely petty.

260
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,820
Aoran has always been someone who's very principled when it comes to business.

261
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,390
I'll explain to him. I'm sure he'll understand.

262
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,800
You know the normal CEO.

263
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,640
You don't know the in-love CEO, do you?

264
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
Huh?

265
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,370
You know that the CEO has special feelings for Chuchu, right?

266
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,950
It won't be good for you if he finds out you like Chuchu as well.

267
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,360
If you want to fight with the overbearing CEO over his woman, history shows that it won't end well.

268
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,760
Really?

269
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,250
Believe me. I've read hundreds of books with this same plot.

270
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,800
Fighting with the emperor over his woman?

271
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,430
Sent to the front line!

272
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,020
Fighting with the chairman over his woman?

273
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,200
You're still sent to the front line!

274
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,780
Fighting with the gang leader over his woman?

275
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,540
- Sent to the front line?
- Wrong. You'll be made into dumplings.

276
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,060
Why would they make you into dumplings?

277
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,010
That's not the point.

278
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,020
So... you're planning to bear it all by yourself?

279
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,350
I'll bear this situation so don't complicate things.

280
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,970
Or else... not only would it be bad for you, but it'll also be bad for Chuchu.

281
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,580
Then what do you plan to do next?

282
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,310
Don't know. I guess I'll figure it out as I go.

283
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,720
I wonder if there are employment agencies here.

284
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,690
Or maybe I should open up a restaurant.

285
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,880
Do they have beef noodle soup?

286
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,860
Popcorn chicken! They don't have that here.

287
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,810
Maybe I can open the first popcorn chicken shop in the overbearing CEO world!

288
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,390
Xiao'en!

289
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,210
Unless you're going to be my sugar daddy, I don't wanna hear it!

290
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,390
Xiao'en!

291
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,180
Do you know how to fix toilets?

292
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,620
Huh?

293
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,000
I said, do you know how to fix toilets?

294
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,740
Yes. I've been on my own since I was little.

295
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,970
Killing cockroaches, painting walls, laying tiles. There's nothing I can't do.

296
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,150
Good. I just so happen to have a job for you.

297
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,090
A job? What job?

298
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,880
I just said it. Fixing toilets.

299
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,970
What? Fixing toilets?

300
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,370
Go home and pack your stuff, and then go here to report for work.

301
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,060
Don't worry. Room and board is included.

302
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,150
It's in a quiet environment, with its back against a mountain and facing the ocean.

303
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,160
It's in the north and faces south.

304
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,580
Don't thank me too much.

305
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,310
Why does the place he described seem like some sort of pagoda?

306
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,070
I know. Don't be late tomorrow.

307
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,380
What's wrong?

308
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,460
Nothing. I'll get going now.

309
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,560
Bye bye.

310
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,050
What are you doing! Thief! Thief!

311
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,890
Help! Theif!

312
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,020
Jason?

313
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,620
What are you doing? You let him get away!

314
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,930
At least your purse isn't stolen.

315
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,830
Something's missing.

316
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,950
What?

317
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,020
I know who they are.

318
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,120
You're really curious, right?

319
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,210
What does Dad's will say?

320
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,620
What will I get?

321
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,990
What will be given to you?

322
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,000
[A Landmark of Excellence]

323
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,920
Wow! Indeed, rich people's friends are still rich.

324
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,510
No wonder he said to not thank him too much.

325
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,680
Judging by this mansion, the boss will probably pay a lot for fixing the toilet.

326
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,040
And room and board are included?

327
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,760
Qingfeng sure is Qingfeng.
(Qingfeng means spring breeze)

328
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,770
You can tell that he's kind just from his name.

329
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,270
Unlike that Situ Aoran. Arrogant and proud.
(Aoran means proud, lofty)

330
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,970
His eyes are on top of his head.

331
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,930
If you close the door, I'll yell so that the entire universe will hear.

332
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,010
No matter how loud you yell, no one's going to care.

333
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,630
Fine, I'll leave.

334
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,110
Hey! Hey!

335
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,890
There's no way you can pull me out by yourself.

336
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,710
If you call someone over here, that means there will be someone who cares when I yell.

337
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,510
I fired her because I didn't want to see her anymore.

338
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,180
Now you've sent her to my house. What's the meaning of this?

339
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,230
Didn't you want me to find someone? I found someone.

340
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,750
But not her!

341
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,620
Didn't you say that your toilet broke and that it's an urgent matter?

342
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,470
No matter how urgent, I still don't want to see her.

343
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,150
Doctors aren't going to agree with what you just said.

344
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,990
Humans can go without food for a day,

345
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,720
but they can't not use the bathroom for a whole day.

346
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,710
Also, it's perfect that she knows how to fix toilets.

347
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,820
Her?

348
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,320
She really knows how to.

349
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,560
I really know how to.

350
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,210
Why are you being so mean? If you give me a dirty look again,

351
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,510
I'll forcibly stage the storyline of the overbearing housekeeper and the handsome CEO.

352
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,340
Does it taste good?

353
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,650
So good.

354
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,430
Then how are you going to repay me?

355
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,950
The bottom line is, I'm not hiring her.

356
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,920
Come over here and take her away.

357
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,250
Not only does she know how to fix toilets,

358
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,050
but she also knows how to change light bulbs.

359
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,970
You really think I can't afford a plumber or an electrician?

360
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,980
Do you think that you'd be able to avoid me by hiring a plumber or an electrician?

361
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,830
You must not have read CEO's Sweetheart Electrician,

362
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,300
the book our company released last month.

363
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,330
It's you.

364
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,990
You've got the wrong person.

365
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,460
Impossible. I'd be able to recognize you even if you turned into ash.

366
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:09,920
Tell me. Where have you hidden our child?

367
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:27,590
Think about how convenient it is to live with someone who can fix your light bulbs at any time.

368
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,950
Let me ask you, can you sleep in an environment without light?

369
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,520
Situ.

370
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,300
She won't do. She is the person who hurt Chuchu.

371
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,360
Then forget it. I have nothing more to say.

372
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,560
Tell her to go.

373
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,800
She's not in your office nor your home.

374
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,120
Then she won't be under your control.

375
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,380
Of course.

376
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,130
Since she won't be under your control,

377
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,280
that means you can't control what she does either.

378
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,520
You especially won't be able to control what she'll do to Chuchu.

379
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,430
Chuchu won't just stay at the office.

380
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,230
What will you do if something happens to her after work?

381
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,240
Can you watch her all 24 hours of the day?

382
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,190
Since you can't, why don't you solve the problem from the source?

383
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,970
Situ.

384
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,990
What you say makes sense.

385
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,800
You. Come with me.

386
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,440
What is it?

387
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,920
Can't you fix toilets?

388
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,030
Don't force me to follow those storylines!

389
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,970
Whatever. I don't feel like following any storyline right now.

390
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,970
Go bring the tools.

391
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,940
G-Go?

392
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,630
Mr. Boss, please move your noble legs

393
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,450
and go to the tool shed to bring my lowly self a high-quality and fancy toolbox, okay?

394
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,900
The toilet float is just crooked.

395
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,250
It won't float up, so your water level's too low.

396
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,120
It'll be fine after I adjust it a bit.

397
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,440
Also, shouldn't you replace this rubber gasket?

398
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,350
Is there anything else I can help you with?

399
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,320
No.

400
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,000
If you want to work in my house, you must remember a few things.

401
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,730
It's here! It's here! The things to pay attention to when it comes to the CEO.

402
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,950
Proper cleaning is the basic expectation.

403
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,530
I don't want my house to seem messy.

404
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:20,640
So all the furniture that you see must return to its original place after use.

405
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,050
I understand. You are a very orderly CEO.

406
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,430
I don't like strong smells.

407
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:35,720
So things like scallions, garlic, and pickled vegetables are absolutely not allowed in the fridge.

408
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,980
I understand. What goes in the fridge then?

409
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,130
Also, the rags have to be boiled every day.

410
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,490
I understand. If you don't cook, what do you use rags for?

411
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,600
The fourth floor is my study. You don't need to clean up there.

412
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,360
You absolutely cannot go inside without my permission.

413
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,600
Where's your "I understand"? Speak.

414
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,480
- What about your room?
- Is my room a place for you to see?

415
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,090
- How am I supposed to clean it then?
- You don't need to clean my room.

416
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,670
- What if the bathroom's broken?
- Are you doubting my words?

417
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,290
No! I just doubt your skills as a tour guide.

418
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,200
What?

419
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,890
Also, the most important thing is, I don't like the dark.

420
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:42,090
So none of the lights in the house can be turned off.

421
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,550
You don't turn off lights to sleep?

422
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,980
I can't fall asleep with the lights on.

423
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,570
Then turn off the lights to your room only.

424
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,450
What about the kitchen, living room, or your study?

425
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,910
You cannot turn them off.

426
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:01,720
Can this be the so-called weakness that a CEO must have?

427
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,040
Are you afraid of the dark?

428
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,850
I just told you that I don't like the dark.

429
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,920
Yes, yes. If the lights aren't on, you might trip if you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.

430
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,100
Shut up.

431
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,060
Because of you, I have one more important matter that needs attention.

432
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,160
- What is it?
- Mind your own business. Don't be nosy.

433
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,530
Okay, CEO.

434
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,840
I'm not as easygoing as Qingfeng.

435
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,260
Don't pull any stunts in front of me.

436
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,950
I will be watching you.

437
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,930
Don't get any weird ideas.

438
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,200
This is your room.

439
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,550
Is this really my room?

440
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,790
It's amazing!

441
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,640
I feel like crying!

442
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,920
This is bigger than any place I've ever lived in.

443
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,190
This bed. This elasticity. This feeling!

444
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:49,300
Is this the legendary spine protector?

445
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,660
I'm so happy!

446
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,950
At this time, I want to encourage myself by saying a line from an overbearing CEO.

447
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,000
What line?

448
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:10,410
I wake up from a very large bed every day to face two hundred beautiful maids.

449
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,010
However, my wealth doesn't bring me happiness.

450
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,460
Go away! Rotten banknotes!

451
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,020
Go away! Stop bothering me!

452
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,050
Zheng Xiao'en.

453
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,410
- Yes, Boss?
- Stop messing around.

454
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,990
Otherwise I don't know what I'll do to you.

455
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,910
I'm afraid that once the light is off,

456
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:43,020
I won't be able to stop myself from beating you to death or strangling myself to death.

457
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,620
Hurry and organize your things.

458
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,000
I don't want to see you for the rest of the night.

459
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,390
Happiness came to me too suddenly.

460
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,590
Orphanage Director, is this real?

461
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,590
Is there really someone willing to adopt me?

462
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,410
Are you happy that you get to live with the person you like?

463
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,120
Strictly speaking, he's not really the person I like.

464
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,560
He's more like my strategic target.

465
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,230
But there's not much of a difference.

466
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,310
Don't thank me too much.

467
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,200
No words can express my gratitude for your great kindness.

468
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,060
From now on, you're my Supreme Master Qingfeng.

469
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,390
Who's Supreme Master Qingfeng?

470
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,720
Don't worry about it.

471
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,030
All you need to know is that

472
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,430
it holds the most brilliant spot in my heart, just like popcorn chicken does.

473
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,060
Though I don't know what popcorn chicken is,

474
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,230
I can tell that you're very happy.

475
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,640
Thanks, Supreme Master Qingfeng!

476
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,650
I just think that there must be some misunderstanding between you and Aoran.

477
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,370
He seems cold and detached on the outside, but he's a really good person.

478
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:18,230
I know. I probably understand CEOs more than you do.

479
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,400
That's good. I also hope that Aoran can resolve his misunderstanding of you.

480
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,980
Thank you.

481
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,460
You are a valuable friend.

482
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,160
Are you sick?

483
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,710
Aiya, you wouldn't get it.

484
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,460
Okay, I've already passed the ball to you.

485
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,320
It’s up to you to make the most of this opportunity.

486
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:54,160
You, too! You can ask me any questions about pursuing the white lotus.

487
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,350
- Okay.
- That's all. Bye.

488
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:10,850
Why do I feel in my heart that Qingfeng is sweet and considerate

489
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,830
and that I strangely want to cheer him on?

490
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,980
What's going on?

491
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,920
Forget it. I'll go shower first.

492
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,400
I'll be right back.

493
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,930
Where is my suitcase?

494
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,560
Is my room a place for you to see?

495
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,010
- How am I supposed to clean it then?
- You don't need to clean my room.

496
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,280
Boss.

497
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,040
I know you don't want me to go in.

498
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,800
But... I'm sorry, my suitcase is in there.

499
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,620
Can I go in to get it?

500
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,960
Boss?

501
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,410
Did he go out?

502
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,410
Could this be reverse psychology?

503
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,040
The more you don't want me to go in,

504
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,130
the more I want to go in.

505
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,290
The more you don't want me to touch,

506
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,580
the more I want to touch.

507
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:00,050
Wow. I feel like I'm in Disneyland.

508
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,980
Dreams come true.

509
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,420
It smells so good.

510
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:28,830
So you're the relaxing manly smell that I smelled as soon as I entered the room.

511
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,320
Contains natural plant extract essential oils.

512
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,780
Wow, CEO uses such luxury items.

513
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,810
No, no. I need quickly get my things before Boss comes back.

514
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,010
Zheng Xiao'en, you have two choices right now.

515
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,860
One is to be a respectable woman.

516
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,060
Have some dignity. Take the suitcase and go.

517
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,820
The other choice is to take advantage of being in Disneyland.

518
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,090
The chance to experience a whole new world, which others line up three hours for and still might not get to experience,

519
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,380
is right before your eyes.

520
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,590
♫ Lost to you ♫

521
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:05,140
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

522
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,470
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

523
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:14,550
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

524
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:21,000
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

525
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,710
Zheng Xiao'en, you have two choices right now.

526
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,490
One is to be a respectable woman.

527
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,700
Have some dignity. Take the suitcase and go.

528
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,600
The other choice is to take advantage of being in Disneyland.

529
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,800
The chance to experience a whole new world, which others line up three hours for and still might not get to experience,

530
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,120
is right before your eyes.

531
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,850
In the midst of hot steam, the silhouette of a man who emits an icy aura stands against the light.

532
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,010
Exquisite muscles rise and fall with every breath.

533
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:33,170
Like a cheetah.

534
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,420
I will never protest again when a writer writes "a cheetah."

535
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,190
What is a tiger or a panda?

536
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:46,610
The lines outlining these muscles and this explosiveness are that of a cheetah.

537
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,390
Didn't I say you can't go into my room?

538
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,590
Who told you to kneel?

539
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,410
Do you think that I'll forgive you just because you're kneeling? Get up!

540
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,950
I'm not kneeling because of you. I'm kneeling for Adam Smith.
(He is known as the "Father of Economics/Capitalism")

541
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,620
You—

542
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,600
Inhale.

543
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,160
Exhale.

544
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,190
Give me your cell phone.

545
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,930
Cell phone?

546
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,020
Oh, you think I snuck a picture of you?

547
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,980
Inhale.

548
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,930
Give me your cell phone.

549
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:40,150
I don't want to. I'm not the kind of person you think I am.

550
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,270
You're not the kind of person I think you are?

551
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,620
I saw with my own eyes what kind of person you are!

552
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,340
From the first time I saw you,

553
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,260
I knew you were someone who has no ethics.

554
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,890
Would a respectable woman peek at a man who's showering?

555
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,620
No! But you did.

556
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,510
Since you'd even go into the bathroom to peek at me showering,

557
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,020
who knows if you snuck a picture and if you'll threaten me later with my nude photos?

558
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,510
Who's taking pictures? Who's threatening you?

559
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,400
Go look for yourself!

560
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,910
Nothing, right?

561
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:26,040
That's right. A respectable woman wouldn't peek at a man showering.

562
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,480
But am I a respectable woman?

563
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,690
No. I'm an unlucky woman!

564
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,040
I am so unlucky that my boss fired me even though I was doing a perfectly fine job.

565
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,010
I'm so unlucky that I came here to be a housekeeper and was targeted by my boss.

566
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,420
I'm so unlucky that the moment I got here, I put my suitcase in that golden bathroom

567
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,670
because I was fixing that golden toilet.

568
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,380
When my boss walked naked into the bathroom, did he see my suitcase?

569
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:52,050
He did see it! Anyone with eyes wouldn't miss it.

570
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,490
Did he think to tell me?

571
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,100
Did he think about how I could survive without my suitcase tonight?

572
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,590
No! Because all he thinks about is himself.

573
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:01,620
- You—
- Inhale!

574
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,620
Even so, you still peeked.

575
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,830
You're acting so self-righteous after peeking and even giving a bunch of excuses!

576
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,340
How can there be a woman like you who doesn't have any sense of propriety!

577
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,270
Because, since I was a child, I didn't have parents to teach me propriety, okay?

578
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,050
Fine, I peeked.

579
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:19,030
I am shameless. I admit I am brazen.

580
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,720
But aren't you at fault too?

581
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,730
What did I do wrong?

582
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,530
Who told you to look so handsome?

583
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,830
You have charisma; your muscles are toned; your body proportions are good; and your legs are long!

584
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,030
Even your fingers are prettier than other people's.

585
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,740
Let me ask you, if it were you, would you look?

586
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,460
Of course you would look! How broken does your head have to be to not look?

587
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,620
Any normal person would.

588
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,230
Never mind that I just happened to see it.

589
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:43,990
Anyone passing by who can smell those pheromones would pause.

590
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,200
The enjoyment of such a sight is an oasis in the desert,

591
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,190
a small comfort in a hard and bitter life,

592
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,400
and a little bit of happiness stolen from the shower head.

593
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,990
It's just a little bit, and you won't let me look?

594
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,650
Let's take a thousand steps back and think about it a different way.

595
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,040
If you weren't so handsome, didn't work on that physique,

596
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,560
completely let go of yourself, and became a big fatty weighing more than 100 kg,

597
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,020
I promise I wouldn't take a single look at you.

598
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,320
♫ Lost to you ♫

599
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:34,250
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

600

I am shameless. I admit I am brazen.

608
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,760
But aren't you at fault too?

609
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,950
What did I do wrong?

610
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,790
Who told you to look so handsome?

611
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,970
You have charisma; your muscles are toned; your body proportions are good; and your legs are long!

612
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,290
Even your fingers are prettier than other people's.

613
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:20,100

Anyone passing by who can smell those pheromones would pause.

618
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,380
The enjoyment of such a sight is an oasis in the desert,

619
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,320
a small comfort in a hard and bitter life,

620
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,560
and a little bit of happiness stolen from the shower head.

621
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,000
It's just a little bit, and you won't let me look?

622
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,870
Let's take a thousand steps back and think about it a different way.

623
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,270
If you weren't so handsome, didn't work on that physique,

I promise I wouldn't take a single look at you.

626
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,000
Should I be mad right now?

627
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,560
Don't do it again.

628
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:29,260
Hey, we just got to the climax! You...

629
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,330
Boss, are you still going to pursue this matter of my peeking?

630
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,020
If you're not going to pursue it, then I'm going back to my room.

631
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,200
I'm really going!

632
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,340
No way, such a petty overbearing CEO

633
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,490
would take it up and put it down so lightly?

634
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,880
Or will he have other tricks later?

635
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,370
No way! He can't be that petty.

636
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,510
So... he's really letting me get away with it?

637
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,660
I thought that I would be fired so I pressed my luck and yelled at him.

638
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,890
If I had known that the overbearing CEO had a heart as wide as the Pacific Ocean,

639
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,940
I would...

640
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,390
I wouldn't do anything.

641
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,170
Who told you to look so handsome?

642
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,360
You have charisma; your muscles are toned; your body proportions are good; and your legs are long!

643
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,660
Even your fingers are prettier than other people's.

644
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,000
Let me ask you, if it were you, would you look?

645
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,210
My parents gave it to me. What can I do?

646
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,910
Zheng Xiao'en, you really have no shame.

647
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,910
I can't believe that you're reliving it.

648
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,950
It's so blissful to be in a world with an overbearing CEO.

649
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,960
The existence of an overbearing CEO is so heartwarming.

650
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,110
Since I'm living in the overbearing CEO's house,

651
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,740
I must make him fall in love with me.

652
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,560
One day, one motto: Zheng Xiao'en, you can do it!

653
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,820
In order to appease the boss, I got up before the sun came up.

654
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,730
Zheng Xiao'en, you're so good!

655
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:09,290
It deserves Teacher Aoran giving you five apples on your homework.

656
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,670
As they say, in order to capture a man's heart,

657
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,250
you must first capture his stomach.

658
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:19,960
Now, let's go and examine Teacher Aoran's appetite together.

659
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,030
Braised beef brisket!

660
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:27,280
Stir-fried beef with satay sauce! Beef fried with scallions!

661
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,190
What if he doesn't eat beef?

662
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:35,280
Fried pork cutlet! Crispy ribs!

663
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,940
Wait...

664
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,830
maybe CEO is Muslim.

665
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,370
I don't like strong smells.

666
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:49,230
So things like scallions, garlic, and pickled vegetables are absolutely not allowed in the fridge.

667
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,940
I understand. What goes in the fridge then?

668
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,190
Does he get full just by drinking water?

669
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,030
What if I use my skills to make a sumptuous banquet fit for an emperor

670
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,370
and he coolly says,

671
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:05,760
"I don't eat breakfast."

672
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:11,990
Then wouldn't I be like the U.S. president in the White House?
("In the White House" sounds like "doing work for nothing.")

673
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,870
As women of a new age, don't be fooled into guessing a man's preferences.

674
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,820
It doesn't matter what the boss likes to eat.

675
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,970
What matters is what I like to eat.

676
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,390
There must be vegetables.

677
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,640
There needs to be fish and meat!

678
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,270
It's okay if Boss looks down on me.

679
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:47,100
Only when I'm full will I have the energy to chase him.

680
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:08,710

♫ This is PiHai ♫

690
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,030
Beautiful serving plates!

691

697
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,190
Good morning, Boss.

698
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,250
I know, overbearing CEOs don't eat breakfast.

699
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,690
Even if they do eat breakfast, it has to be different from what's commonly served.

700
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:18,550
Common folk dishes like these are for me to eat.

701
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:24,260
Don't worry, I'll definitely clean up well after I eat.

702
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,980
I guarantee it will be so clean there won't be a speck of dust or hint of stench.

703
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,010
It will be just like new.

704
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,500
What are you doing?

705
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,400
I'm eating.

706
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,560
♫ Lost to you ♫

707
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:48,620

01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:08,440
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

712
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:30,220
Good morning, Boss.

713
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,920
I know, overbearing CEOs don't eat breakfast.

714
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,340
Even if they do eat breakfast, it has to be different from what's commonly served.

715
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,280
Common folk dishes like these are for me to eat.

716
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:49,930
Don't worry, I'll definitely clean up well after I eat.

717
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:53,660
I guarantee it will be so clean there won't be a speck of dust or hint of stench.

718
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,540
It will be just like new.

719
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,190
What are you doing?

720
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,720
I'm eating.

721
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,560
Don't you not eat these kinds of—

722
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,150
I hired you. I'm paying for it.

723
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:10,020
This is my place. Of course the breakfast is also mine.

724
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,970
Get the rice.

725
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,090
Okay.

726
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,260
Get the rice.

727
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,070
Chopsticks.

728
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,060
Yes.

729
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,620
I'll bite the bullet and give these common folk dishes a try.

730
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,510
I used low heat and my true feelings to slowly fry and roll that up.

731
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:29,520
With patience, it was removed from the heat right on the verge of becoming crisp.

732
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,210
Even if you don't savor the aftertaste, that's fine.

733
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,220
But you're actually swallowing it in one bite?

734
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,350
Tomatoes are the soul of a salad.

735
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,100
There's a spoon, but you won't use it.

736
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,990
You're just gulping it down in two sips.

737
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:50,960
Are you worthy of my soup?

738
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,930
CEOs eat breakfast too.

739
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:22,240
He only left a piece of tomato for me.

740
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,610
You monster!

741
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,930
What's wrong?

742
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,180
You're in a good mood today.

743
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,860
Am I?

744
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,990
It's a feeling.

745
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:50,670
I realized you're not wrong.

746
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,110
Place your enemy under 24-hour surveillance right before your eyes.

747
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:57,600
That's the best strategy.

748
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,720
Is Xiao'en still alive?

749
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,240
Where has your mind gone to?

750
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,080
Isn't torturing Xiao'en what put you in a good mood?

751
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,290
Am I perverted?

752
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,810
CEO!

753
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,480
♫ Lost to you ♫

754
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,610
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

I realized you're not wrong.

759
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,460
Place your enemy under 24-hour surveillance right before your eyes.

760
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,780
That's the best strategy.

761
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,980
Is Xiao'en still alive?

762
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,420
Where has your mind gone to?

763
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,920
Isn't torturing Xiao'en what put you in a good mood?

764
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,610
Am I perverted?

765
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,960
CEO!

766
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,890
I'm sorry. How did I do this again?

767
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:48,360
It's fine. I'm here.

768
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:53,370
How did an employee who can't even walk properly get into our company?

769
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,060
Doesn't our company have a physical exam?

770
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,100
No.

771
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,880
I must bring it up at our next meeting.

772
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,470
To enter the company, you must be able to run at least 400 meters.

773
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,320
Good morning, CEO.

774
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,700
Good morning.

775
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,130
Good morning.

776
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,270
Good morning, CSO.

777
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,490
Why are you looking for the CEO?

778
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,300
I baked these cookies.

779
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,590
I promised you last time that I would bake them again.

780
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:25,020
I hope you don't dislike them.

781
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,040
Where's Zheng Xiao'en? If she's not stuck in North Korea acting in Crash Landing on You (lit. "Love's Emergency Landing"),

782
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,570
how can she helplessly watch those two act in Love's Cookie at the company?

783
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:50,070
That's right, Xiao'en. Why aren't you at work yet?

784
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,970
What? Xiao'en got fired?

785
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,460
Why?

786
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,210
I heard the downstairs security guard say that yesterday,

787
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:15,280
the CEO angrily roared at Xiao'en, "You are fired!"

788
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,760
- I also heard...
- What?

789
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,300
Xiao'en's firing had something to do with Chuchu.

790
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,690
What?

791
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,570
This woman is poisonous.

792
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:37,250
That's right.

793
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,640
Our Xiao'en charged ahead.

794
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,810
Hurry up and smile.

795
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,210
Why should I smile?

796
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:49,610
Be careful, or you'll be the next one she poisons.

797
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:01,050
I didn't eat the grilled fish.

798
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:05,200
I didn't eat the egg either.

799
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,400
I didn't drink the soup either.

800
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,160
Had I known earlier, I would've cooked an extra bowl of rice to eat with fermented tofu.

801
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,400
I'm so hungry.

802
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:43,070
Whoever treats me to a good meal right now,

803
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,540
I'll call them Dad.

804
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,110
Hello?

805
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,800
Dad!

806
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,730
♫ I'm not being roundabout with my silence ♫

807
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,060
I'm going home to eat today.

808
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,770
There's something really interesting at home.

809
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:14,600
Don't think you can use an affectionate gaze to steal my melon.

810
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,970
Everything that sets you apart from others is what I want.

811
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:22,040
CEO Situ, the deluxe mountain view suite at the penthouse is ready.

812
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,700
Xiao'en, you'll stay here, right?

813
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,600
You're not allowed to sneak away when I'm asleep.

814
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,630
I'll sleep here.

815
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,560
I promise I won't go anywhere.

816
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,560
♫ Meeting just to separate, embracing just to let go ♫

817
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,690
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

818
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,720
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

819
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:55,260
♫ A quiet strike ♫

820
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,420
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

821
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,610
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

822
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:03,860
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

823
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:08,300
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

824
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,900
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

825
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,050
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

826
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:21,020
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

827
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:25,720
♫ If I could see you again ♫

828
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:32,380
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

829
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:36,530
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

830
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:44,650
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

831
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:49,480
♫ If you were a painter ♫

832
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,490
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

833
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:55,800
♫ No regrets ♫

834
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:01,960
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
