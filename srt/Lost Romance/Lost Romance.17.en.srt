Since our ship had practically no military equipment,

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,760
all of the ship’s crew immediately became very worried.

Even I, who was deep in my dreams, woke up suddenly due to the commotion.

I started writing letters to her

143
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,490
because I wanted to tell her

all about the places I had been to and the sceneries I had seen.

The novel was based on these love letters.

150
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,540
There would be an adventure to overcome obstacles at each place that he went to.

00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,220
Was it when the male lead boarded the ship for his return journey?

161
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,980
Yes. How did you know?

162
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:50,970
Anyway, I received news that Xiaoshuang had gotten engaged to the town mayor's son.

163
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,320
So you stopped writing?

164
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,070
Yes. I burnt the manuscript.

165
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,400
Burnt it?

166
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,880
In the end, Chen Qing finally found Liu Mushuang.

167
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,980
They planned to return to their country together.

168
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,370
Right at the moment when they set foot on their cruise,

169
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,780
flames colored the entire sky red.

170
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,690
Everything that was before their eyes

171
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,490
seemed like it was burning.

172
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,790
You're so irresponsible!

173
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,250
So what if you were heartbroken?

174
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,480
What did Chen Qing from the book do wrong?

175
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,020
You are already on the last chapter.

176
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,330
Can't you finish writing and give him a proper ending?

177
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,180
Why do you have to make Chen Qing in the novel suffer just because you're suffering?

178
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,350
I can't write anymore.

179
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,830
This book is my love letter.

180
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,740
There is no longer a recipient for the love letter.

181
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,490
What's the point in continuing to write it?

182
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,410
Mister, it's already the last chapter!

183
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,750
Anyway, I didn't come to sue you.

184
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,140
It's just that the stories are too similar.

185
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,880
I don't know where you got this story,

186
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,660
but they are my heartbroken memories after all.

187
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,080
If possible, I'd like for you guys to take this book off the shelves.

188
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,600
Mister, listen to me.

189
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,770
Finish the story, publish the novel,

190
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,660
make a bunch of money, and buy that ship.

191
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,820
Show that Xiaoshuang!

192
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,960
I don't want to show off to Xiaoshuang.

193
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,530
I want her to be happy.

194
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,030
That is the right attitude.

195
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,430
Since you haven't finished writing it,

196
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,920
there is still an opportunity to write a happy ending.

197
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,260
Look at how precious these letters are,

198
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,450
how real these feelings were.

199
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,800
Even if you don't confess with these,

200
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,190
they are still your genuine feelings.

201
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,260
How was Harry Potter written?

202
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,190
It was the light at the end of the tunnel for a single mother at her darkest hour.

203
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,560
And all these adventures are your treasures.

204
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,090
If you give up so easily,

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,230
don't you think it is a pity?

206
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,010
It is the first time someone tells me this.

207
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,820
Do you think there are many authors who personally sailed the five oceans?

208
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,880
Do you think there are many authors who are this full of emotion?

209
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,480
Do you think there are many authors with such a wild imagination?

210
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,040
So you can do it! Really!

211
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,010
You have to write it.

212
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,480
I'm begging you to write it well

213
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,050
so that Chen Qing can be happy.

214
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,080
Our publishing company will definitely publish this book for you.

215
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,750
What do you mean publish it?

216
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,750
I already rejected the proposal to appeal to the male market last time.

217
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,480
We can't even handle the female market.

218
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,520
Why would we appeal to the male market?

219
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,990
Chief Editor, there was someone called Huang Yi in Hong Kong.

220
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,050
Everyone told him that the market for wuxia (martial arts) novels was already declining.

221
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,630
But, against expectations, he started his own publishing company

222
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,980
to publish his own wuxia novels.

223
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,300
So you are going to start your own publishing company?

224
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,580
What Xiao’en meant was we can be the talent scout.

225
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,190
When everyone is doubting us—

226
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,960
It means that stuff is bad.

227
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,090
We have to follow the trend and move towards a good place.

228
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,860
A good publishing company has to expand their genres in a timely manner.

229
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,580
That's why I've never boasted that we're a good publishing company.

230
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,830
We are a small publishing company.

231
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,850
Okay, don't say anymore. No one will take on a business deal that loses money.

232
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,990
No means no.

233
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,940
You guys think I’ve never been young before?

234
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,910
Hey!

235
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,120
I used to be very passionate.

236
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,840
I also had ambitions and ideals for the publishing industry.

237
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,600
But my dreams were eaten by reality in the end.

238
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,980
A tough man like me

239
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,580
still ended up as the chief editor of romance novels.

240
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,400
We've already lost money on the last book.

241
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,360
Can you guarantee that this book will make a profit?

242
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,930
You can't just do whatever you want at the company.

243
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,510
I'm responsible for everyone's salaries, including both of yours.

244
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:35,690
If the company shuts down, how will I face everyone, including you two?

245
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,240
Then, let's think about other ways.

246
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
After all, the publishing company is not ours alone.

247
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,620
You know, I used to bottle everything inside.

248
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,700
Every time my boss made an unreasonable request,

249
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,800
even though I thought it was really stupid,

250
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,300
I just thought... why couldn't we communicate?

251
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,120
Maybe he would listen to my suggestions.

252
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,180
If he's a boss with a brain.

253
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,190
Chief Editor, let me discuss with you.

254
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,380
I understand your worries.

255
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,420
But what if I can think of a way to break even first?

256
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,010
Before this book is published,

257
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,670
whether it’s pulling in sponsorships, selling advertisements, or selling merchandise,

258
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,450
I’ll try everything to earn the cost back first.

259
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,320
It won't affect your regular work?

260
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,930
Yes, I will work overtime.

261
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:45,370
If I do this, can we publish this book using this company's name?

262
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,810
You really want to publish this book this badly?

263
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,160
Yes. This book is very important to me.

264
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,780
I can also work overtime.

265
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,550
I know that talking about its great significance

266
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,060
makes me sound like an eighth grader (early teen with delusions of grandeur).

267
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,530
But it was not easy to find this author.

268
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,350
I really can't give up.

269
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,290
Please, Chief Editor.

270
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,500
Please.

271
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,790
Fine. I won't ask that this book earn a profit.

272
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,490
As long as it doesn't lose money, we will publish it.

273
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,610
- Thank you, Chief Editor!
- You are the human Bodhisattva.

274
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,020
- The Buddha reborn.
- You're our great benefactor.

275
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,160
Enough. Hurry and get back to work.

276
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,450
Go. Go.

277
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,430
Thank you, Chief Editor.

278
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,910
Enough. Go.

279
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,640
[Ruge Publishing]

280
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,350
How was it?

281
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,290
This is the list of vendors who rejected the business department.

282
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,220
They said we are more than welcome to try it ourselves.

283
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,460
I will go there now.

284
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,730
Wait. Drink something first.

285
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,160
Do you have a plan for the ad inserts in the book?

286
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,500
The client said they would consider it, but we don't have enough physical channels.

287
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,410
I'm going to get in touch with various convenience stores.

288
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,160
But the procurement process for convenience stores is really difficult.

289
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,550
But if we close the deal, our publishing company will have secured a basic sales market.

290
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,460
I think you have changed.

291
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,890
How?

292
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,520
You are more positive and courageous than before.

293
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,430
In the past, you wouldn't have lasted more than five seconds with Chief Editor Yao.

294
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,960
Could it be that CEO, You're So Naughty is actually some spiritual growth class?

295
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,330
Some things you just shouldn't think too much about.

296
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,270
Just hurry up and do what you feel like doing.

297
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,020
I like you, so I have to let you know.

298
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,940
Say it again.

299
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,880
I like you.

300
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,290
Again.

301
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,060
I like you.

302
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,070
Senior Xiao'en, look into my eyes.

303
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,750
The Xiao'en of yesterday is as if she died yesterday.

304
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,360
The Xiao'en of today is as if she was born today.

305
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,310
What are you saying?

306
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,150
I'm saying we should get back to work.

307
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,460
We don't care for a CEO who isn't ours.

308
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,290
A conscientious woman is most beautiful.

309
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,340
There has to be a CEO who will be for me.

310
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,050
That's right. I don't need to think fondly back to the CEO every day.

311
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,140
Compared to the past when I didn't know what I could do,

312
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,530
at least I have a direction to go in now.

313
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,140
Next, I just need to run towards my goal.

314
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,380
I feel so much better now.

315
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,460
Goodbye, CEO.

316
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,180
Goodbye, CEO.

317
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,890
The police contacted us.

318
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,340
When the CEO recovers a bit more,

319
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,030

Gossip?

331

I heard that all the big publishing companies are fighting over it.

If we can get him first—

Who is it?

336

Do you really need to ask? He Tianxing, of course!

Have you been living under a rock?

339

Ever since Tianliang Group's CEO He Tianxing woke up after falling off a building,

340
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,440
his popularity exploded.

341
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,790
Be it his bizarre history or handsome appearance, they are all hot topics.

342
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:03,220
Do you know which piece of news had the highest click-through rate last week?

343
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,730
He Tianxing's cane

344
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,010
hit a tree on the street.

345
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,750
The day after that news broke,

346
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,120
everyone got out their cameras to take a picture of that tree.

347
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,890
The point is, he's very popular right now.

348
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,290
Anything related to him will definitely break click-through rate records.

349
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,250
So?

350
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,860
So as long as we get He Tianxing,

351
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,270
regardless of whether we publish an autobiography, a photo book, a finance book,

352
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,020
or even just a piece of paper, it's all good.

353
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,130
If we can get He Tianxing, it is just like getting a money tree.

Tree.

Chief Editor, I also want you to help you earn this money,

356
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:04,250
but there's this very small misunderstanding between He Tianxing and me.

357
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,790
I'm afraid it wouldn't be appropriate to see him again.

358
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,530
I'm afraid it'd be like an ant trying to shake a tree or a praying mantis trying to stop a car with its arm.

No. It has not been extinguished yet.

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,000
[CEO, You're So Naughty]

638
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,450
Let's go with your questions.

639
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,640
Why does a publishing company that publishes romance novels

640
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,890
want to publish my autobiography?

641
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,650
To many women, the existence of you, He Tianxing, is God’s praise.

642
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:47,220
Our publishing company serves these women.

643
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,320
We’ll painstakingly peel off your every layer

644
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,030
so that the hearts and souls of many women can get spiritual comfort.

645
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,010
Tell me the truth.

646
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,890
The market for romance novels is in a slump.

647
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,450
Our company is not making any money.

648
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,640
Whoever interviews you will have an increased volume of sales.

649
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,280
I wouldn't have had the chance to do this,

650
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,700
but I have a book I really want to publish.

651
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:17,180
The chief editor said if I could get the company's cashflow to net zero through you,

652
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,010
then I can fulfill my dream.

653
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,320
I can accept this reason.

654
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,670
Have a seat.

655
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,900
I’ve received your interview outline.

656
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,460
I think that’s probably the official manuscript.

657
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,230
Privately, you probably have other ideas.

658
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:53,050
Actually, my true plan is "one hundred ways to be friends with He Tianxing."

659
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,510
The autobiography will allow people who like He Tianxing to...

660
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:03,890
What I meant was, the information that everyone should know about you

661
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,390
can be obtained from the newspapers and magazines.

662
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,520
Since that’s the case, can we change to a more interesting way or—

663
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,970
A slightly more... personal topic.

664
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,490
Yes.

665
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,000
It’s not that it’s not possible.

666
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,300
But... I have a condition.

667
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,630
What condition?

668
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,660
For every question you ask me, you’ll have to answer a question of mine.

669
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,210
What?

670
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,230
If that’s not possible, then we’ll just treat this as official business.

671
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,890
It's possible, it's possible!

672
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,230
They're just questions.

673
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,990
Even if you had asked me not to eat ice for the whole summer, that wouldn't be a problem.

674
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,270
Bring it on.

675
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,360
Okay, I'll go first.

676
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,290
Zheng Xiao'en, how old are you?

677
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,000
Huh?

678
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,760
In order to get to know another person, you have to start from the basic information.

679
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:05,320
I'm 28. What about you?

680
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,340
I'm 32.

681
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,880
Then, on the internet, it’s said that you’ve gone on dates with a mixed-race female model—

682
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,750
One question in exchange for another question.

683
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,040
I didn't ask yet.

684
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,400
You did. You asked how old I was.

685
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,450
My turn. How long have you worked at your current company?

686
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,140
Six years. What about—

687
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,780
On the internet, it’s said that you’ve gone on dates with a mixed-race female model.

688
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,560
Is that the type of women you like?

689
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,430
Do you think that the things written on the internet can be believed?

690
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,470
No.

691
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,930
My turn. What’s the most miraculous thing that has ever happened to you?

692
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,890
Wait. Did you answer my question?

693
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,210
I asked whether the things on the internet can be believed. You said no.

694
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,590
You still haven’t answered my question. The most miraculous thing.

695
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,250
Meeting Situ Aoran and you.

696
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,680
One day, I was on the road and saw a robbery.

697
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,370
In broad daylight, the thief forcibly pulled the necklace off an old lady’s neck.

698
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,520
I thought it was very scary.

699
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,750
My turn.

700
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,150
If a mixed-race female model is not your type,

701
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,970
have you ever thought about what type of girl can attract your attention?

702
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,600
No.

703
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,540
I’ve asked a question that’s too conservative?

704
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,150
My turn.

705
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,960
When you saw me for the first time,

706
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,890
what’s the first thought that flashed through your mind?

707
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,820
Handsome.

708
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,750
I meant after you woke up—

709
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,830
Hey, you already finished asking your question.

710
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,810
It's my turn.

711
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:18,710
You have to describe in detail the appearance of the ideal woman in your eyes.

712
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,950
This time, you’ll have to describe it at length.

713
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,960
Interacting with her makes me feel comfortable.

714
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,420
That's all?

715
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,890
That's all.

716
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:36,040
After you woke up and you saw me for the first time,

717
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,770
what’s the first thought that flashed through your mind?

718
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,160
- Really handsome.
- That’s not it.

719
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,220
It is.

720
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,120
Will thinking that the other person is handsome make you want to hug that person and cry?

721
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,870
♫ This is a fairytale, why shed tears? ♫

722
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:59,520
♫ Just like our love which was not looked favorably upon ♫

723
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:07,770
♫ Your kiss goodbye on my forehead is like being stranded forever ♫

724
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,570
I finally found you.

725
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:13,010
I finally found you.

726
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,700
You've already asked two questions. It's my turn.

727
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,010
Everyone knows that your family composition is quite complicated.

728
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:26,310
Has such a background affected you?

729
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,380
Of course there’s an effect.

730
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,830
- That is...
- You have no choice in whether you’re born or not.

731
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:39,700
It’s not my place to comment on my parents and their affairs.

732
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,850
The only thing I can do is to continuously do my best and run forward.

733
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,060
In the current environment, I have to do my best to not fall short.

734
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,010
I have to use better results to prove myself.

735
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,790
You said he's an illegitimate child.

736
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:01,330
Although his family would have provided him with a lot of resources,

737
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,760
his brother and sister certainly would have been better off.

738
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:09,100
The mother wouldn't give him much support.

739
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,130
His father values him only because he's capable.

740
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,810
Only by staying at the top does his life have value.

741
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,160
Isn't this tragic?

742
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,780
Perhaps being in a coma

743
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,890
is the only way he can truly be himself again.

744
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,380
If you could choose, would you want to wake up?

745
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,440
What kind of question is that?

746
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,380
You're the one who said,

747
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,700
"In a storm, you have to be like an adult."

748
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,730
"In beautiful weather, you have to be like a child."

749
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:57,460
By constantly working hard, doesn’t it mean that you think that you’re always in a storm?

750
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,480
If your life only has value when you stay at the top,

751
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,540
if you work hard on all your goals for the sake of other people,

752
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:09,460
then what meaning does your own existence have?

753
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,130
You asked an extra question.

754
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,610
Why don’t you tell me about your family situation?

755
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:26,200
My family situation?

756
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,200
It’s very simple. My family has one member. Me.

757
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,430
What do you mean?

758
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:39,550
I don't have a dad, a mom, nor any siblings.

759
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,990
I'm not lying.

760
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,690
I was abandoned at a park.

761
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,430
I grew up at an orphanage.

762
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,490
Which orphanage?

763
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,510
Yongxin Orphanage.

764
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:00,470
But it doesn’t exist anymore. It closed down.

765
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,070
I really couldn't tell.

766
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:07,690
Of course. This is not a matter worth broadcasting.

767
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,240
If it were you, would you like it if everyone looked at you with sympathy

768
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,040
or the feeling of not knowing what to do to make things better?

769
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:22,030
Indeed, I wouldn’t like it.

770
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,860
Wait a moment. Who should be the one asking the next question?

771
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,280
- I’m confused.
- I think it’s me.

772
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,970
That can’t be. You asked me about my family situation just now.

773
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,560
But you also asked me whether I would like it if everyone looked at me with sympathetic expressions.

774
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,590
That counts as a question?

775
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,620
Yes.

776
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,230
Thank you for accepting the interview today.

777
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,000
Next time, I’ll work harder.

778
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,970
Zheng Xiao'en.

779
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,940
♫ See you around, will you miss me? ♫

780
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,520
♫ Don't miss home too much when it's time to party ♫

781
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,850
♫ And I'm leaving home ♫

782
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:43,390
♫ Don't think it's where I belong ♫

783
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,810
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

784
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:52,890
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

785
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:59,370
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

786
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,950
Thank you for accepting the interview today.

787
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,580
Next time, I’ll work harder.

788
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,480
Zheng Xiao'en.

789
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,920
I have a feeling that you and I...

790
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,990
CEO.

791
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,920
Chuchu?

792
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:46,420
I finally get to see you.

793
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,160
She is?

794
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,300
I’ll go first. See you tomorrow.

795
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,250
See you tomorrow.

796
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,740
I've been really worried about you,

797
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,890
but back when you were at the hospital,

798
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:07,030
Sister Shanna would never let me go in to see you.

799
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:18,550
Does our promise back then still count?

800
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,490
Didn't I tell you that it's my late mother's birthday today?

801
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,270
The chairman organized a very important meeting.

802
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:30,260
If you don't show up, the directors who are close to He Mingli and He Tianjian definitely won't let you off easy.

803
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,130
Leave.

804
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,590
Tianxing.

805
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:40,520
Just leave. Let me have some peace and quiet.

806
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,470
CEO.

807
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:06,700
You're... from the Secretary's Office?

808
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,270
Why are you crying?

809
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,250
My father passed away yesterday.

810
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:18,080
Why didn't you take time off if your father passed away?

811
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,970
I didn't dare to.

812
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:30,370
Shanna. Help... Ling Chuchu arrange for time off for a week.

813
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:37,860
In the past, my dad often said that he would take me to see a sunrise,

814
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:43,210
but we were never able to go because of work.

815
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:47,990
Every time, he would say, "We'll go next time for sure."

816
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:54,190
Who knew there would never be a next time?

817
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,700
That's how life is.

818
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:05,290
For some people, when you want to celebrate their birthday,

819
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,540
the opportunity disappears forever instead.

820
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,520
Let's see a sunrise together next time.

821
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,980
I'm sorry.

822
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:22,520
I just feel like you also really need to see a sunrise.

823
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,900
Let's go if we have the chance.

824
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,470
Since you suddenly got into an accident,

825
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:40,970
I just want to know if our promise still counts.

826
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:46,590
I know, I'm not talking about now.

827
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,720
Things are different now.

828
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,910
A lot of things have happened.

829
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:56,310
I just want to confirm whether you're still

830
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,980
the same person who encouraged and protected me.

831
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,260
Not Tianliang's CEO,

832
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:06,860
but just He Tianxing.

833
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,630
♫ Lost to you ♫

834
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:20,800
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

835
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,740
♫ If you were a painter ♫

836
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:27,030
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

837
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:33,160
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

838
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:39,600
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

839
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,270
I think Cheng Qing mailed that to us.

840
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,900
I think so too, but I don't know if he likes it or not.

841
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,990
It's hard to say.

842
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:52,670
Good. This is a really good beginning.

843
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,230
Cheng Qing really is a hidden gem.

844
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:59,020
Have him continue to write the rest of the story. Make it fast.

845
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,360
What are you laughing at?

846
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,810
As a dutiful chief editor of romances,

847
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:06,340
I shouldn't be reading these types of novels to begin with.

848
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,590
Yes, yes, yes.

849
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:08,860
You're totally right, Chief Editor.

850
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,950
Hurry up and discuss how we're going to publish He Tianxing's autobiography.

851
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:14,800
What method will we be using, and where will it be released?

852
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,310
We thought of a few approaches.

853
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,800
"The CEO's fifty secrets."

854
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,300
"I have a date with the CEO."

855
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,970
"Those years, the CEO we chased after together."
(Reference to the Taiwanese film You Are the Apple of My Eye)

856
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,910
"There has to be a CEO out there who suits you."

857
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,860
We weren't planning on finding a PR company at first,

858
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,090
but because we're publishing a book for He Tianxing,

859
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:41,970
a lot of PR companies have been contacting us to collaborate in mutual benefit.

860
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:44,000
Zheng Xiao'en, stop laughing.

861
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,030
Sorry, I can't stop.

862
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,930
What's wrong with Zheng Xiao'en?

863
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,890
Is she under too much pressure from work?

864
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:51,050
I didn't exploit her too much, did I?

865
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:53,440
Does she need to take some time off?

866
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:58,210
It's nothing. Sorry.

867
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,520
Chief Editor, can someone else handle the interviews with He Tianxing?

868
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,080
This...

869
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,340
Let me switch with you.

870
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,250
Let me handle contacting the inside front cover's designer and the printing press.

871
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,680
That works, right? That works, right?

872
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,090
You were the one who secured this interview.

873
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:12,790
That works, right?

874
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,770
Okay.

875
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,240
My goodness. I've laughed so hard my stomach hurts.

876
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,810
Zheng Xiao'en, what's going on with you?

877
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,110
Nothing much.

878
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:40,060
There is something. Anytime He Tianxing is mentioned, you...

879
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:51,140
I thought I already passed over the CEO and went straight to business.

880
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,720
It turns out I didn't.

881
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,990
It turns out I couldn't.

882
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,670
What's wrong?

883
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,630
I already know that Situ Aoran is Situ Aoran

884
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,560
and that He Tianxing is He Tianxing.

885
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:19,020
But when I went to conduct the interview,

886
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:25,190
I couldn't help but try to find

887
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,020
traces of Situ Aoran on He Tianxing.

888
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,430
From the moment I asked him if he was afraid of the dark,

889
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:39,360
wasn't that a form of not letting go?

890
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:47,680
He said he wasn't afraid, and I was hurt.

891
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,920
But what if he said he was afraid?

892
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:57,420
I would think, "That's right! You are Situ Aoran!"

893
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,960
"You just don't know it."

894
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,650
When he was talking about his past,

895
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:24,110
I couldn't help but make comparisons with Situ Aoran's life experiences.

896
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:28,390
When he was asking about my personal information,

897
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:32,410
I wondered if he took an interest in me.

898
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:36,450
When he was walking me out, I even thought that

899
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:39,970
maybe we'd still have a chance.

900
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,830
And then Chuchu appeared,

901
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:51,110
reminding me that real life is real life.

902
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,480
I feel like I'm so pitiful for overthinking things.

903
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:04,150
Who knew that there would also be a Chuchu in real life?

904
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:07,940
Aoran dreamt about her before.

905
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:13,970
She presented He Tianxing with a thousand paper cranes on behalf of the company.

906
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,690
I thought she was just called Chuchu as well.

907
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:23,230
Who knew that

908
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:27,930
this Chuchu would be the same Chuchu?

909
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:39,270
That's why I really can't go anymore. Really.

910
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,380
I can't go anymore.

911
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,250
CEO, if I win,

912
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,520
can I make a wish to have a pair of cufflinks you wear often?

913
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,960
It’s like watching live streamers compete through a screen.

914
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,720
I don't even have the qualifications to donate to them.

915
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,400
I'm a complete outsider.

916
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,920
Why didn't you show up as promised?

917
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,220
I trusted you, yet you chose to run away just as we were getting started.

918
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:16,820
If you’re such an irresponsible person,

919
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,410
I'll be very disappointed.

920
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:21,400
I used to think that we were people from different worlds,

921
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,390
but the more I come to understand you,

922
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:28,640
the more I feel that you're not that far out of reach after all.

923
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,650
Didn't I say that as long as I reach out my hand,

924
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,910
I must be able to touch you?

925
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,800
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

926
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,910
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

927
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:58,890
♫ A quiet strike ♫

928
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,590
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

929
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,890
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,990
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

932
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,990
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

933
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:21,190
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

934
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:26,190
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

935
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:30,890
♫ If I could see you again ♫

936
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:37,590
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

937

938
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:50,890
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:54,660
♫ If you were a painter ♫

940
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,760
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

941
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,060
♫ No regrets ♫

942
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:06,860
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
