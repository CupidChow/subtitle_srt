You know everyone's comparing me to He Tianxing and contradicting me,

Think about what the employees on strike will think.

They'll think that the CHRO is willing to talk with them,

Perfect. I'll take that one.

127

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,570
Excuse me. You said how many zeroes after the five?

130

Four.

131
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,950

132
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,040
can it be cheaper? A zero less?

Do you want to try the hot spring, spa, or hydrotherapy?

138

I heard the dinner is quite a treat.

139
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,140

140
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,930
Of course.

Then I'll let you both rest.

146
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,010

150
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,300
I spent so much money. I just want to look around.

151
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,690
But this whole floor is booked.

152
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,150
I won't go in the rooms.

153
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,360
Looking around the hallways is also very interesting.

154
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,370
Look, being alone in happiness is better than sharing my happiness.

158
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,660
Don't worry about me. You can get back to work.

159
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,330
No, but you'll disturb the other guests—

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:28,640
If you don't make a sound and I don't make a sound, then no one will be disturbed. Okay?

161
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,660
No, but—

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,660
Miss, please do me a favor.

163
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,390
You're making this hard for me.

164
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,990
What's wrong?

165
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,660
CEO.

166
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,490
I slipped in the bathroom and broke the mirror.

167
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,200
It's alright. Let me look.

168
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm bleeding.

169
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,190
Hey, go help!

170
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,930
Hurry!

171
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,230
I absolutely won't give you guys the chance to perform the finger-sucking scene!

172
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,720
Her room's mirror broke, and she hurt her hand.

173
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,740
I'll bring the first aid kit immediately and have someone come clean up the room.

174
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,790
Can you just get a new room for her?

175
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,940
I'm sorry. The last room was just booked.

176
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,340
We really don't have any more.

177
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,940
It'll hurt a bit. Try to hold it in.

178
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,230
Here.

179
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,760
CEO Situ, the deluxe mountain view suite at the penthouse is ready.

180
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,600
Okay, I got it.

181
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,890
Didn't you say the hotel was completely booked?

182
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:32,400
Well, actually... one woman who booked had something come up and decided to cancel.

183
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,730
CEO, I can just stay here.

184
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,180
We are here to work.

185
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,020
Alright, I'm fine either way.

186
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,290
My room is farther from here.

187
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,160
Call me if anything happens, okay?

188
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,010
Okay.

189
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,670
I should have brought a tent.

190
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,960
Tonight is the turning point in the plot.

191
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,460
The author will use any method beyond reason

192
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,290
to trap the main characters in the same room overnight.

193
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,090
If that's the case, what's the use of sacrificing my own room?

194
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,000
In any case, if they get drunk, they'll get in the wrong bed.

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,740
If there's an earthquake, they will cuddle.

196
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,290
If one goes to the other's room to talk about work at night,

197
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,700
the lock will definitely break and they'll be trapped.

198
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,480
But in this world, where am I, the only person who can split them up?

199
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,660
I am everywhere!

200
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,260
Just not in this resort.

201
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,930
The thousands of romance novels I've read are all for nothing.

202
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,190
I'm already frustrated enough, yet you bugs are still here making all this noise.

203
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,440
- Miss!
- I'm looking for someone!

204
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,580
You can't go in if you're not staying here, Miss!

205
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,690
You can't go in if you didn't reserve a room, Miss!

206
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,000
If you keep doing this, I'll call the cops. Miss!

207
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,940
Miss! Don't be like this!

208
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,550
Give me a bit more time!

209
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,000
You... can't!

210
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,260
You can't enter!

211
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,430
I know.

212
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,740
[Sauna (Men)]

213
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,400
Miss!

214
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,550
You can't come in here. I will call the cops!

215
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,950
I found the person I was looking for!

216
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,590
Miss! Miss!

217
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,770
Supreme Master Qingfeng, I'm with you, right?

218
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,950
Use this.

219
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,630
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

220
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,970
You said something along the lines of "Timing's not important. We'll see each other next time."

221
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,950
That is what I think.

222
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,570
So did a criminal barge into your house and force you to come to the hot springs at gunpoint?

223
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,600
No.

224
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,550
I really didn't plan on coming.

225
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,660
Aoran is a very good friend of mine.

226
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,830
I don't want to sabotage him.

227
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,440
But I don't know why...

228
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,990
When I was driving to work in the morning...

229
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,410
I thought about when I drove Chuchu back to the company that night...

230
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,570
Suddenly, you felt happy from the bottom of your heart.

231
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,430
When you came back to your senses, you realized you were already on your way to the resort.

232
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,930
Right?

233
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,850
How did you know?

234
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,190
Because... this is love.

235
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,230
Love doesn't have any reason.

236
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,010
I also think there are no reasons behind my actions.

237
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,380
I must have come here with the thought

238
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,550
that no matter what happens between Aoran and Chuchu,

239
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,420
I want to see it for myself.

240
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,410
Then maybe I can give up.

241
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,350
It's useless for a kind guy like you to come here.

242
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,640
You're not destructive at all.

243
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,090
You can only watch helplessly and silently give them your blessings as they confirm each other's feelings.

244
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm not that great.

245
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,390
You still don't understand yourself well enough.

246
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,090
What about you? Why are you here?

247
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,020
I'm here to change

248
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,550
(His) plans for me.

249
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,020
So you think destiny can be changed?

250
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,950
Of course! As long as we help each other.

251
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,050
Didn't you say I'm destined to silently give them my blessings?

252
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,250
Destiny is destiny, but we can still fight for what we want.

253
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,490
Feel what's in your heart.

254
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,990
Whomever you want to push forward for, you will fight for her.

255
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,820
You thought about Chuchu, so you came here at the turn of your steering wheel.

256
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,470
I thought about the overbearing CEO, so I moved my feet and came here.

257
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,270
Right?

258
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,410
What's wrong?

259
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,920
Sorry, I'm just an assistant.

260
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,740
I should have let you eat first.

261
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,880
From this day forward, I want to eat at the dining table too.

262
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,940
If you have a portion to eat, then so do I.

263
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,240
It's alright. Don't pay attention to that.

264
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,700
CEO, you're so kind!

265
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,900
Immature.

266
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,770
Wow, I didn't think duck and peach would go so well together.

267
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,130
Don't look.

268
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm not cute when I eat.

269
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,240
It's this taste!

270
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,390
Don't worry, you look better than someone else.

271
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,600
There's somewhere I want to go to later.

272
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Can you accompany me?

273
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,200
What's going on here?

274
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,280
Miss said you two are about to retire for the night and asked me to turn down the bed.

275
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,580
Is that not right?

276
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,410
Right! You're so right!

277
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,290
Your service is amazing.

278
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,330
When I check out, I will give you a five-star review.

279
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,030
I'll tell your boss to give you a raise.

280
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,000
Thank you. I hope you two have a great night.

281
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,970
Why are you looking at me like that?

282
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,780
Sometimes I really don't know if you are a genius or just an idiot.

283
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,220
You stopped Chuchu and Aoran from spending the night in the same room,

284
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,650
but why didn't you stop us from sharing a bed?

285
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,010
If I stopped this, I'd be out there as mosquito food instead!

286
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,330
Just think of this as military bunks.

287
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,560
Two soldiers' camaraderie.

288
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,040
Comrades helping one another out in the face of calamity.

289
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,340
Do you really have no sense of danger?

290
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,770
It's because I have such a strong sense of danger that I'm scared to take even a step away from the battlefield.

291
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,650
You must know, the main characters' relationship development happens in minutes.

292
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,710
Plus, I finally got into the resort.

293
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm absolutely not leaving!

294
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,250
Fine. Why don't I leave then?

295
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,590
I'll find another place to stay.

296
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,580
Oh no, you shouldn't.

297
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,840
That's not right.

298
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,430
Why am I the one who has to leave?

299
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,760
Hey, I booked this room.

300
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,630
Look!

301
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,060
How much farther?

302
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,170
The receptionist said there's a small stream in around twenty meters.

303
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,070
That's where all the fireflies are!

304
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,930
Do you want to see them that badly?

305
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:39,680
I heard the environment is very nice here, so there are a lot of fireflies.

306
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,390
As if a milky way is flowing right under our feet!

307
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,700
It must be beautiful!

308
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,000
Hey, hey!

309
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,770
Your bro Aoran is afraid of the dark.

310
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,010
His little hands are trembling already.

311
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,260
He's acting all tough in order to get the girl.

312
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,530
You don't know what he experienced in the past.

313
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,150
Don't make sarcastic remarks like this.

314
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,900
CEO, do you hear it?

315
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,490
- Hear what?
- The sound of water.

316
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,270
It must be around here somewhere.

317
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,220
Where are you going?

318
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,260
To look for fireflies.

319
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,390
I heard they hide under the leaves.

320
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,180
Have you found them?

321
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:16,230
No. I think maybe our light's too bright, so they're hiding.

322
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,000
Can we turn off the light?

323
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,930
Can't we?

324
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,000
Okay, I'll turn it off.

325
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,700
Love is so powerful.

326
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,500
All the lights at home have to be on,

327
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,010
but now he can turn off the lights in the woods to see fireflies with his darling.

328
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,920
CEO, look.

329
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,620
Over there!

330
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,990
It's great. So beautiful.

331
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,930
Why did you suddenly—

332
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,130
It's too late. Let's go back.

333
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,960
Are you okay?

334
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm fine.

335
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,970
There are a lot of mosquitoes out here. Let's get going.

336
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,430
I wondered if we'd be able to save money on buying light bulbs if we collected enough fireflies.

337
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,820
But all the fireflies I caught ended up dead in the bag the next day.

338
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,090
How could I be so stupid? Fireflies are very fragile.

339
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,820
And they are very pitiful like this.

340
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,480
I won't do it again.

341
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,730
I really need to think about how next time, I can—

342
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,350
Careful.

343
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,900
How about I carry the light?

344
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,030
It's okay. You walk behind me. It's safer that way.

345
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,830
You allow your subordinates to blatantly bully their coworkers at work?

346
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,030
You're treating me as a chauffeur?
(He refers to himself as "shaoye" which means "young master")

347
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,020
Go back to your room.

348
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,480
Let's go.

349
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,140
Let's go! Or else we won't be able to keep up.

350
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,340
What's the point of chasing?

351
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,130
True love can give him courage.

352
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,170
What can I give him?

353
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,140
What do you want to give him?

354
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,300
Didn't we come to ruin their relationship?

355
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,000
Why are you worrying about Aoran instead?

356
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,940
There's some over there too!

357
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,290
CEO, I'll go catch some for you to see.

358
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,190
No, it's okay!

359
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,260
Did you hear that?

360
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,950
It seems like...

361
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,320
Help!

362
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,980
Help me! Help!

363
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,750
Help! Help!

364
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,260
- Help!
- Grab tight!

365
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,450
Help!

366
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,450
Help!

367
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,970
CEO! CEO!

368
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,960
Aoran! Chuchu!

369
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,240
What happened?

370
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,060
Situ Aoran.

371
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,480
Situ Aoran, wake up! Situ Aoran!

372
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,880
Hurry and call an ambulance!

373
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,410
♫ Lost to you ♫

374
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:54,110
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

375
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,410
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

376
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:03,540
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

377
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:10,030
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

378
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,950
Help!

379
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,000
Help me! Help!

380
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,430
Help! Help!

381
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,210
- Help!
-Grab tight!

382
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,630
Help!

383
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,960
Help!

384
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,680
CEO! CEO!

385
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,440
Aoran! Chuchu!

386
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,910
What happened?

387
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,600
Situ Aoran.

388
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,570
Situ Aoran, wake up! Situ Aoran!

389
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,990
Hurry and call an ambulance!

390
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,700
Situ Aoran.

391
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,050
Can you hear me? Situ Aoran.

392
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,710
Situ Aoran!

393
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,200
What did you say? Critical condition?

394
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,080
The hospital doctors are currently trying to save him, but the situation is not optimistic.

395
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,190
Where are you going?

396
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,680
You can drive a motorcycle, right?

397
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,150
- Can you take me somewhere?
- Yes, where?

398
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,320
The hospital!

399
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,910
Please come quickly!

400
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,070
Situ Aoran.

401
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,810
Situ Aoran, wake up! Situ Aoran!

402
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,590
Situ Aoran, can you hear me?

403
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,670
Situ Aoran. Situ Aoran!

404
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,870
- Zheng Xiao'en!
- Just hold on a little longer! Just a little longer!

405
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,990
The ambulance is already on the way!

406
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,230
Mom.

407
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,270
Mingli, your dad... he's...

408
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,250
Hold it in place.

409
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,670
- Dad!
- How could this happen?

410
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,970
This is an emergency procedure.

411
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,150
Family members of the patient, please wait outside.

412
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,510
Mom, calm down.

413
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,910
Prepare the electric shock.

414
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,880
[Charging to 200 joules]

415
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,710
Clear.

416
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,810
Set it to 250.

417
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,120
- Setting to 250.
- Clear.

418
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,250
Everyone, stop!

419
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,950
Can't you see that Zhaonan is suffering?

420
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,440
Don't stop!

421
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,590
Sis, look at Dad!

422
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,700
How can you bear to treat him like this?

423
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,460
No. I don't have the will.

424
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,100
Dad can't die yet!

425
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,120
He Mingli!

426
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,760
I don't care what methods you use.

427
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,210
My dad is not allowed to die!

428
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,850
Do something!

429
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,050
Put him onto the ECMO (life support).

430
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,180
Doctor, is he okay?

431
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,740
He had stopped breathing, but fortunately it was discovered early.

432
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,390
He's fine now.

433
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,910
Thank you, Doctor.

434
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,770
Careful.

435
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,580
It must hurt a lot.

436
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,820
It'll take some more effort to walk now.

437
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,930
You'll have to bear with it for a while.

438
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,310
I'm fine. I'm just worried about CEO.

439
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:57,210
If it weren't for me, he wouldn't have gotten hurt.

440
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,260
It seems like he'll wake up soon. Hurry, everyone get into position!

441
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,530
Hurry!

442
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,410
After almost experiencing death,

443
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,610
the first person he sees upon waking up should be the person that he longs for the most.

444
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,230
Hurry and sit.

445
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,440
But why are you here?

446
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,470
I came to upset the boss.

447
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,380
But now that he's become like this, I've suddenly become more compassionate.

448
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,770
What are you saying?

449
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,380
If you have some compassion for our CEO,

450
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,540
you must not tell him that I was here.

451
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,340
Otherwise, he'll definitely be really mad.

452
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,550
Promise? Promise!

453
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,240
I promise.

454
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,220
Okay. Look at him, not me!

455
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,460
You're awake.

456
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,930
Are you okay?

457
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,730
The person laying down is asking the sitting person if she's okay.

458
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,430
Of course he's never worried about himself.

459
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,000
He can only see the other person's tiny injury.

460
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,200
You brought me to the hospital?

461
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,460
Thank you.

462
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,200
I didn't expect that you'd save me.

463
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,080
I had thought that it would pass after I held on for a bit.

464
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,480
It's all my fault.

465
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,660
If I didn't try to be clever

466
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,440
and insist that we see the fireflies,

467
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,980
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

468
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,240
You never expected this, right?

469
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,980
A big man like me would be afraid of the dark.

470
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,070
Why are you afraid of the dark?

471
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,060
- When I was little, whenever I made a little mistake,
- Get inside!

472
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,350
- my dad would lock me in the cupboard.
- Dad, open the door.

473
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:40,130
- No matter how much I cried or pleaded, it was no use.
- Dad, open the door.

474
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,240
Sometimes I would be shut in for a whole day.

475
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,180
I wouldn't get any food or water.

476
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,910
The cupboard was so dark.

477
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,010
There wasn't even a little bit of light.

478
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:05,120
One time, Dad came in with a candle.

479
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,710
- Dad!
- I thought he knew I was afraid of the dark

480
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,500
and wanted to give me a light, but that wasn't the case.

481
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,740
Don't drip it on me.

482
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,930
Dad, don't drip it on me.

Why do you want to ruin my relationship with Chuchu?

644
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,010
Because I like you, okay? I like you!

645
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,270
♫ I lost to you ♫

646
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:53,570
♫ All of the innocent romance was lost to you ♫

647
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,140
♫ If you were a painter ♫

648
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,310
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

649
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,390
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

650
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:11,390
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

651
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:17,810
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

652
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,290
You went on a business trip, right?

653
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:24,420
That counts as a vacation for me, so I wanted to go out and have fun.

654
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,750
Going to a hot spring seemed fun...

655
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,120
And you happened to go to the hot spring resort that I was going to.

656
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,000
What exactly are you trying to do to Chuchu?

657
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,730
You think that I went there to hurt Chuchu?

658
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:47,890
Is that not true?

659
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,800
What benefit do I get from hurting her?

660
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,350
How would I know?

661
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,940
It's not your first time targeting her.

662
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,080
- I—
- You dare say that you haven't?

663
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,290
Yes! I am targeting her.

664
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,820
But when did I ever hurt her?

665
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,320
When have you actually seen me hurt her?

666
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,040
Then why did you go?

667
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,170
To ruin the turning point of your relationship with Chuchu, okay?

668
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,450
Why do you want to ruin my relationship with Chuchu?

669
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:15,250
Because I like you, okay? I like you!

670
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,260
♫ The silhouettes of the concrete jungle ♫

671
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:36,090
Oh God! Did I just suddenly confess?

672
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,430
♫ All I see is you ♫

673
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,010
Why?

674
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,340
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

675
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,730
♫ Watching for the next morning ♫

676
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,470
Say it.

677
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,050
What do you like about me?

678
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,970
Money.

679
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,240
You confessed to Situ?

680
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,340
Where did your appetite go?

681
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,020
A car ran over it.

682
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,630
Normal people wouldn't have an appetite at a time like this, right?

683
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,070
Are you a normal person?

684
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,160
No.

685
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,780
A normal person with shame would go hit themselves against a wall right now.

686
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,950
I'm not. I'm still holding on.

687
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,180
The confession that I imagined was not like this!

688
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,150
Then what was it like?

689
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,890
The confession scene

690
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,250
should be romantic.

691
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,320
I love you.
(in Korean)

692
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,500
Perhaps it's sorrowful.

693
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,390
I like you.
(in Korean)

694
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,950
Forget it. That couple divorced anyway.
(Reference to Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo)

695
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,980
Perhaps it's...

696
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,310
overbearing.

697
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,980
Situ Aoran, I want you to become my monarch.

698
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,290
What do you mean?

699
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,070
You just became that reason...

700
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:12,620
the reason I got trapped in this world.

701
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,670
You've thought of every possible version,

702
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,800
but the one you actually performed is...

703
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,030
The disaster version.

704
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:50,050
- Why did you suddenly blurt out your confession?
- I...

705
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,580
I got mad.

706
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:57,270
Because he misunderstood that you were trying to hurt Chuchu?

707
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:02,670
Also, I wanted to go all out to see if there would be an opportunity to change anything.

708
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:07,190
At the very least, changing that pain-in-the-ass of an overbearing CEO

709
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:12,620
ever so slightly... would be fine.

710
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,740
Then, do you think Aoran wavered because of you?

711
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,910
Probably not.

712
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:25,280
An overbearing CEO's intrinsic quality is rock solid indeed.

713
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,200
If I go out to eat right now, am I giving her too much face?
(Showing her too much respect)

714
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,220
But if I don't eat because of her,

715
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,920
that's also giving her too much face, right?

716
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,780
Zheng Xiao'en.

717
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,380
Zheng Xiao'en.

718
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,610
What's up with this person?

719
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,720
Did she run rampant after her confession?

720
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,370
She won't cook anymore after her confession?

721
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,760
She even said she likes me.

722
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,480
She likes me, yet she wants to starve me to death.

723
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,730
Wow! What is this? It looks so tasty!

724
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,920
It smells so good!

725
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,650
You didn't give me a warning before jumping.

726
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:49,690
Even if I didn't die from the fall, I could've died from shock.

727
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:52,540
You're the CEO! You can do anything! You're great at everything!

728
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,650
But I'm not! I'm nothing!

729
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:59,410
I could actually die! Do you know that?

730
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,960
What do you like about me?

731
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,990
Money.

732
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,320
I understand now.

733
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,790
This girl is a psycho.

734
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,790
She's just trying to mess around.

735
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,020
I actually fell for it.

736
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,940
She even knows to come back.

737
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,350
Just watch how I'm going to take care of you.

738
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:57,800
♫ Lost to you ♫

739
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,000
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

740
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,330
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

741
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:11,430
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

742
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:17,930
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

743
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,990
I understand now.

744
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:23,480
This girl is a psycho.

745
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,320
She's just trying to mess around.

746
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,210
I actually fell for it.

747
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,510
She even knows to come back.

748
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:44,470
Just watch how I'm going to take care of you.

749
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:14,360
It's ready. CEO, please eat.

750
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,720
Let's eat together.

751
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,280
It's your business card holder.

752
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,710
You left it on your emergency room bed, and I picked it up.

753
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:27,900
I forgot to return it to you after going back to the hotel.

754
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,900
It's not that important of a matter.

755
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,850
You could've just brought it to the office tomorrow.

756
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:35,700
Your leg is injured, yet you went out of your way to stop by.

757
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,030
I noticed it when I was unpacking my luggage, and I rushed to return it to you.

758
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:42,480
I forgot that we would see each other tomorrow.

759
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,290
Silly.

760
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:53,130
CEO, please eat. I hope it suits your tastes.

761
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,730
It's yummy.

762
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:13,980
I didn't expect that you would also be so skilled, compared to that...

763
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,230
That?

764
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:22,090
Nothing, I happened to eat at a pretty good restaurant a few days ago.

765
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,980
I suddenly thought of it. It's nothing.

766
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,210
Eat.

767
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,200
Have you been doing well at the company?

768
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,470
I'm starting to get the hang of it.

769
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,280
Are you getting along well with your colleagues?

770
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:42,170
It's going well. My colleagues are very willing to guide me.

771
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:44,170
That's good.

772
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,680
Can we not go back?

773
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:08,540
Hey, I'm kidding.

774
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,410
Even if the overbearing CEO is unwavering, I'm still on his payroll.

775
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:20,490
I should still prepare a small dinner.

776
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:23,410
Why are you laughing?

777
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,370
I'm just realizing now that for some people,

778
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:27,410
you can't just listen to what they say.

779
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,770
You have to look at what they do.

780
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,040
What do you mean?

781
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,400
I'm saying that your words are harsh, but your body language is honest.

782
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,210
You're constantly criticizing Aoran with your words,

783
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:38,960
but when it's time, you still go home to prepare dinner.

784
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:49,030
- Zheng Xiao'en.
- What?

785
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:52,120
Has anyone ever told you that you're very special?

786
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:55,650
I don't think so.

787
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,940
No matter which world it is, you're the first.

788
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,940
I've discovered that every day, you come with different surprises.

789
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:12,310
Are you confessing amidst the chaos?

790
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,990
Hurry! Hurry up and tell me you're confessing amidst the chaos!

791
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:19,070
This young girl's confidence needs to be mended by another hot guy.

792
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,700
Cut the crap.

793
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,950
You don't need me to mend it for you right now.

794
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:27,550
I need it, I need it, I need it, I really need it.

795
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,440
God, please give me a glass of overbearing CEO with no ice and 100% sugar.

796
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,920
Right now, I need lots and lots and lots of sweetness.

797
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,720
Just leave it.

798
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,380
It's fine. I will wash the dishes.

799
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,520
You need to...

800
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,080
What?

801
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,040
It's nothing.

802
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,790
You need to change the gloves.

803
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:27,320
Those are Zheng Xiao'en's.

804
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,200
That...

805
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,720
- Thank you.
- This is nothing.

806
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,160
That towel hasn't been boiled.

807
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,930
The ones Xiao'en boiled are hanging outside to dry.

808
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,070
Someone else lives at your house?

809
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,140
I'm home.

810
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:14,990
Do you... like the CEO?

811
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:17,780
I do. I like the CEO.

812
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:22,390
You don't have to accept her feelings, but don't question her sincerity.

813
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,560
If you don't want to see me, I'll just leave.

814
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,560
When did I say that I don't want to see you anymore?

815
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,490
You want to straddle two boats?

816
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,450
A boat like you doesn't even catch my eye.

817
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,570
The CEO's heart is already taken.

818
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,110
Even if I stay here, I won't attain the CEO's love.

819
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:37,230
You've misunderstood Zheng Xiao'en from the beginning.

820
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:40,270
You just haven't realized it yet.

821
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,070
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

822
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:54,110
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

823
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:59,670
♫ A quiet strike ♫

824
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:02,790
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

825
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,110
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

826
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:08,200
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

827
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,660
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

828
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:17,250
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

829
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,520
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

830
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,430
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

831
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:30,150
♫ If I could see you again ♫

832
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:36,840
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

833
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,930
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

834
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:50,260
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

835
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,940
♫ If you were a painter ♫

836
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,910
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

837
01:10:55,910 --> 01:11:00,210
♫ No regrets ♫

838
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:06,410
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
