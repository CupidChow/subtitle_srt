Otherwise, you'll disappear.

This disappearance you speak of... Where is it disappearing to?

Turning into nothingness in the universe,

or turning invisible and going to the ends of the world?

It's so great that I was able to meet you guys here.

Without you guys, I would definitely be very lonely here.

Back when we were all fawning over the CEO together,

I never thought that one of us would really marry him one day.

That’s right. So now you have to recuperate properly first.

Only a ghost will come.

The hospital he was at before had a fire.

161
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,530
After that, there's been no news of He Tianxing.

162
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,960

After Tianliang Group's former CEO, He Tianxing,

333
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,450
fell from a building and was taken to a hospital, his whereabouts became a mystery.

334
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,890
After three months of being hidden away, we finally have some news today.

335
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,330
Let's take you onsite to the medical team's press conference.

336
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,940
After multiple rescue efforts on our part, Mr. He has finally awakened and regained consciousness.

337
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,050
Then, when did He Tianxing get transferred to the sanatorium?

338
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,270
- When will you know the outcome?
- When will he be discharged?

339
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,000
- Could you tell us?
- Can you provide a clearer explanation?

340
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,430
- What will the outcome be?
- When can he be discharged?

341
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,100
A big thanks to the medical team for their rescue efforts.

342
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,950
Mr. He was able to regain consciousness not only due to Dr. Sun's help.

343
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,210
We believe his strong will to live also played a critical role.

344
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,470
He's awake. He's at Green Mountain Psychiatric Sanatorium.

346

- I need to go see him.

Who knew this trick would work?

353

Sure enough, the most dangerous place is the safest place.

354
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,350
That's right. What the CEO said was right.

355
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,360
Instead of hiding, it's better to just expose everything.

356
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,430
This way, reporters will keep their eyes on the CEO 24 hours a day.

357
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,330
So if He Tianjian wants to do something to him, it would be difficult.

00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,000
On the day of the board meeting, we did in fact find a drone.

485
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,330
Where is the drone?

486
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,430
It's been taken care of.

487
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,570
Right now, where is the person who violated privacy laws?

488
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:57,000
The case is still being investigated, so we let her go home for now.

489
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,840
If she really saw the truth of me falling off the building,

490
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,370
her safety will be compromised.

[CEO, You're So Naughty]

492

I told you that the counterattack of the female antagonist wasn't a worthwhile plot.

493
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,930
Who wants to read that?

494
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,800
Just great. The negative reviews are everywhere now.

495
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,540
Why are you so stubborn?

496
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,330
Why didn't you listen?

497
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,330
I did listen, and I asked the author to change it,

498
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,030
but I don't know how it got worse after it was fixed.

499
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,880
When it was published, it was still like this.

500
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,830
I don't want to hear this.

501
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,280
They're all excuses, justifications!

502
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,400
No excuse!

503
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,280
I'm sorry. I also don't know why this happened.

504
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,330
Sorry? Is sorry any use?

505
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,940
Apologies are all fake!

506
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,360
Only money is real.

507

What is wrong with this year?

508
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,270
Not a single good thing happened.

There is! There is a good thing. Xiao'en finally woke up.

510
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,680
She was already discharged from the hospital.

00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,360
Really?

512

What is wrong with my jaw?

513
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,540
If she was discharged, she was discharged. What's so great about that?

514
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,150
Tell her she better quickly come back to work since she's awake.

515
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,460
Xiao'en just woke up.

516
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,340
Can't you let her rest two more days?

517
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,970
Of course she can.

518
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,270
She can rest until Ghost Festival next year and go back with her friends.

519

I understand. I'll tell her to quickly come back to work.

What kind of stupid publishing company are you?

You actually changed the manuscript without my permission!

Ms. Zheng, you don't need to worry.

I've already discussed it with my lawyer.

As long as the person who was spied on,

624
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,770
which is me, doesn't want to investigate it,

625
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:04,550
then it won't be enough to charge you with invasion of privacy.

626
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:11,470
You called me Ms. Zheng?

627

Isn't your last name Zheng?

Other than these three words, is there nothing else you want to say to me?

00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,460
I've already said it.

630
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,300
You won't be sued for violating privacy laws.

631

That's it? There's nothing else?

Is there anything else that I should say that I haven't already said?

633
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,540
There are still a lot of words we haven't exchanged

00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:46,430
Before, I was really worried about you.

648
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,940
Now that I see you've recovered,

649
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,190
I...

650
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,500
I can finally be at peace.

651
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,670
Thank you.

652
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,400
For now, I'm being protected really well.

653
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,030
You, on the other hand, have to be careful.

654
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,980
Tianjian won't simply let you go.

655
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,470
Your hand is still as warm as before.

656
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,990
Remember what you promised me.

657
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,280
As long as I reach out my hand,

658
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,680
I will be able to touch you.

659
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,530
This is the farthest distance you can be away from me.

660
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,020
You're too good to me.

661
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:44,220
Compared to my fantasies from the books I’ve read before,

662
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,350
you’re even better.

663
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,040
It's like you helped me fulfill

664
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,830
all the wishes I had in life.

665
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,310
I have a wish.

666
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,940
Can you help me fulfill it?

667
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,270
What is it?

668
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,790
Can you...

669
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:12,120
not forget me?

670
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,730
For your safety, I think that

671
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:28,440
you'll have to hide out in the place Shanna has arranged for you to stay,

672
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,430
at least until the police search ends.

673
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,930
In the future, we will have our own family.

674
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:43,070
In the future, we will celebrate every important occasion together.

675
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:48,230
We're not allowed to miss each other's special occasions.

676
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,740
Miss Zheng.

677
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,940
What's wrong?

678
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,090
Are you okay?

679
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,970
You must have been scared out of your wits today.

680
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,290
Rest early.

681
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,840
If there's anything you need, let me know.

682
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,270
What are you planning to do?

683
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,180
What do you mean?

684
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,440
For her safety, you arranged a place for her to stay.

685
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,350
I'm concerned she'll take advantage of your kind intentions.

686
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:07,930
You're overthinking things.

687
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,030
That's not it. If what she told the police was true,

688
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,190
that means she's been spying on you for a long time.

689
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:16,750
Just thinking about this kind of behavior really sends chills down your spine.

690
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:20,170
That's enough. Let's not talk about this anymore.

691
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:24,440
- But you don't know that some girls really are—
- That's enough.

692
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,360
I know what you're trying to say,

693
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,960
but you need to watch yourself.

694
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,300
Me?

695
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,330
We still need Miss Zheng's assistance.

696
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:39,190
Don't forget your manners, okay?

697
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,120
That...

698
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,420
I'm sorry. You guys can go ahead.

699
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:53,590
That's all. You've worked hard today. Rest early.

700
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,270
I understand.

701
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,760
You can't fall asleep?

702
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,010
Yes.

703
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:38,030
Did your doctor say how long you would need to be in rehabilitation?

704
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,970
There isn't a doctor who is willing to make a guarantee.

705
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,160
I'm guessing that the more diligent I am, the faster I'll get better.

706
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,230
The lazier I am, the slower it will be.

707
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,850
But you will get better, right?

708
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,880
I should, yes.

709
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,770
That's great.

710
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:11,230
I have a question I want to ask you.

711
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:16,360
It might be a little weird and perhaps invade your privacy,

712
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,980
but I hope that you can give me an honest response.

713
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,430
Go ahead.

714
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:40,560
Are you... afraid of the dark?

715
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:06,960
I... am not afraid of the dark.

716
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,630
What's wrong?

717
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,440
It's nothing.

718
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,760
I'm sorry, I was mistaken. Good night.

719
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,670
As it turns out,

720
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,150
you really aren't Situ Aoran.

721

♫ Silently frozen like a statue ♫

722

723
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:17,860
♫ Is the overdue promise to be discarded? ♫

724
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:25,550
♫ Like a sugar-coated lie ♫

725

♫ Let me accompany you in insomnia ♫

♫ Sleepwalking the whole world together ♫

♫ Got nothing but time ♫

731
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:04,030
My overbearing CEO has disappeared.

732
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:06,170
I will never be able to find him again.

733

♫ There will be no more parting ♫

736
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,110
Zheng Xiao'en, where did you run off to?

737
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,680
Why are you here?

738
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,290
Didn't you say you would pick me up?

739
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:33,920
You made me wait so long for you.

740
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,590
My calls weren't getting through either.

741
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:40,690
I lost my phone. Sorry.

742
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,630
How did you lose it?

743
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,160
I don't want to talk about it.

744
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,630
Today was full of ups and downs.

745
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,020
Full of ups and downs?

746
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:05,420
What are you doing?

747
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,940
I'm sleeping over at your house.

748
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,610
I'm fine.

749
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,930
I'm not fine.

750
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,120
Situ Aoran messed with me.

751
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,060
You dreamt about Situ Aoran too?

752
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,540
I crashed into Situ Aoran!

753
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,920
Do you know what happened between me and Author Meng today?

754
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:33,690
And that's why Author Meng gave me a harsh scolding.

755
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:35,610
Wouldn't you say I was treated unfairly?

756
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:37,390
Why would I edit the contents for no reason?

757
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,180
And to purposely change it to Zheng Xiao'en at that.

758
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,180
If I were to change it, wouldn't it be to Lin Chuntian?

759
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,510
What's wrong?

760
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:55,980
The Zheng Xiao'en in the book... is me.

761
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:03,890
That's not right. I must have seen Qingfeng somewhere before.

762
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,070
I need to find him.

763
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:08,710
Go buy all of the books that Zheng Xiao'en has handled.

764
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,410
I would like to understand Zheng Xiao'en better.

765
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:17,080
This book shows me that my relationship really existed in a parallel universe.

766
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,390
Situ Aoran from CEO, You're So Naughty is He Tianxing in real life?

767
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,540
Zheng Xiao'en is the person I'm interested in right now.

768
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,560
Even if I look like I'm nothing special,

769
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,090
as long as I do my best, I can also have the opportunity to encounter a miracle.
