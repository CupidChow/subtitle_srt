You're not working during business hours and instead making a big fuss over here!

Sit. Work!

You said you don't know who He Tianxing is? Then who is he?

What is wrong with you?

169

How long have you been working in this company for? Yet you don't know who Situ Aoran is?

170

Situ Aoran...

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,340
Is it that Situ Aoran?

177
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,610
It can't be.

laying bare his perfect physique.

181
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,240
He strides forward with a graceful gait like a cheetah's.

182
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,720
Faintly giving off a dangerous odor of

being able to catch his prey at any time.

184

His eyes seem like bottomless pools

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,400
that exude an unfathomable black gleam.

186

Sharp corners of his mouth outline a cold curve.

187
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,860
A mocking smile makes him seem even more indifferent and arrogant.

188
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,010
A devious charm.

189

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,340
Why does she need to be hospitalized?

194
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,310
The patient isn't waking up, so we need to do further examinations.

195
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,300
Are you the patient's family?

196
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,990
She has no family.

197
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,560
I'm her friend... her best friend!

198

Then please go to the counter and fill out the hospital admittance paperwork for her.

Xiao'en will be okay.

200
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,810
Right. She'll definitely be okay.

201
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,780
The patient's current condition is better than we expected.

202
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,840
Maybe it's because he is young and strong, and he has a firm will to live.

203
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,330
He's already past the critical state.

204
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,850
This was faster than we anticipated.

205

If he continues his treatment, I believe he'll be able to wake up soon.

What happened? Why did the patient's ventilator disconnect?

Sorry, sorry. When I came in just now,

212

I accidentally tripped and pulled on it. Sorry.

213

He's on the brink of death. This isn't something to joke about.

214

Sorry.

Yes, yes, I will. I'm sorry.

Chairwoman He, let me introduce you to this place.

218
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,900
This place is called a hospital.

219
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,550
Miss Chairwoman, shouldn't you think carefully before you act?

220
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,660
The person who should be thinking carefully is you.

221
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,570
Did you forget how his mother died?

222
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,160
I'll never forget the look He Tianxing had in his eyes at that moment.

223
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,070
If he doesn't die now,

224
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,710
then one day, he'll turn around and kill our whole family.

225
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,700
You can't forget it. I can't forget about it either.

226
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,430
But who cares?

227
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,600
The only thing people outside care about right now is why you, He Ming Li,

228
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,660
insisted on switching to a different hospitals when Tianxing was still in critical condition.

229
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,570
Okay, now he's switched hospitals.

230
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,950
But if he dies right after switching hospitals, then what does that mean?

231
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,030
It means that you, He Mingli, are saying,

232
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,910
"Hello! I, He Mingli, killed He Tianxing myself."

233
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,300
So? What about it?

234
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Then let me remind you of a couple more things.

235
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,720
Tianxing worked his way up from the bottom of the company.

236
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,940
He spent all these years working his way up from the bottom to his current position.

237
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,930
There must be many people who support him.

238
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,790
If you choose to go at it with him now,

239
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,290
do you think those people will support you?

240
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,460
Don't know.

241
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,840
But I do know one thing.

242
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,760
If it weren't for Uncle Hu's renegade vote in the last minute,

243
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,150
Tianxing would've been Tianliang's chairman.

244
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,270
Right, there's also the police.

245
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,650
It's not that the police aren't suspicious of Tianxing's accident;

246
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,090
they just haven't found evidence yet.

247
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,060
I know what you're thinking.

248
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,740
It's just that Tianxing really can't die right now.

249
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,690
If he dies now, none of us get away unscathed.

250
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:41,550
Then what if we had the best medical team do their best to save him,

251
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,270
but He Tianxing's injuries were too severe,

252
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:51,110
so he still died two weeks later?

253
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,090
How's that script?

254
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,070
Reasonable, right?

255
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,290
Qiaozhi, send out the news

that He Tianxing's injuries are very severe.

257
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,330
Even though the doctors are doing everything they can to save him,

258
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,960
things aren't looking too good.

259
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,780
Tianliang Group stated that He Tianxing's condition is not looking good,

260
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,600
but the new chairwoman, He Mingli, will absolutely not give up

261
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,990
and will try everything to save him.

262
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,990
Nothing changed after I slept.

263
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,920
Am I crazy, dead, or really inside the novel?

Regardless of what it is,

265
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,810
what do I have to do to get out of here and go back to my world?

Next week's magazine is about to be published!

If you don't do this in three days, then you can go home and not come back.

278

There are still ten days before my next paycheck.

279

I only have NT$800 (~US$26) for these ten days.

280

Because the balance is less than NT$1000, this ATM wouldn't let me withdraw!

would you get the chance to be this close to He Tianxing?

285
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,190
Maybe God pities you,

286
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,770
so he's giving you an opportunity to fulfill your dreams before you die.

Do you not want to take advantage of this opportunity?

That's right! She really needs a spanking.

That's too dreamy! As expected, it deserves to be called a romance novel.

we made plans to meet this weekend.

But she's already been asleep for so many days.

00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,370
Why do you need to go clean the bathroom?

481
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:15,180
Because... because...

482
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,850
Because I have mysophobia.

483
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,630
Even though the custodians do a very thorough job of cleaning,

484
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,250
if I see even the tiniest speck of dust or even one strand of hair in the bathroom,

485
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,340
my entire body will start to itch.

486
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,990
If I don't immediately clean it,

487
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,410
then I'll be thinking about that speck of dust for the entire day,

488
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:34,780
and I won't even be able to focus on work.

489
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:39,030
So I need to immediately clean it right away, right now.

Yes, yes. She has OCD. We all can't stand it.

But thinking about it, loving cleanliness isn't a bad thing.

493
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,010
As long as it doesn't affect work, I let her do whatever she needs to do.

494
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:57,870
So you will notice a speck of dust and even a strand of hair on the floor

495
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,160
that an average person wouldn't notice,

496
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,200
but you didn't notice that someone was in the bathroom stall?

It's confusing, right?

After all, not everyone is intelligent, wise, insightful, and heroic like you, CEO.

it must be hard for you to understand.

It's not that hard to understand.

You don't think I want to get along with her?

The problem is that she doesn't want to!

That's right! Every time we invite her out to dinner or to watch a movie, she always says no.

She never does anything with us. She clearly looks down on us!

She always messes up her work, and I always have to clean up after her!

her role in CEO, You're so Naughty is the female lead.

If Susan, Qiutian, and I all bully her together,

00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,090
Uncle Hu.
[Chief Strategy Officer, He Mingli]

635
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,060
Then it's settled.

636
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,870
I'll be there in person this afternoon.

637
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,080
Yes.

638
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,670
Has the will been found?

639
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:06,920
No news so far.

640
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,430
I have already increased the number of people looking for it.

641
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,310
Finding something is such a simple task. You can't even do that?

642
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,380
I'm sorry.

643
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,000
It wasn't on He Tianxing.

644
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,320
Where can it be?

645
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,880
I will try my best to find it.

646
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,950
You better do it quickly. Otherwise, I can't be at ease.

647
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,950
Okay, understood.

648
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,500
It's almost time for the press conference.

649
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,390
Tell someone to bring the car up front.

650
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,040
Yes.

651
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,410
I must go take a look. What happened that day on the rooftop?

652
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,870
Why did Tianxing suddenly fall down?

653
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:48,950
If there were any clues, the police would have found them already.

654
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:54,440
Sister Shanna, before security gets up there, you'll have a minute and a half.

655
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,830
Hey, the camera on the rooftop seems crooked.

656
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,210
Did it get blown by the wind?

657
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,300
I'll go up and look.

658
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,180
[Crime Scene Prohibited Entry]

659
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,460
Hello, what's going on?

660
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,140
Sister Shanna, why are you here?

661
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,650
Ah, I was just passing by and saw that the door to the rooftop was open.

662
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,150
I thought I should come and take a look.

663
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:02,270
I'm sorry, the chairwoman already gave an order that no one is allowed to come up.

664
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,700
How's the situation?

665
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,480
Take a look yourself.

666
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,870
Tianliang Construction and Tianliang Hospitality have reached a strategic partnership.

667
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:24,490
Both parties are taking this contractual opportunity to establish a comprehensive, multilevel collaborative relationship.

668
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:28,030
So when the news broke, Tianliang Hospitality's stock prices skyrocketed.

669
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,260
It is highly anticipated to emerge as a leading brand in the industry.

670
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,550
Tianliang Group's operational performance for the next few years is expected to...

671
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,500
Today's biggest headline:

672
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,600
Tianliang Construction acquired 19% of Tianliang Hospitality's shares.

673
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,010
It's equivalent to putting the brain-dead Tianliang Hospitality on an ECMO (life-support machine).

674
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,560
Even if that's the case, there's no way Tianliang Hospitality can come back to life.

675
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,080
It's just a shame that Tianxing

676
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,580
put in so much time and effort into revamping Tianliang Construction.

677
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,210
Now because of He Mingli,

678
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,860
it'll be back at square one.

679
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,250
This is for you.

680
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,000
I didn't bake it myself, but it's really good.

681
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,750
Try it.

682
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:13,680
For me?

683
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,880
Yes. I'm really sorry about yesterday.

684
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,770
Even though it was a misunderstanding,

685
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:22,930
I feel really bad for putting you in a difficult situation.

686
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,300
Can you forgive me?

687
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,380
Since it was a misunderstanding, there's no need to forgive or not forgive.

688
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,820
It's fine now that we've talked it through.

689
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:39,240
Sure enough, kindheartedness is the standard for the female lead of a romance novel.

690
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,950
Then, remember to forgive me when I steal your man later.

691
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:47,460
Here, give it a try.

692
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,830
It's delicious!

693
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,900
All that matters is that you like it. Have some more.

694
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:00,890
Do you want to drink coffee? I'll make it for you.

695
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,090
There's no need. Stay here. I'll make it myself.

696
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:08,000
- How is that acceptable?
- Don't worry about it.

697
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:11,990
Zheng Xiao'en, come here.

698
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:18,360
What are you doing? Why are you talking and laughing with her?

699
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,490
Think about it.

700
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,620
Yesterday, the CEO caught us bullying her.

701
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,540
If he sees us giving her the cold shoulder today,

702
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,500
what do you think will happen?

703
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,060
That's right!

704
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,150
Attention, attention!

705
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,590
Our company has been preparing for this major event for three months now.

706
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:43,420
Royal Venture Capital's appreciation banquet for investors is the day after tomorrow.

707
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:47,300
Our department will be entering the venue early to handle the decorations today.

708
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,710
The CEO takes this appreciation banquet very seriously.

709
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:58,040
Every single one of you has to pick up the energy.

710
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,830
I absolutely do not want to see anyone screw up.

711
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:05,810
If I get scolded by the higher-ups because of you, I will give you a far worse scolding.

712
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,010
- Understood?
- Understood!

713
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:12,010
Okay, get on with what you're supposed to. Get cracking!

714
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,890
You see, you see? The incident has arrived as expected.

715
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:32,260
Chuchu will definitely run into trouble at this investors' banquet.

716
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,550
My opportunity has come.

717
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,350
♫ Lost to you ♫

718
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:49,670
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

719
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,910
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

720
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:59,100
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

721
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:05,660
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

722
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,470
Chop-chop.

723
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,240
Be careful with the glasses.

724
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,340
Arrange the tableware nicely.

725
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,690
To have a scenario where the hero saves the damsel-in-distress,

726
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,470
a crisis needs to be manufactured.

727
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,200
But first, I need to confirm

728
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,210
whether Situ Aoran will definitely appear whenever Chuchu is in danger.

729
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:40,060
Otherwise, it will be no use.

730
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,920
What are you doing?

731
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,180
It's not surprising at all.

732
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,920
Are you okay?

733
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,540
I'm okay.

734
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,930
I'm sorry, I was trying to grab your clothes.

735
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,890
I wanted to ask if you could help me set the tablecloth.

736
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:05,060
My hand slipped, sorry.

737
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,180
It's alright.

738
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:22,760
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

739
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:44,250
Now that the male lead's actions are confirmed, next up are the incidents.

740
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:49,630
Everything here is very suspicious.

741
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,320
The tablecloth has a hazard index of 30%.

742
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,420
Chuchu might get hooked onto it and fall.

743
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,480
Knives and forks are 40%.

744
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,960
If Chuchu touches these, there is a high probability that she'll get cut and see blood.

745
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,340
The extension cord is 50%.

746
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,140
Chuchu will definitely trip.

747
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,790
The chandelier is 60%.

748
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:37,110
At the critical moment, it will fall onto Chuchu and injure her.

749
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,340
The flower baskets are 75%.

750
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:51,460
If Chuchu walks by, it will likely fall over and weigh down on her.

751
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,870
The champagne tower is 85%.

752
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:03,570
If Chuchu lightly touches this, that would be terrible.

753
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,280
This big door is 99%.

754
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:13,480
No matter what romance novel it is, the female lead always has beef with doors.

755
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,150
They always run into doors as if they're blind.

756
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:20,000
This is the ultimate lethal weapon.

757
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,730
Put this here. Go over there.

758
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:31,990
Hurry up.

759
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,260
This place is too dangerous.

760
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,100
What's dangerous?

761
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,720
Hi.

762
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,600
Hi.

763
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,110
You don't remember me?

764
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,830
I remember.

765
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,910
Then what's my name?

766
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,480
Hello, my name is Duanmu Qingfeng.
(Qingfeng means spring breeze)

767
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,100
What's wrong?

768
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,230
It's nothing.

769
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:17,010
It's just that this author's taste for picking names...

770
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:20,030
It's been hard on you.

771
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,470
You're a really strange person.

772
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:29,920
Is this a compliment?

773
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,710
No.

774
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,710
As a Royal Group staff member,

775
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,640
you actually didn't know Situ or myself.

776
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,110
Isn't that strange enough?

777
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:44,530
You don't understand.

778
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:47,020
I'm asking you because I don't understand.

779
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,500
You just said it's dangerous here. How is it dangerous?

780
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,470
It's...

781
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,290
These knives and forks are too dangerous for you. Let me do it.

782
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,000
Okay.

783
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:08,320
Hey, heights are too dangerous for you. Come down.

784
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,990
Okay.

785
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,750
What?

786
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,180
This is a tactic.

787
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,280
Xiao'en said that we were just caught by the CEO yesterday,

788
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,720
so we have to treat Chuchu better today so we don't blow our cover.

789
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,330
Oh, no wonder. Okay.

790
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,020
Hey, be careful!

791
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,990
Zheng Xiao'en, what are you doing?

792
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:58,360
Blood!

793
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,660
Good morning. How are you today?

794
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,240
Doctor!

795
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:20,240
Don't you think that woman is really weird? She's acting so sneaky.

796
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,400
Having successfully replaced the female lead in her crisis, the male lead should be saving me soon, right?

797
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,800
What do you like about Aoran?

798
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,810
From a very long time ago, he has been like a place of refuge to me.

799
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:32,200
Someone is trapped in the freezer. Stop the vehicle.

800
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,590
I'm afraid she'll get hypothermia.

801
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,640
It's all my fault for being so clumsy.

802
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,140
Why am I so useless?

803
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,200
It's a man's responsibility to protect a woman.

804
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:44,020
It's my destiny to protect you.

805
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:56,810
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

806
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,810
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

807
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:05,360
♫ A quiet strike ♫

808
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,630
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

809
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:10,850
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

810
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:13,920
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

811
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,360
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

812
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,990
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

813
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:26,120
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

814
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:31,150
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

815
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:35,840
♫ If I could see you again ♫

816
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:42,540
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

817
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:46,620
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

818
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:54,650
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

819
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:59,600
♫ If you were a painter ♫

820
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,650
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

821
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:05,930
♫ No regrets ♫

822
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:11,960
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
