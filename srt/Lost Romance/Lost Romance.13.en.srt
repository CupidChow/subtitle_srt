325
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,400
Don’t be too touched.

326
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,130
You're so touched, right?

327
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,380
Take it. These are the flowers I got for you.

328
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,840
Zheng Xiao’en, I specially bought flowers for you. Where are you?

329
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,080
I went home.

330
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Why did you go home?

331
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,130
I hadn't showered or changed my clothes.

332
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,000
If I didn't go home, what else would I do?

333
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,590
You wait there.

334
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,080
What?

335
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:06,590
Could the overbearing CEO be performing "Woman, you can only stay by my side"?

336
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,520
Aiyo, I’m not that charming.

337
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,260
We just haven't seen each other for a day,

Give me the main lead's ring of light!

340
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,970
Why am I wearing one sock with leopard print and another with zebra print?

341
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,520
Oh my god, how can I meet people in this state?

342
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,230
Where’s that foot mask that Qiutian gave me last time

343
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,520
that made my foot super smooth after I used it?

344
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,260
I don’t know if I have any left.

The magical weapon of a date, up you go!

348
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,850
I have to take good care of myself from head to toe.

349
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,700
Then my skin will be fair, soft, and smooth.

350
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,850
Not good.

Take it.

363
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,950
It's just a typical modest suite.

364
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,380
So people can actually live in such small places.

365
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,130
This author must have seen Meteor Garden before.

366

She's even paying tribute to Dao Mingsi's lines.

367
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,570
I'm saying, it's been cleaned really well.

368
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,400
You typically look disorganized,

369
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,010
but once you do things, you're pretty meticulous.

370

Don't worry.

371
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,290
You treat this as a trash can?

372
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,930
Have you ever heard of a physics law?

373
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,200
Water flows towards lower elevations.

374
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,710
It's just like a trashcan that is lower than the couch.

375
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,880
It slowly falls into the trashcan.

376
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,290
This is a law of nature.

377
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,340
Do you have tea here?

Wait, don't!

00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,020
You might have heard of a Buddhist saying.

That is everything depends on fate.

382
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,470
I have always been waiting for a certain feeling.

383

Once the feeling comes, then I can put them away.

I don't know why you came.

Prince Chiaki.

396

You're just an overbearing CEO.

397
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,840
You're even pickier than a prince.

398
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,400
Then go with the prince.

399

00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,710
If you don't like that the bathroom is far away, I can carry you there.

491
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,910
You just have to give me a kiss.

492
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,520
Go away.

493
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:18,130
Are you free after work tomorrow?

494
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,160
What? If you treat me to lobster, I'll go.

495
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,780
It can be as expensive as you want it to be.

496
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,940
You can't eat till you bankrupt me.

497
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,450
Okay. I'm not afraid.

498
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,180
Give me a kiss and there'll be one more ounce of lobster.

499
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,690
What's there to be afraid of?

500
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,940
You better prepare 100 ounces of lobster.

501
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,210
- Hey, I said to kiss—
- You didn't specify a location.

502
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:48,100
1 ounce, 2 ounces, 3 ounces, 4 ounces, 5 ounces, 6 ounces.

503
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,630
7, 8, 9, 10.

504
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,530
100 ounces of lobster!

[Information Desk - Maintain public order, protect social safety, prevent all harm, and promote welfare of the people.]

507
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,020
Thank... thank you.

508
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,770
About the company...

509
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,750
Situ hopes that you resign on your own.

510
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,120
That way it's more dignified for you.

511
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,740
I can understand your feelings,

512
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,190
but the last step you took was really wrong.

513
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,240
I just wanted to fight for it. Is that also wrong?

514
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,620
Zheng Xiao'en can fight for it.

515
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,010
Why can't I?

516
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,800
Xiao'en at least had a bottom line.

517
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,310
She never hurt you.

518
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,970
Let's go. I'll take you home.

519
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,740
I know you like Zheng Xiao'en.

520
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:55,820
I don't have a chance with the CEO, but you still have a chance.

521
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,840
When it comes to knowing each other, you have known Zheng Xiao'en longer.

522
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,830
You treat Xiao'en better than the CEO treats Xiao'en.

523
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,930
Why can't you?

524
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,450
Don't you want to know what place you have in Zheng Xiao'en's heart?

525
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,170
If you don't ask and just lose her, will you be satisfied?

526
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,000
That's enough!

527
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,150
Today, it's probably not going to be convenient.

528
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,350
I'll call you a taxi.

529

I know you like Zheng Xiao'en.

You're my Supreme Master Qingfeng.

Who's Supreme Master Qingfeng?

533
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,470
Don't worry about it.

534
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,590
All you need to know is that

535
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,890
it holds the most brilliant spot in my heart, just like popcorn chicken does.

536
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,420
Thank you. You're always by my side when I need it most.

537
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,000
It's because you're a person who treats others with sincerity.

538
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,860
You make me feel like this world is especially full of warmth.

539

May we both be able to be with the ones we like.

May we both find the happiness that we want.

541
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,300
Well said!

542
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,400
Didn't you say I'm destined to silently give them my blessings?

543
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,660
Destiny is destiny, but we can still fight for what we want.

Aoran.

546
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,280
Did you have another nightmare?

547
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,410
It's fine. Go back to sleep.

548
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:31,300
Can I tell you a little bit about He Tianxing?

549
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,340
This person really exists, but don't ask me who he is,

550
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,910
and don't ask me where you can find him. Okay?

551
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,480
Why?

552
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,020
It's because I can't even explain it myself.

553
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:15,330
Actually, He Tianxing's current state

554
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:19,430
is exactly as it appears in your dreams.

555
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,450
He Tianxing is the CEO of Tianliang Group.

556
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:29,570
He has an older sister and an older brother.

557
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:33,510
They own an enormous family corporation.

558
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,940
I only know of He Tianxing

559
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,810
from seeing him in gossip magazines and business newsletters.

560
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,920
I would simply never cross paths with him.

561
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,200
It's just that...

562
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,510
A lot of your dreams are things that actually happened to him.

563
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,840
He is as young as you.

564
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,330
His life was about to take off, and then he ended up like this.

565
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,410
Perhaps he simply doesn't want to wake up.

566
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,700
♫ Lost to you ♫

567
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:25,210
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

568
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,510
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

569
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:34,680
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

570
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:41,340
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

571
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,670
He is as young as you.

572
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:52,170
His life was about to take off, and then he ended up like this.

573
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,810
Perhaps he simply doesn't want to wake up.

574
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,980
How could that be?

575
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,710
You said he's an illegitimate child.

576
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,320
Although his family would have provided him with a lot of resources,

577
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,550
his brother and sister certainly would have been better off.

578
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,640
The mother wouldn't give him much support.

579
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,940
His father values him only because he's capable.

580
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,000
Whether his relatives would accept him is another problem.

581
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:31,850
Only by staying at the top does his life have value.

582
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,960
Isn't this tragic?

583
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,630
Perhaps being in a coma

584
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:45,010
is the only way he can truly be himself again.

585
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,690
Is that really the case?

586
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,780
Then what about you?

587
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,750
Me?

588
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,490
Yes.

589
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:09,510
Do you think you're happy right now?

590
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,290
I think I'm the happiest right now.

591
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:27,340
Maybe it's because I experienced being useless for the first time today

592
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,110
that I now know living like He Tianxing is not okay.

593
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,310
It's too hard.

594
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:38,450
If you spend your life working only toward a goal for others,

595
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:42,380
what's the purpose of your own existence?

596
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,420
Is that really what you think?

597
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,910
Yes. I think I'm the happiest right now.

598
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:01,480
If only time could freeze at this very moment, that would be great.

599
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:08,820
He Tianxing, do you really not want to wake up?

600
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,450
Can I consider Aoran's words to be your true feelings

601
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,210
and stay here like this forever?

602
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,580
You go in first. I need to tie my shoes.

603
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,830
I forgot to drink milk tea for breakfast. I'll go buy it.

604
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,570
I'll have someone bring it to you later.

605
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,660
He's here. Our Royal Group's second scenic sight is here.

606
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,970
Act more reserved.

607
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,110
Hey, where is our first scenic sight?

608
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,150
Did the married couple quarrel?

609
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,820
Not seeing the CEO and CSO come to work together

610
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,970
makes me feel like there's a hole in my heart.

611
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,180
Me too.

612
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,760
Look, look! The CEO and Zheng Xiao'en are coming into work together.

613
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,560
If you keep doing this, I'm going to kiss you.

614
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,260
No way.

615
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,360
Everyone is going to hate me to death.

616
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,540
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead for sure.

617
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,810
Good morning.

618
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,210
Morning.

619
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,890
Morning.

620
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:44,370
Morning.

621
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,440
What's wrong?

622
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,910
What are you guys doing?

623
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,590
Don't worry.

624
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,980
It's okay.

625
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:27,850
Everyone heard about how you rescued the CEO, so now you've gained a lot of shippers (lit. "couple fans").

626
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,250
The girls from the Secretary's Office said you saved the CEO from a sea of fire.

627
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,790
The moment you guys came out, a building exploded!

628
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,230
It was super thrilling.

629
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:41,050
The version I heard was that the CEO almost fell from a high altitude.

630
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,970
You gave it your all to grab hold of the CEO with your two hands.

631
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,960
The mailroom girls said that the CEO's car had been hacked.

632
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,410
It kept driving toward a cliff.

633
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,810
You descended from the skies and stopped the car.

634
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,650
The whole rear end of the car even bumped up.

635
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,180
Xiao'en, you should apply to be a bodyguard.

636
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:00,040
Enough. It didn't exactly happen like that.

637
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:10,030
Oh, right. Chuchu resigned of her own accord.

638
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,850
Actually, it was rather kind of the company to allow her to resign.

639
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,260
I never thought that she would become so extreme.

640
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,080
That's right. I normally didn't like her that much,

641
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,430
but seeing her become like this doesn't feel that good either.

642
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,830
Hey, don't feel any pressure.

643
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,250
That's right. Sometimes that's how dating is.

644
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,290
Nothing was official between her and the CEO.

645
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,370
She can't expect him to like her just because they were flirting ambiguously.

646
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,140
That's not it either.

647
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,670
It's just that I ended up reaping the benefits in the end,

648
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,650
so I don't know what I should say.

649
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,090
Hello?

650
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,990
Yes, yes.

651
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,970
Okay.

652
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,980
What?

653
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,570
[My Man]

654
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,500
Got carried away by his charm.

655
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,990
Hey, Qiutian. I...

656
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,280
Sit.

657
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:21,710
Why did you ask to see us so urgently, CEO?

658
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,550
Personal matter.

659
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:29,510
What is your personal matter that we can help you with, CEO?

660
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,230
Proposal.

661
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,630
♫ Lost to you ♫

662
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:41,230
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

663
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:44,630
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

664
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:50,780
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

665
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:57,320
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

666
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:02,690
Why did you ask to see us so urgently, CEO?

667
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,580
Personal matter.

668
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,340
What is your personal matter that we can help you with, CEO?

669
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,510
Proposal.

670
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,970
Thank you for looking after us, CEO.

671
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,210
My department still has some things to get done. I'll take my leave now.

672
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,960
If the director has matters to tend to, the disciple will carry the toil.

673
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,320
I will take my leave too.

674
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,700
No wonder he didn't ask for Xiao'en.

675
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,750
Sure enough, he's an overbearing CEO. Even his rate of progress is overbearing.

676
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,640
You picked up bad behavior from Xiao'en.

677
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,380
Sit down.

678
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,050
Since that's the case, let's deal with this personal matter officially.

679
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,660
May I ask what expectations you have of this proposal, CEO?

680
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,560
Of course, it has to be one that makes Xiao'en feel touched.

681
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,910
Then, may I ask if you have any initial plans, CEO?

682
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:53,500
Why are you looking for me?

683
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,370
Zheng Xiao'en.

684
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,710
Marry me.

685
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,280
Also...

686
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:11,940
As I hold Xiao'en, we jump down together.

687
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,230
"Zheng Xiao'en, marry me."

688
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,420
CEO, you know that Xiao'en is afraid of heights, right?

689
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,170
Of course.

690
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:26,430
Being in the most extreme of circumstances elicits one's truest feelings.

691
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,270
May I ask if you normally give gifts to girls, CEO?

692
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,820
Of course.

693
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,480
What's your standard for giving a gift then?

694
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,930
Of course, the more expensive it is, the better.

695
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:39,780
What do we do? I think this situation is a bit difficult.

696
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,890
I never thought that beneath the CEO's pheromones to the max

697
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:43,850
lies the heart of a straight man made of iron and steel.

698
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:45,340
All the women came swarming in.

699
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,530
But he doesn't feel moved at all.

700
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:52,150
- It's difficult.
- It's really difficult.

701
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:00,460
CEO, let's start at kindergarten.

702
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,340
Let's start with what Xiao'en likes exactly.

703
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:07,260
Then, we'll take a look at what would make Xiao'en feel touched.

704
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,970
Okay.

705
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,650
Qingfeng!

706
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,110
What's going on with you today?

707
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,080
What do you mean, what's going on?

708
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,500
You seem like you're not in a great mood.

709
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,780
Is it because of Chuchu?

710
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:33,690
Yes.

711
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:36,520
I knew it.

712
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,060
It's okay, comrade.

713
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,800
Chuchu just took things too hard momentarily.

714
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,820
Don't be sad.

715
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,970
It's not good to be depressed all by yourself.

716
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,020
But I'm still really sad. Could you keep me company?

717
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,320
Of course.

718
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,440
Then are you free tonight?

719
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,100
Tonight?

720
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,260
Are you free after work tomorrow?

721
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,330
If you treat me to lobster, I'll go.

722
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,970
It can be as expensive as you want it to be.

723
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,300
You can't eat till you bankrupt me.

724
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:12,150
I have dinner plans with Aoran tonight.

725
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,770
Forget it. It's fine.

726
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,730
Wait.

727
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,510
Eating can happen whenever.

728
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,260
It's fine, it's fine.

729
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,990
After all, we came all this way together sharing our revolutionary sentiments.

730
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,850
It's okay. Trust me.

731
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,430
Then, see you after work.

732
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:33,280
See you after work.

733
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,800
We're both members of Club Broken Heart.

734
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,410
I shouldn't be the only one to find happiness.

735
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:51,480
[Paris Jewelry]

736
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:57,940
Which one is the most expensive?

737
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:05,960
I mean, out of these, which style is most popular with women in their twenties?

738
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,160
Why do we have to reschedule?

739
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,990
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

740
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:25,220
But it seems like Qingfeng's in a really bad mood because of Chuchu.

741
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,270
It's not because of Chuchu.

742
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,970
Then what is it because of?

743
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:43,880
From the first day I came here, Qingfeng took care of me the most.

744
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,640
So, seeing that he's in a bad mood,

745
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:51,650
do you really think I should put dates before mates?

746
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,010
Then, is it reasonable that you're canceling on me the first time I make plans with you?

747
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:02,280
- Why don't I give you a rain check?
- Who wants your rain check?

748
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,700
Then... I'll write a hundred massage vouchers for you.

749
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,150
Is there any need for you to do that?

750
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,560
Then...

751
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,770
I don't care. The lobster has already been airlifted here.

752
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:14,470
The chef already killed it.

753
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,930
I have to see you at the restaurant tonight.

754
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,450
- But—
- There are no buts.

755
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,390
If you want to go comfort Qingfeng, then go,

756
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,160
but you have to come to the restaurant.

757
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,030
I will wait for you no matter how late it is.

758
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:32,220
Can I say that you're really handsome like this?

759
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,960
Get out of here.

760

The noble son is a eucalyptus in the breeze (tall and handsome).

01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,530
His disposition resembles nature itself.

762
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,110
His eyes carry a murderous aura.

763
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,890
Hurry up and get out of here.

764
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,930
Otherwise I'm going to change my mind.

765
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:47,270
Yes! See you tonight.

766
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,550

That way you won't disappear.

01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:10,440
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

810
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,240
♫ If you were a painter ♫

811
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,180
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

812
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:20,470
♫ No regrets ♫

813
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:26,930
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
