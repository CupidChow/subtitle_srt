Zheng Xiao'en, why are you being such a busybody?

Since something like this happened, why didn't you come to me?

Right. So knowing you for so long,

You took Zheng Xiao'en away from me right in front of my face.

It's not only overbearing and unruly but also very rude.

Okay, just take it as me being rude.

Aoran, I am well aware of the things that I should and shouldn't do.

141
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,450
Those whom I can be close with and those whom I should stay away from, I'll deal with it on my own.

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,660
I was dragged away by the overbearing CEO in front of everyone.

161
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,720
Don't only female leads get this kind of treatment?

162
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,050
Author, I really can't guess what you're thinking.

163
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,940
Did you abandon your CEO Lorem Ipsum text generator?

164
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,420
Situ Aoran grabbed me by this hand, right?

165
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,380
Then I won't wash my hand for three days.

166
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,210
Wait.

167
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,070
Zheng Xiao'en, you can't have selective memory loss.

168
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,570
Did you forget what he said to you?

169
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,510
Do you like Qingfeng?

170
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,390
Then why are you ambiguously flirting with him and causing him to misunderstand?

171
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,130
Qingfeng is my best friend.

172
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,580
I won't let anyone toy with him.

173
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,010
I'm toying with Duanmu Qingfeng? Am I that type of person?

174
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,360
If I wanted to toy with someone, I'd toy with you, okay?

175
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,790
Ruining my steak and my innocence.

176
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,920
Don't think that I'll forgive you just because you're handsome!

177
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,480
Let me tell you, I, Zheng Xiao'en, won't just let this go!

178
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,650
Three seconds.

179
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,500
Three seconds is up.

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,300
I'll forgive you. Good night.

181
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,970
Let me go inside to see Tianxing.

182
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,830
I'll leave right after I see him.

183
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,820
The chairwoman said no one can go in without her permission.

184
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,290
At least let me confirm with my own eyes that he's still alive.

185
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,420
Don't make things hard for me.

186
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,920
He Mingli isn't even here. What are you afraid of?

187
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,780
There are surveillance cameras everywhere.

188
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,880
Stop looking for trouble.

189
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Qiaozhi!

190
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,310
It was a dream.

191
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,880
Dreaming of falling off a building means that you'll soon face a huge difficulty in life.

192
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,470
You must actively face it to overcome your dilemma.

193
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,720
What dilemma does my life have?

194
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,000
There is. There really is.

195
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,160
This is bigger than any place I've ever lived in.

196
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,680
It's a dilemma of epic, disastrous proportions.

197
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:34,010
The great demon king in my life is Zheng Xiao'en.

198
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,430
Her brain circuits are different from those of ordinary people.

199
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,090
There is no logic to them at all.

200
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,690
Where did this punk come from?

201
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,190
- For her, you'd actually—
- Stop badmouthing Zheng Xiao'en.

202
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,540
Because I like her.

203
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,650
Was Qingfeng being serious when he said he liked Zheng Xiao'en?

204
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,600
Good morning.

205
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Good morning.

206
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,990
What?

207
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,660
Have you been okay the past few days?

208
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,670
I'm fine. Why?

209
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,080
Good.

210
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,780
Young Master suddenly came and pointed you out, asking about you.

211
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,800
- Young Master?
- Situ Moran.

212
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,980
The CEO's half-brother.

213
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,440
- What's wrong? Do you know him?
- What's wrong? Do you know him?

214
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,540
Hello, CEO.

215
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,600
Good morning.

216
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,950
I'm having trouble breathing.

217
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,210
Don't you think the pheromone levels here are off the charts?

218
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,620
The CEO looks so good in those clothes.

219
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,640
I think he looks even better with nothing on.

220
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,490
How obscene.

221
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,590
Why is your face getting red?

222
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,500
- Are you playing perverse scenes in your head?
- I'm not!

223
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,770
- You are!
- You are!

224
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,110
How obscene!

225
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,380
- Zheng Xiao'en.
- What?

226
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,090
Good morning.

227
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,030
Good morning.

228
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Let's go.

229
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,220
Hey! Why did CEO specifically say good morning to you?

230
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,190
Is he displaying his authority?

231
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,710
Who knows?

232
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,210
Did you step on his sore spot again?

233
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,270
Is something wrong?

234
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,360
What did I do?

235
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,270
You keep smiling.

236
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm in a good mood. Can't I smile?

237
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:13,220
Oh, you're in a good mood because you saw me being respectful to Zheng Xiao'en?

238
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,380
That's right. Keep it up.

239
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,180
Wait, hold on.

240
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,570
If you want to remind me of how to write the word "respect," then don't worry.

241
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,170
I still remember.

242
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,450
Who's talking to you about that?

243
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,310
I wanted to ask why Moran suddenly came back.

244
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,580
He's always like this.

245
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,540
You're not used to it yet?

246
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,560
For money?

247
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,580
What else would it be for?

248
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,060
You have to warn the CEO to be careful of this person.

249
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,310
I still don't know yet. Just take it as my sixth sense.

250
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,210
I feel like this time, something is off.

251
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,230
Don't worry.

252
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,770
Moran's taste does have a wide range,

253
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,440
but Zheng Xiao'en isn't his type.

254
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,500
You don't need to be jealous of him.

255
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,110
I'm not worried about him. I'm worried about you.

256
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,400
All in all, you just be more careful.

257
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,990
What's the reason?

258
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,460
My sixth sense doesn't need any reasoning.

259
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,140
So mysterious.

260
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,960
You're becoming more and more like Zheng Xiao'en.

261
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,400
What do I need to be careful of?

262
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,130
Since you still haven't gotten an internal call,

263
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,000
then you must have safely passed.

264
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,080
Yay!

265
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,390
Safe! Today is another beautiful day!

266
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,300
Our Xiao'en is truly washed white of her sins.

267
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,850
Sister, from now on, you need to conduct yourself properly, okay?

268
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,490
When have I not conducted myself properly? Why would you say that?

269
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,820
No, we're just kindly reminding the rehabilitated offender not to cause trouble again.

270
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,800
If you must do something bad, then remember not to get caught.

271
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,730
Thank you both.

272
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,690
You guys were the ones who pushed me to the dark side.

273
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,090
That's why we worked so hard to wash your sins white.

274
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,150
You also know that on one side we have friendship and on the other we have love.

275
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,630
We're between a rock and a hard place.

276
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,500
It's very difficult to manage.

277
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,990
Wait!

278
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,460
Friendship is me. Then love is?

279
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,880
The CEO.

280
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,410
The nation's dream guy. The ladies' man. The walking pheromones.

281
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,570
Royal Group's public goods. Isn't this love?

282
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,540
- Of course it is.
- It definitely is.

283
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,180
- This is exactly what love is.
- This is exactly what love is.

284
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,190
You scared me to death!

285
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,650
Chuchu, what are you doing?

286
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,130
Sorry, my hand slipped.

287
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,880
Did I scare you?

288
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,650
I'm sorry. I'll go make copies.

289
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,020
Why do I feel like slapping her again? Is this normal?

290
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,970
It's normal. Because I'm starting to clench my fists too.

291
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,650
Alright now.

292
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,010
Didn't we agree that if we can't beat her, we'll just join her?

293
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,530
Okay. Then let's think about how to celebrate Xiao'en's rebirth.

294
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,050
Let's eat pork feet noodles!

295
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,200
- What is that?
- What is that?

296
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,620
Oh, never mind. Let's think of something else.

297
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,440
Then, should we eat budae jjigae? I want to take on the spiciest challenge.

298
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,120
We ate that last time.

299
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,040
You can't even handle mild spice. How can you eat the spiciest level?

300
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,950
- I'm big spice girl.
- I'm the big spice girl.

301
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,950
No, I'm the big spice girl.
("spice girl" can also be translated as "sexy girl")

302
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,010
Hello, CSO.

303
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,720
Which floor?

304
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,130
I'm going to make photocopies.

305
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,970
Thank you.

306
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,570
Oh right, are you free after work tomorrow?

307
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,670
Are you asking me?

308
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,870
I told you I was going to give you a scented wax tablet.

309
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,610
I actually finished making it a long time ago.

310
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,210
It's just that I never found the opportunity to give it to you.

311
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,450
I can't believe that you still remember.

312
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,780
Of course I remember.

313
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,800
Then... is tomorrow okay?

314
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,610
See you tomorrow.

315
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,590
She actually remembered?

316
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,970
I forgot about that a long time ago.

317
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,300
[Tianliang Group]

318
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,220
Old Hu, what do you mean by this?

319
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
Weren't we going to discuss electing a new chair?

320
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,530
Why are He Mingli's people here too?

321
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,820
Director Xu, don't be so worked up.

322
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,630
It's like this.

323
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,310
Our captain at the helm has already veered off course.

324
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,470
I'm sure you know this deep down, right?

325
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,910
I invited every director here today to discuss what everyone wants to do next.

326
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,790
Will you jump ship or change the captain?

327
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,230
Change to whom? You?

328
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,810
Me?

329
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,420
I'm old now. Even if I want to, I don't have the ability to.

330
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,420
We should leave it to the young ones to charge into battle.

331
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,700
Veterans like us should provide assistance at their side.

332
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,850
Hopefully, the Group can get back on track.

333
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,300
Young ones? Who?

334
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,140
Thank you! Thank you!

335
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,280
Thank you, Director Xu. Take care.

336
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,520
Uncle Hu, why do I feel that Director Xu doesn't really support me in taking over?

337
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,340
Don't worry.

338
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,600
Now that Tianxing's gone, he can only choose between you and your sister.

339
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:49,160
But your sister desires to get rid of all the directors and employees who supported Tianxing.

340
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,980
He's left with no other choice. There's only you.

341
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,970
So what's the next step? Hold a board meeting?

342
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,470
Even if we hold a board meeting and remove He Mingli, what would that do?

343
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,830
You understand your sister's personality well.

344
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,340
Do you think she'd let it go just like that?

345
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,010
But if we don't get rid of my sister, then what about me?

346
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,860
Before we remove her from the chairwoman position,

347
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,710
I have a gift to give you.

348
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,310
What gift?

349
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,870
Director Xu, Tianxing had to clean up the mess for the companies my sister led in the past.

350
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,090
You know this better than anyone else, right?

351
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,770
Uncle Hu, what do you mean by this?

352
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,930
Did you see last quarter's financial report?

353
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,220
I'm sure everyone's well aware how far my sister's abilities extend.

354
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,630
Where did you get this from?

355
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,200
It was on your desk when I got here this morning.

356
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,930
Are they so worried that I wouldn't notice it that they put it directly in my office?

357
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,810
So they clearly want to provoke me.

358
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,260
It's only an audio recording, not a video recording.

359
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,590
It might not really be Young Master.

360
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,830
It is He Tianjian.

361
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,220
My dearest younger brother.

362
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,710
How can I not recognize his voice?

363
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,940
Bring the car.

364
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,490
Yes.

365
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,510
[Tianliang Sakura Shrimp Processing Plant]

366
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,450
Sister, why did you come here?

367
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,340
Director Xu, Tianxing had to clean up the mess for the companies my sister led in the past.

368
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,690
You know this better than anyone else, right?

369
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,540
What's the meaning of this?

370
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,210
Oh, you caught me!

371
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,870
I'm asking you, what's the meaning of this?

372
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,210
Exactly what you heard.

373
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,930
I don't think you're suitable for Tianliang Group's board chair position.

374
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,030
If I'm not suitable, then who is?

375
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:37,920
Tianxing! When he was here, I would always get great dividends every year.

376
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,370
After you took over, I don't even have pocket money anymore.

377
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,140
Our performance this year can't even compare to the same period last year.

378
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,050
Do you want to take a look yourself?

379
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,660
Enough!

380
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,830
Don't make it sound like you can't bear to be without him.

381
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,030
Wake him up now and have him make pocket money for you then!

382
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:13,780
Sorry, this is how cruel reality is.

383
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,400
Yes, this is how cruel reality is.

384
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,570
No matter how hard you work, you can't replace He Tianxing.

385
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,970
Sorry, it's so cruel!

386
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,960
He Tianjian! Be careful with what you say.

387
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,380
Aiyo, did I say something wrong?

388
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,590
Fine, I won't say anything.

389
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,720
But the numbers speak for themselves.

390
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,330
With this attitude of yours, you want to trample over me and take my spot?

391
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,140
Aren't you too naive?

392
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,790
Sis, I don't call the shots on whether I take the position.

393
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,160
It's decided by a board vote.

394
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
You should know that.

395
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,830
Too bad, like you just heard, everyone thinks you're not good enough.

396
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,950
You haven't learned anything, but you are great at backstabbing!

397
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,930
Again? Hitting me when you can't win an argument?

398
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,210
I hit you because you're my younger brother.

399
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,690
If you weren't my brother, I would have killed you already.

400
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,510
Why would I leave a traitor like you to stab me in the back?

401
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,430
You can't kill me, Sis.

402
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,910
Can't you just accept reality?

403
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,800
You'll spend your life paving the way for me.

404
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,830
It sounds kind of sad,

405
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,990
but don't worry, I'll remember everything you've done for me.

406
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,270
Once I officially take over,

407
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,850
I absolutely won't mistreat a competent stepping stone such as yourself.

408
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,990
He Tianjian!

409
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,870
If hitting me can relieve your anger,

410
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,120
then hit me as much as you want.

411
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,760
Besides, the board members have already reached a consensus to support me, not you.

412
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,780
If you have the ability, then beat me to death today.

413
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,830
Otherwise, I will take Tianliang Group from your hands very soon.

414
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,460
Don't think that I won't dare.

415
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,700
If you push me too far, everyone will be destroyed indiscriminately and it will end in mutual destruction!

416
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,910
That's impossible.

417
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,890
You can't bear to die.

418
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,530
The power struggle is too beautiful, isn't it?

419
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,990
He Tianjian!

420
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,590
I won't let you get away with this. Just you wait.

421
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,910
Uncle Hu, did you film it?

422
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,200
Yes, it's all recorded.

423
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,600
CEO, for our hot springs investment project this time,

424
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,880
our marketing department specially created this market

425
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,630
and set up a hot spring corner

426
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,480
for tourists to change into a yukata and take pictures.

427
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,430
Social media hashtags will be used to

428
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,730
promote our upcoming hot spring resort chain.

429
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,330
Which one should I choose?

430
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,900
It's such a difficult choice.

431
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,210
Xiao'en, help me choose.

432
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,980
Just choose the green one.

433
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,600
There is no green one.

434
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,680
Then don’t wear one for now.

435
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,250
Hurry and help me set this up!

436
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,640
My biceps are about to pop out!

437
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,250
Shoot, this is so heavy!

438
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,930
You just found out?

439
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,060
Where is Chuchu?

440
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,900
If she's not out here helping, what is she doing?

441
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,100
I'm afraid I won't be able to make it tonight at eight.

442
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,890
You can just give me the scented wax tablet right now.

443
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,000
But... there's something I'd like to discuss with you.

444
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,030
Would that be inconvenient?

445
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,460
Then alright, I'll see you tonight at eight.

446
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,660
I'm so tired.

447
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,260
What is this?

448
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,670
We open tomorrow. Please come again tomorrow.

449
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,860
Can't you give me special access?

450
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,940
You scared me to death.

451
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,170
Aiyo, it looks like my handsomeness has already advanced to the level of scaring someone to death.

452
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,590
Good afternoon, Young Master.

453
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,150
Qiutian, long time no see!

454
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,160
You've gotten prettier.

455
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,840
I saw you a few days ago.

456
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,240
Miss, am I that scary?

457
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,730
Why do you look like you’ve seen a ghost?

458
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,150
- I’m rather scared of strangers.
- Is that so?

459
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,960
Of course. If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first.

460
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,160
Actually, I happen to have something.

461
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,420
How long have you worked here for?

462
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,670
How come I've never seen you before?

463
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,140
Because I have a very common face, I don't have a very strong presence.

464
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,100
That’s not right. I think you look very familiar.

465
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,210
We must have met before.

466
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,980
At a nightclub? Or a bar?

467
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,980
We didn't have a one night stand, did we? Did we? Did we? Did we?

468
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,870
I’m not so l—

469
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,690
L...?

470
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,260
L-Lucky.

471
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,810
You’ve probably got the wrong person.

472
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,400
So what exactly is the relationship between you and Aoran?

473
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,000
No relationship.

474
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,200
Just the relationship between a boss and an employee!

475
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,030
The boss gives the salary, and the employee receives the salary. It’s that simple.

476
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,650
There’s definitely something fishy.

477
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,440
If what you said is true, why did Aoran

478
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,270
rush out of his office immediately after learning that you fainted?

479
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,430
Is that really true? The CEO rushed out because of me?

480
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,930
You have this expression, and you insist that there’s no relationship?

481
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,020
I just wanted to say,

482
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,060
I’m just a little corporate slave, how could I have alarmed the CEO?

483
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,880
Normal people would be surprised too, isn’t that right?

484
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,960
Yeah, yeah.

485
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,470
I understand. You can get back to work.

486
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,120
Okay.

487
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,340
I don’t care if you want to pick up girls,

488
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,810
but don’t do that to my employee, deal?

489
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,820
First, let’s make it clear. I didn’t do anything.

490
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,070
Wait. When you said “my employee” just now,

491
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,000
why did it sound like you were saying “my woman”?

492
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,050
Is this your woman?

493
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,960
- No.
- No.

494
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,040
So what are you doing here?

495
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,000
Looking for you to treat me to a meal. Are you free?

496
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,710
What do you want to eat? Let’s go.

497
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,030
So tiring.

498
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,950
What?

499
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,930
We have something to say to you.

500
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,250
What are you guys doing?

501
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,710
Speak. What happened?

502
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,380
When did you become the CEO's woman?

503
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,750
What?

504
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,810
Stop pretending otherwise! I heard what both of you were saying just now.

505
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,870
Last time, in the lobby, the CEO walked through a crowd of people

506
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,700
- just to say
- “Good morning” to you.

507
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,740
That's when we knew something fishy was going on with you.

508
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,800
Speak. What exactly is the relationship between you and the CEO?

509
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,230
What? Are you doubting me?

510
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,310
- That's right!
- That's right!

511
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,660
You are really worth doubting.

512
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,800
When we think carefully about it, you have become very strange lately.

513
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,650
Not only do you spend very little time with us,

514
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,710
but you also hang around Chuchu all day!

515
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,410
Now you have even become the CEO’s woman!

516
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,140
What are you guys talking about?

517
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,040
Don’t change the topic!

518
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,730
Say it. What secret are you hiding from us?

519
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,690
- I don’t have any.
- Then do you swear?

520
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,180
Do you dare to swear to us girls?

521
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,440
If you don't dare, then that means you are hiding something.

522
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,430
That's right, you are hiding something from us.

523
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,640
Hurry up and swear.

524
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,210
- Swear, swear, swear.
- Swear, swear, swear.

525
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,770
Xiao'en, do you have time?

526
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,590
Yes! I have lots of time.

527
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,380
Can you check this document for me? It's urgent.

528
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,680
Very urgent, right? No problem. Your wish is my command.

529
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,550
No need to thank me. I'm just doing a good deed every day.

530
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,270
You are really the warm, considerate guy.

531
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,170
Thanks for always coming to my rescue.

532
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,520
Where are you going? I’ll take you there.

533
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,920
I forgot something at the office. Let’s go back to the office.

534
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,090
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

535
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:14,110
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

536
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:20,560
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

537
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,130
Hurry up and swear.

538
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,650
- Swear, swear, swear.
- Swear, swear, swear.

539
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,220
Xiao'en, do you have time?

540
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes! I have lots of time.

541
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,860
Can you check this document for me? It's urgent.

542
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,150
Very urgent, right? No problem. Your wish is my command.

543
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:50,000
No need to thank me. I'm just doing a good deed every day.

544
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,720
You are really the warm, considerate guy.

545
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,650
Thanks for always coming to my rescue.

546
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,000
Where are you going? I’ll take you there.

547
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,180
I forgot something at the office. Let’s go back to the office.

548
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,500
No problem. Your wish is my command.

549
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,290
Why does your complexion look so bad?

550
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,060
What happened to you?

551
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,010
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

552
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,830
I constantly have nightmares.

553
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,290
You're still afraid of the dark?

554
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,560
It's nothing. I'm much better now.

555
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,100
Then that's good.

556
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,740
I remember the prank I liked to pull the most as a kid was turning off the lights to scare you.

557
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,160
It always scared you so badly that you would cry.

558
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,500
Those times can be considered the few times in my life when I felt a sense of accomplishment.

559
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,380
I envied you the most.

560
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,420
In the past, Dad never punished you.

561
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,100
He would only punish me.

562
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,500
That's because Dad only loves you and not me.

563
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,820
I'm just joking.

564
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,180
That's because dad didn't have any hopes for me.

565
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,940
If you were like me and placed last on every test,

566
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,450
he would've quickly given up on you too and not even bothered to punish you.

567
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,290
Your problem is that you're too outstanding.

568
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,280
So that's why Dad kept his attention on you.

569
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,360
You can be like me. Adhere to a consistent set of principles.

570
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,220
I'm just rotten.

571
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,300
See? Hasn't he given up on me?

572
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,450
Eat.

573
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,920
Hey, I recently found a new means of making money.

574
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,480
It's a good investment. Would you be interested?

575
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,230
How much do you need this time?

576
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,630
Two million?

577
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,560
Twenty million.

578
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,790
- It's not impossible.
- That means it's possible!

579
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,110
My Baby Situ, I love you so much!

580
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,910
I promise you, this time it'll definitely make you money and won't be a loss!

581
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,280
Here, I'll toast to you.

582
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,070
Twenty million. You're able to lend it so easily.

583
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,950
Being a CEO must be so nice.

584
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,390
Off work? You've worked hard!

585
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,780
It must be her!

586
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,430
Oh, I bet she has her ways with men.

587
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,170
Why are you back?

588
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,670
- I'm here to pick something up.
- I'm heading out now.

589
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,750
Okay, bye bye.

590
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,880
I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear a thing.

591
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,430
Hello, this is Royal Group.

592
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,980
What?

593
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,690
- Let's have dinner together.
- Oh, I have plans.

594
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,150
Huh?

595
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,430
He has plans? With whom?

596
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,480
Could it be Zheng Xiao'en?

597
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,460
I'm not a stalker.

598
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,300
I just so happen to be hungry too. Right, it's just that.

599
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,530
Hello, what is it?

600
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,660
How could this happen?

601
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,470
We're opening the market tomorrow.

602
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,080
When I was on patrol, I found out that the site had been defaced, so I immediately notified your company.

603
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,140
Do you want to call the police?

604
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,220
If we call the police,

605
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,940
can the police return this to its original state?

606
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:16,520
Aiyo, who in the world did this?

607
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,820
Forget it. Don't worry about it.

608
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,180
I'll deal with it. Thank you for letting me know.

609
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,690
Does the world of romance novels have prayer lanterns?

610
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,580
Things have been too unlucky for me lately.

611
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,360
This is a token of my appreciation. I hope you like it.

612
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,020
Thank you.

613
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,020
You can order as much as you like. I'll treat you today.

614
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,880
What's wrong?

615
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,550
CSO, you are good friends with the CEO.

616
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,190
So you must really understand him, right?

617
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,210
I think so.

618
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,460
Then can you tell me if I did something wrong

619
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,440
that made the CEO unhappy?

620
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,610
Or am I taking too much of the initiative and scaring the CEO?

621
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,910
He seems a bit strange lately.

622
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,000
He's strange?

623
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,910
No. You're doing well.

624
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,700
Do you know what the CEO said about you?

625
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,200
He said you're caring, warm, kind, considerate, elegant, and courteous.

626
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,190
You're also always thinking of others.

627
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,270
Did he really say that?

628
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,360
Yes, so you need to press on and not give up, okay?

629
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,140
Okay.

630
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,760
Only when you're full will you have the strength to pursue true love.

631
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,460
Hurry and order.

632
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:07,150
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

633
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:13,220
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

634
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:19,780
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

635
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,500
CEO!

636
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,930
It's fine now.

637
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,980
Your hand.

638
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:37,660
If I continue to wipe this off, will I tear off your skin?

639
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,120
I'm a man.

640
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,760
Is a skin tear even considered an injury?

641
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,210
Just keep rubbing it clean.

642
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,890
No problem.

643
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,950
This side.

644
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,580
♫ I will accompany you in insomnia ♫

645
00:49:54,580 --> 00:50:01,180
♫ Sleepwalking the whole world together ♫

646
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:05,450
♫ How warm the sun is ♫

647
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,410
♫ Feel it to your heart's content ♫

648
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,780
♫ Got nothing but time ♫

649
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,400
CEO, is this to your satisfaction?

650
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,650
It's passable.

651
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,330
Thank you.

652
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:28,110
♫ You don't need to face everything alone ♫

653
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,620
Come here.

654
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,680
You also knows how to paint?

655
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,670
What's so difficult about it?

656
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,130
What do you not know how to do?

657
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,690
Wiping off the paint from my hands.

658
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,110
Then that's easy.

659
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,300
In the future, you can leave that to me.

660
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,150
Let's get moving.

661
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,960
I thought you had plans with Qingfeng today.

662
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,660
Why?

663
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,580
He said he had dinner plans with someone tonight.

664
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,060
There are a lot of people he can make plans with.

665
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,950
But you're the one he wants to make plans with the most.

666
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,720
Qingfeng and I aren't the way you think we are.

667
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,390
Our relationship is very pure, very sacred,

668
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,980
and very mighty.

669
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,710
It's not that pure.

670
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,920
How is it not pure?

671
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,300
Qingfeng likes you.

672
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,630
You actually believe this?

673
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,390
Why wouldn't I believe it?

674
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,530
It's because I know who he truly likes.

675
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,360
Who?

676
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,820
It's a secret.

677
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,810
You and Qingfeng have progressed to the point of keeping secrets for each other?

678
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,020
Is that not okay?

679
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,480
Oh, right. You had lunch with your brother at noon.

680
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,930
Was everything okay?

681
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,370
It's a secret.

682
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,820
Don't say it if you don't want to.

683
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,300
Guess I worried for nothing.

684
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,940
Why did you call me He Tianxing the first time we met?

685
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,020
Who exactly is He Tianxing?

686
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,110
He's a very special person.

687
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,880
In my heart, he's very important.

688
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,140
He looks similar to me?

689
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,310
So similar! Extremely similar!

690
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:53,640
He's practically 3D-printed to be exactly the same.

691
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,850
Exactly the same?

692
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,940
Do you think it's that easy to have my looks?

693
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,030
How could he look exactly the same?

694
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,980
Next time, why don't you ask him to meet so we can see just how similar we are?

695
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,410
It's not possible.

696
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,010
Why?

697
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,560
- Thank you for dinner.
- Thank you for your gift.

698
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,320
See you tomorrow.

699
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,940
- Hi.
- Hello.

700
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,220
- You know me?
- You're the CEO's brother.

701
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,070
That was Qingfeng, right? You're very close?

702
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,070
We're not close. We're just colleagues.

703
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:17,320
You're not close, yet you can eat together. That's really not close.

704
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,220
Could it be that only the two of you were eating dinner together?

705
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,230
Does Aoran know that you two meet privately?

706
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,970
Sure enough, the overbearing CEO can't handle manual labor with his delicate body.

707
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,250
What's wrong?

708
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,990
Are you okay?

709
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,240
I fell asleep?

710
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:10,910
Yes, right when it was time to work, someone decided to lie flat.

711
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,490
It's been hard for me to fall asleep lately.

712
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:21,990
I didn't expect to be able to fall asleep with you by my side.

713
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:27,510
You had a nightmare?

714
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,340
Yes.

715
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:37,230
Lately, I keep dreaming about being pushed off a building,

716
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,010
so I haven't been sleeping well.

717
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,540
- Being pushed off a building?
- Yes.

718
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,390
Also, I don't know why,

719
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:56,730
but the people in my dream call me He Tianxing, just like you did.

720
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:00,310
♫ Lost to you ♫

721
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:09,490
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

722
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,990
♫ If you were a painter ♫

723
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,280
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

724
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,440
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

725
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,820
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

726
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,370
I fell asleep?

727
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes, right when it was time to work, someone decided to lie flat.

728
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:49,680
It's been hard for me to fall asleep lately.

729
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,110
I didn't expect to be able to fall asleep with you by my side.

730
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,730
You had a nightmare?

731
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,440
Yes.

732
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:09,360
Lately, I keep dreaming about being pushed off a building,

733
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,040
so I haven't been sleeping well.

734
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,960
- Being pushed off a building?
- Yes.

735
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,540
Also, I don't know why,

736
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:29,070
but the people in my dream call me He Tianxing, just like you did.

737
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,000
Xiao'en?

738
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,430
And then what?

739
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:48,180
And then I lied flat on the ground.

740
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,260
And then what?

741
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,610
And then you woke me up.

742
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,950
What else?

743
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,390
- What?
- Your dream!

744
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,240
Why were you pushed off?

745
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,000
Would he tell me the reason for pushing me?

746
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,280
Then, how many people were chasing you?

747
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,640
How did you know I was being chased?

748
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,220
Also, how did you know that it wasn't only one person chasing me?

749
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,110
You just have to clearly explain what you dreamt about.

750
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:28,640
Describe it carefully.

751
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:40,070
I think I was climbing up stairs.

752
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,370
There were people who wouldn't let me go down the stairs, so I ran up.

753
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:51,250
I ran and ran. I don't know why, but I ended up on a rooftop.

754
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:54,690
Then, someone wanted something from me.

755
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,090
What was it?

756
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,220
I don't know.

757
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,380
I just know that I didn't give it to them.

758
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,810
The middle is a little chaotic,

759
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:10,720
but I'm not too sure what we were arguing about.

760
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:22,020
Then, someone kicked me... or pushed me.

761
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,120
After that, I fell off.

762
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:34,370
Do you remember what you were wearing?

763
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,370
Just a suit, no?

764
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:40,260
What color was your suit?

765
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,780
Wine red, I think.

766
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,010
What's wrong?

767
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:02,490
Did you clearly see who pushed you off?

768
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,970
You know who pushed me off?

769
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,020
Who?

770
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,940
Situ Moran.

771
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,070
That's too much of a stretch. He's my brother.

772
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,020
Why would he push me?

773
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,680
- Then—
- Wait.

774
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,960
You're not deliberately trying to drive a wedge between me and my brother, are you?

775
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,470
- Why would I—
- I remember Qingfeng told me...

776
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,620
that you said to be careful of my brother.

777
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:00,430
What exactly are you thinking?

778
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,280
Why are you targeting him like this?

779
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,580
Just... be a bit more careful, okay?

780
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:21,780
That's not right. Isn't this just a dream?

781
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,420
Why am I having a serious discussion with you about it?

782
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,560
And then to drag my brother into it just because of a dream?

783
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,000
Now that's a problem.

784
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:53,690
Is this really a dream?

785
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:02,520
Are you a dream, or am I a dream?

786
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,710
Why did you have to dream about He Tianxing?

787
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,340
Why am I here?

788
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,670
There must be a reason.

789
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,430
What are you doing?

790
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:34,580
Your eyes are filled with sorrow.

791
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,210
Hey.

792
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:41,780
This expression doesn't suit you.

793
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:50,280
Even though you were very bothersome and noisy and loved to talk back,

794
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:56,080
I like the way you were before more.

795
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:00,120
Who wants to be liked by you? Right now I'm...

796
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,980
You really don't want it?

797
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,650
What?

798
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,600
To be liked.

799
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,360
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

800
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:57,480
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

801
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:03,940
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

802
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,710
What are you doing?

803
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:20,510
Your eyes are filled with sorrow.

804
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,470
Hey.

805
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,920
This expression doesn't suit you.

806
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:36,510
Even though you were very bothersome and noisy and loved to talk back,

807
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:41,900
I like the way you were before more.

808
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,340
Who wants to be liked by you? Right now I'm...

809
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,820
♫ Almost losing my soul ♫

810
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,220
You really don't want it?

811
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,590
♫ Silently frozen like a statue ♫

812
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,560
What?

813
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,820
To be liked.

814
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:11,820
♫ The smile hollows out the shell ♫

815
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:18,220
♫ Is the overdue promise to be discarded? ♫

816
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:25,960
♫ Like a sugar-coated lie ♫

817
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:31,300
♫ Brightly yet quietly shouted ♫

818
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:38,610
♫ Let me accompany you in insomnia ♫

819
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:45,290
♫ Sleepwalking the whole world together ♫

820
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:50,380
♫ How warm the sun is ♫

821
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,480
♫ Feel it to your heart's content ♫

822
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,460
♫ Got nothing but time ♫

823
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:06,470
♫ I will accompany you in insomnia ♫

824
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:13,500
♫ You don't need to face everything alone ♫

825
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,090
♫ No matter how hard the pain is, forever ♫

826
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:17,110
I'm sorry.

827
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:25,960
♫ There will be no more parting ♫

828
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,990
♫ Tonight I'm here ♫

829
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:48,920
♫ Fleeting innocence ♫

830
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:55,500
♫ Is like a rope that can't be grabbed, gone with the wind ♫

831
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:58,170
I like Zheng Xiao'en.

832
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:04,240
I, Zheng Xiao'en, have successfully become the overbearing CEO's little rose.

833
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,920
Now I know how blissful it feels to be protected by someone.

834
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,990
May we both be able to be with the ones we like.

835
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:16,190
"Scheming woman seduces the CSO into a love rendezvous in the middle of the night."

836
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,890
There's someone in the company who harbors malicious intentions toward Xiao'en.

837
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:22,950
Shouldn't you pay more attention to her personal safety?

838
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,140
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

839
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:44,190
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

840
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:49,770
♫ A quiet strike ♫

841
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,930
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

842
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:55,250
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

843
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,430
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

844
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:02,740
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

845
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:07,370
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

846
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,580
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

847
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:15,560
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

848
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,270
♫ If I could see you again ♫

849
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:26,960
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

850
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,100
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

851
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:40,360
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

852
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,920
♫ If you were a painter ♫

853
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,070
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

854
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:50,330
♫ No regrets ♫

855
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:56,030
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
