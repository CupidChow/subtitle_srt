00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,340
Is the thief yelling "catch the thief"?

162
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,910
Where did you take him?

163
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,140
You are the one who hired the security guards at the door.

164
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,170
Now that he's missing, you're ask me where he is?

165
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,540
Is it my Chinese that's bad or is it yours?

166
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,980
You're the thief yelling "catch the thief."

167
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,890
You deserved a beating, yet you intentionally made a big deal out of it.

168
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,730
You think others don't know what you're scheming?

169
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,410
Who knows if this is a diversion you've created?

170
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,040
Chairwoman.

171
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,210
What is this?

172
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,180
What's going on here?

173
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,140
I see you're standing here quite comfortably.

174
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,200
You won't take a look at the surveillance cameras to investigate what happened?

175
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,290
Are you waiting for me to go?

176
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,600
What are you laughing at?

177
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm laughing at you.

178
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,290
You think they didn't come prepared?

179
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,860
By the time you finish looking through the hospital surveillance cameras,

180
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,980
who knows where he will have been transported to?

181
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,520
Don't say it like you don't care.

182
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,420
Who was the one that wanted He Tianxing to die back then?

183
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,470
What? After finding out that your name isn't in the will,

184
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,310
you're trying to take his portion?

185
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,440
Aren't you the same?

186
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,350
We're quite similar in this aspect.

187
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,080
We deserve to be called biological siblings.

188
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,810
Unfortunately, the will has been burned into ashes.

189
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,600
You don't have to worry about that.

190
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,740
I'll find other ways to prove the contents of the will.

191
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,750
Whether or not we have the will isn't important.

192
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,080
Don't forget that my last name is also He,

193
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,740
so I naturally have the right of inheritance.

194
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:07,590
And don't forget that I'm the one who's currently in the chairwoman position.

195
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,000
I really don't know where you get your confidence from.

196
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,950
Because He Tianxing isn't dead, your position is stable?

197
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,420
Aiyo, my foolish little brother.

198
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,930
Right now, the one who is anxious is the one who loses.

199
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,060
It appears that the circumstances are still to my favor.

200
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,710
What should we do now?

201
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,350
Should we try to find He Tianxing first?

202
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,190
There's no need for now.

203
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,470
Before, in order to prevent He Tianjian from getting the opportunity to strike,

204
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,770
I had to unlock my phone every few minutes to check on the surveillance feed.

205
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,740
It made me so tense.

206
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,720
Now that there's someone who is voluntarily protecting He Tianxing for me,

207
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,440
I am very relaxed.

208
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,810
Then we're really not concerned about where He Tianxing went?

209
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,840
He Tianjian doesn't know where He Tianxing went,

210
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,090
but I know very well where he is.

211
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,110
Then why did you just—

212
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,730
Think about it.

213
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,060
In this world, who else would want to hide He Tianxing away?

214
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,590
You mean...

215
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,980
We have to hurry. We didn't stall for much time.

216
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,490
[Hipster Fair]

217
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,090
The three-day hipster fair will start today at nine o'clock sharp.

218
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,400
Everyone, confirm your tasks on hand with each other.

219
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,230
When something comes up, immediately inform us in the group chat.

220
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,760
And remember to lower the sound on your phones.

221
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't disturb the guests at our event.

222
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,160
Susan, what's the progress on contacting the press?

223
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,040
The press and influencers have already been sent invitations.

224
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,820
Most have given us positive responses.

225
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,990
Around 10 o'clock, they will arrive on site to take photos.

226
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,120
After a simple interview, a private car will take them to

227
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,870
the hot spring resort for a basic experience.

228
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,600
Was the CEO scheduled to come today?

229
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,090
All right.

230
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,490
Everyone, gather up your energy!

231
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,630
Together, we can make a name for our chain of hot spring resorts.

232
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,330
The CEO said that if the hot spring resort performs well,

233
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,620
Royal Group will increase the year-end bonus this year.

234
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,850
I remember that I didn’t send you a notice today.

235
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,840
What?

236
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,790
I can't come?

237
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,930
You can.

238
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm just curious why you are wasting your morning here

239
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,180
when you have such a packed schedule.

240
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,900
Even if you’re not worried, I’m worried.

241
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,660
Tell me. Why did you come?

242
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,300
I came to help, all right?

243
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,570
You—

244
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,990
I will walk to the left. My left.

245
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,120
Is it swollen?

246
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,820
A little.

247
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,010
What happened between you and Aoran?

248
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,510
How did you know?

249
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,050
At first, I didn’t know.

250
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,750
But once I saw your reaction, I immediately knew.

251
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,710
It must have been something that makes you feel awkward—

252
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,920
No!

253
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Then, it definitely is.

254
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,130
- Could it have been something—
- Who did you go out with last night?

255
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,200
This thing.

256
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,560
- Why does it look a little familiar?
- Give it back to me.

257
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,490
- Let me have a look.
- Give it back to me.

258
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,200
I never thought you’d actually bring it with you!

259
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,340
That’ll do.

260
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,160
Do you like the scent?

261
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,250
If you need anything else, just tell me directly.

262
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,870
Aiyo, not bad.

263
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,190
It’s not like that.

264
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,540
How was it? Were you satisfied with yesterday’s date?

265
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,850
It’s just because this has anti-mosquito properties.

266
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,920
And since Chuchu already gave it to me—

267
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,230
She already gave it to you. She already came to you.

268
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,860
It’s no big deal.

269
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,050
It has been difficult for everyone.

270
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,900
- Stop messing around.
- Just accept it.

271
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,820
Don’t think too much!

272
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,540
Didn’t I tell you to stop messing around?

273
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,530
That’s right.

274
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,570
Seize the opportunity just like this.

275
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,560
Chuchu, thank you for the gift.

276
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,610
I really like it.

277
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,230
You’re too much.

278
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,100
Sit down.

279
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,480
Wasn’t she supporting herself with the pillar just now?

280
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,600
How can a person be more stable than the pillar?

281
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,560
He’s basically performing unnecessary actions.

282
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,480
So you’re here!

283
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
CEO, look.

284
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,860
I’ve been bringing it with me. How about you?

285
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,000
I left it at home.

286
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,550
Then... remember to bring it next time.

287
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,650
Chuchu,

288
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,430
are you free after work today?

289
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,590
I have something to tell you.

290
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:06,210
Based on your expression, you must have something important to tell me.

291
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,950
As long as you want to see me, I am available at any time.

292
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,460
Then I’ll go back to work first.

293
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,520
Come! Come! We have exquisite gifts here!

294
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,230
As long as you check in, you can get the gift!

295
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,670
That Zheng Xiao’en was stealing glances at the CEO throughout the entire event.

296
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,180
Isn't she shameless?

297
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,170
Exactly, and she even purposely moved the boxes to attract the CEO’s attention.

298
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,500
Did she think that no one would see through her charade?

299
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,390
The CEO will never like her!

300
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,020
How can there be such a shameless woman?

301
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,620
Come, say it again right in front of Zheng Xiao’en.

302
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,940
Shameless.

303
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,670
That’s right. Say it once more.

304
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,320
Zheng Xiao’en, you’re shameless!

305
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,570
- You’re the one who’s shameless!
- You’re the one who’s shameless!

306
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,230
You’re talking as if you don’t want to steal glances at the CEO or attract his attention.

307
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,180
What? Xiao’en attracted his attention but you didn’t, so you’re not happy?

308
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,900
If you’re not happy, why don’t you go to the top floor?

309
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,120
Why would I go to the top floor?

310
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,690
Go and shout “I love the CEO” loudly three times.

311
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,410
Let’s see if the CEO will pay any attention to you.

312
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,870
Even the cleaning lady is too lazy to deal with you, okay?

313
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,630
Let’s ignore them.

314
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,620
Are your legs twisted? You’re walking so slowly.

315
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,930
Get out!

316
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,560
Take care! We won’t send you off.

317
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,600
Zheng Xiao’en, are you a fool?

318
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,220
Other people were badmouthing you like this, yet you still wanted to walk away?

319
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,220
Are you still the Zheng Xiao’en we know?

320
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,660
Weren’t you guys also ignoring me yesterday?

321
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,700
Everything that happened yesterday is as if it died yesterday.

322
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,660
Everything that happens today is as if it is born today.

323
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,530
Such olden sayings. I haven't heard those in a while.

324
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,250
Zheng Xiao’en!

325
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,010
Sorry!

326
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,200
I also don’t know why, but it's like I was going around in circles.

327
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,080
After seeing you become closer to the CEO,

328
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,110
I momentarily forgot that we’re friends and suddenly felt very angry.

329
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,370
Me too. After being angry for one day and going home,

330
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,030
I was still behaving strangely at night.

331
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,570
I understand.

332
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,380
Both of you couldn’t help it.

333
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,080
Xiao’en, you’re so nice!

334
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,730
Even though the CEO is important, our friendship is more valuable.

335
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,380
Even if there’s something going on between you and the CEO,

336
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,430
we’ll... we’ll still be good friends.

337
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,270
Even though I'll be frustrated in my heart,

338
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,380
I will still give you my blessings.

339
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,800
Thank you, but you don’t have to be so honest.

340
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,940
Then, forget that part about my frustration toward you.

341
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,270
The important thing is, don’t hide anything from us.

342
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,020
We’ll feel hurt if you treat us like outsiders.

343
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,950
Sorry, I won’t do that next time.

344
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,920
All right, I still have to work overtime.

345
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,770
Help me to make a cup of coffee.

346
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,950
Me too. With ice and no sugar.

347
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,090
Who? Who splashed water on me?

348
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,930
Open the door! Open the door!

349
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,000
What are you doing? Open the door!

350
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,870
What’s been going on lately?

351
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,340
Who exactly did I offend?

352
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,940
Hello!

353
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,970
What is this?

354
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,760
Could it be that after I was kissed by the overbearing CEO,

355
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,760
I got promoted?

356
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,950
Lin Chuntian!

357
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,960
Yes, Chief Editor.

358
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,910
Did you change the parts of the plot as I requested?

359
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,070
I’ve changed it. I’ve removed Xiao’en’s name.

360
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,420
As for the plot, I’ve asked the author to make changes.

361
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,860
Don’t make any mistakes.

362
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,030
Of course, of course.

363
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,750
As for Xiao’en...

364
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,570
She will definitely get better!

365
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,290
I know.

366
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,380
But Boss said that her position cannot be left empty.

367
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,990
He wanted me to find someone online.

368
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,890
How can you do this? Xiao’en is not intentionally missing work.

369
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,670
How can the company abandon her at this time?

370
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,010
Are you guys even human beings?

371
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,570
Of course I’m a human being!

372
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,810
That’s why I refused.

373
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,320
Chief Editor.

374
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,510
Since I’m not looking for someone new,

375
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,860
before Xiao’en recovers, you will have to work harder.

376
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,460
You'll have to do the work of two people.

377
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,490
You’re saying that as if that’s not usually the case.

378
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,480
No problem. Thank you, Chief Editor.

379
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,130
Ah, sorry!

380
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,850
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

381

383

Ah, sorry!

384
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,300
Is it because I miss Zheng Xiao’en too much?

385
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,910
Is anyone there?

386
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,000
Is it possible that no one will pass by?

387
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,320
Hello, CEO. This is the security office.

388
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,560
What’s the matter?

389
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,440
I'm reporting on this week's surveillance of Miss Zheng Xiao'en from the marketing department.

390
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,780
This week, Miss Zheng—

391
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,590
Never mind. You don’t have to keep an eye on her anymore.

392
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,180
Okay. Alright, I understand.

393
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,280
- Then...
- Is there anything else?

394
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,160
Miss Zheng Xiao'en entered the women's restroom half an hour ago, but she hasn't emerged since then.

395
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,010
I'm not sure what happened.

396
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,250
Are you all right?

397
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,260
Xiao’en?

398
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,960
You...

399
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,630
Why are you the one who’s here?

400
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,260
The security guard said that someone was trapped in the restroom.

401
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,990
Then did the security guard say that it was me who was trapped in the restroom?

402
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,020
I think... he did.

403
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,190
So you immediately ran over to save me?

404
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,470
I wouldn’t say it was “immediately.”

405
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,590
It’s just that...

406
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:16,320
Once I got off the phone, my feet slowly stepped forward.

407
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,050
I slowly stepped out of the office.

408
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:24,750
My hand slowly pressed the elevator...

409
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,970
What’s wrong?

410
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,470
So you knew it was me, yet you still came to save me?

411
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,950
Then why are you crying?

412
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,020
You’re mistaken.

413
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:54,230
It’s just that my long-anticipated dream has finally come true.

414
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,480
Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.

415
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,960
Weirdo.

416
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,750
- Yesterday, you—
- Yesterday, you—

417
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,400
- You go first.
- You go first.

418
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,730
Can I ask

419
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,000
why you kissed me yesterday?

420
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,000
I don’t know.

421
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,970
Oh.

422
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,790
Then if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to the office first.

423

Splashing water on you in the restroom is such an old tactic.

00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,300
Isn't it low level? Isn't it childish?

451
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,410
I'm talking about bullying others out of jealousy.

452
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,490
Do they have any standards?

453
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,660
No, we're all coworkers.

454
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,950
Is there a point in doing something shady?

455
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,630
Director! Director!

456
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,240
Hey, why is your face so red?

457
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,890
You're mistaken.

458
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,320
It really is red.

459
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,330
That's from the director wiping it.

460
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,430
I wiped your head, not your face.

461
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,140
Director, I think we definitely have to take revenge for Xiao'en.

462
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:54,320
That's right. Today, I'll go to the security room and get the security footage.

463
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,970
That's not necessary.

464
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,480
I fell for the trap because I wasn't checking.

465
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,150
I won't fall for it again.

466
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,060
You really won't?

467
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,520
I really won't.

468
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,830
Is she kind of weird today?

469
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,040
That's right. She didn't even greet us.

470
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,690
After seeing her coworker like this, she doesn't even come over to express concern.

471
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,940
Is it possible that seeing me like this brings back bad memories?

472
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,320
[Aoran: Are you off work yet?]

473
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,610
[Chuchu: Sorry, we're still working late.]

474
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:25,210
[I'm a little tired today. Can we meet up another day?]

475
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,110
[Okay.]

476
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,920
Do you have time tonight?

477
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,990
I do have time.

478
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,660
I'm going to go to the hospital to see my father first,

479
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,130
and then I'll come see you later.

480
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,340
Where did you just go?

481
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,200
I've been waiting for your signature.

482
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,840
Xiao'en just got locked in the bathroom and had water splashed all over her.

483
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,400
Zheng Xiao'en?

484
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,940
Yeah.

485
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,500
Not Chuchu?

486
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,830
Not Chuchu.

487
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,620
So you went to the restroom to save her just now?

488
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,240
That's right.

489
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,000
This kind of thing shouldn't happen to her.

490
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,690
Why?

491
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,780
Because...

492
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,140
I don't know how to explain it.

493
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,060
Anyway, it's just not right. Completely not right.

494
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,410
I'm finally all dry and clean.

495
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,650
I've also finished preparing everything here. Come eat.

496
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,450
- This is...
- Take out.

497
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,440
I didn't know what you wanted to eat, so I just ordered whatever.

498
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,830
Wow. Can we be more low key here?

499
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,970
Low key?

500
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:22,730
Never mind. Then, next time, I want lobster for a midnight snack.

501
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,020
- I can order that right now.
- That's not necessary.

502
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,720
Don't force me to die all at once.

503
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,460
- Who locked you inside?
- I don't know.

504
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,850
- I'll find out for you.
- No, that's okay.

505
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,320
- But...
- It's really okay.

506
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,230
Before, I would've never had the fortune of being locked in a restroom.

507
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,290
You also know who it all happened to.

508
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,750
So...

509
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:05,150
So it means that my, Zheng Xiao'en's, revolution is successful.

510
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,940
I've successfully become...

511
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,000
the overbearing CEO's little rose.

512
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,850
It's not funny?

513
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,060
How are you sure?

514
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:33,070
Of course it was the moment when I saw the overbearing CEO appear.

515
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,620
I originally believed that no matter what happened,

516
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,610
I could hang in there on my own.

517
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,270
The moment that Boss appeared,

518
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:54,140
my heart felt a sense of security.

519
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:01,760
Now I know how blissful it feels to be protected by someone.

520
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:21,750
You see? Even with me like this, I can see a shadow of hope.

521
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,800
You also can't give up.

522
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,770
Our hard work won't betray us.

523
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,520
Making an effort will yield results.

524
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,800
I'm thankful that you and I are fighting together in this world.

525
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,030
May we both be able to be with the ones we like.

526
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,130
May we both find the happiness that we want.

527
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,340
Well said! Cheers!

528
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:04,990
Wow, I can really feel how hard you want to work for it.

529
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:07,090
Drink slower.

530
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,500
I actually...

531
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,050
Okay. I will go all out with you.

532
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,410
This time, we'll really empty our glasses.

533
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,290
Hey, gently, gently.

534
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,970
I drank until even my peripheral nerves became numb.

535
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,240
You're thinking too much.

536
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,210
You just drank too much. Go back up.

537
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:15,400
You too. Your substitute driver should be here soon.

538
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,440
Be careful on your way home.

539
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,590
♫ Lost to you ♫

540
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:28,810
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

541
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:32,270
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

542
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:38,330
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

543
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:44,830
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

544
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,180
Hey, gently, gently.

545
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,740
I drank until even my peripheral nerves became numb.

546
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,050
You're thinking too much.

547
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,460
You just drank too much. Go back up.

548
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,240
You too. Your substitute driver should be here soon.

549
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,940
Be careful on your way home.

550
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,100
What is this?

551
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,010
Why are you giving me money?

552
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,290
My dad's medical fees.

553
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,520
Huh?

554
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,360
Didn't we originally decide not to bother the CEO with this?

555
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,830
If you really wanted to help me, then fine.

556
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,890
Why did you drag the CEO into this?

557
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,290
And you even took his money.

558
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,320
Huh?

559
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,590
I thought you simply wanted to help me.

560
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,980
I never thought you would bring the CEO to the hospital

561
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,620
and let him know that my family owed money.

562
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,480
In front of him, I don't even have a bit of pride anymore.

563
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,030
Why did you do that?

564
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:26,290
I'm sorry. I really didn't know things would turn out this way.

565
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,380
But don't worry, I haven't cashed the CEO's check yet.

566
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,930
Strictly speaking, it can't be counted as taking his money.

567
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:39,090
Then in the future, don't accept whatever he gives you.

568
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:48,610
So where did you get this money from?

569
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,490
I recently found a decent part-time job.

570
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:04,090
Anything that can be solved isn't considered a problem.

571
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,990
That's great!

572
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,930
Do you really think this way?

573
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,430
Of course! No one likes the feeling of owing money.

574
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:21,940
Ah, it's the CEO again.

575
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,400
Recently, the CEO keeps asking to meet up with me.

576
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,020
It feels like he wants to tell me something important.

577
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,480
Is that right?

578
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:40,490
But I think that only half of men's words should be trusted.

579
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:43,670
Men, such as the CEO, who have so many great qualities

580
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:47,690
surely wouldn't wholeheartedly treat only one person well.

581
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,990
What do you think?

582
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,750
Forget it. I'm going to trust the CEO.

583
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,260
I trust that he'll treat only me well.

584
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:06,680
Xiao'en, will you continue to give me your blessings as you did before?

585
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:11,050
Of course I hope everyone can be happy, but I think that—

586
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:16,960
I hope that you are truly and sincerely supporting me.

587
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,530
What situation is this right now?

588
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,090
The overbearing CEO kissed me.

589
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,040
It probably means he likes me, right?

590
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,350
Then does he feel the same way about me and Chuchu?

591
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,420
Then what about Qingfeng?

592
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,750
Qingfeng and Chuchu should have a chance now, right?

593
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,580
- Good morning, CEO. Good morning, CSO.
- Good morning, CEO. Good morning, CSO.

594
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,980
Good morning, Xiao'en.

595
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,920
Good morning, Qingfeng.

596
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,000
Hello, CEO.

597
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,060
How come I only get the one-word "hello"

598
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,880
and Duanmu gets the two-word "good morning"?

599
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,410
And why does she call him "Qingfeng"?

600
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:58,930
- Xiao'en yesterday—
- Yesterday, did you get home okay?

601
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,230
Yes.

602
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,690
- Let's go.
- Make coffee.

603
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,320
What are you doing? What are you doing?

604
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,430
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

605
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,270
- What's going on?
- Just come with us.

606
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,340
Someone posted this on our company's internal website.

607
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,970
Do you know what the headline is?

608
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:42,940
"Scheming woman seduces the CSO into a love rendezvous in the middle of the night."

609
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,400
- Huh?
- What are you saying "huh" for?

610
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,200
Huh, there are too many things happening lately that I just don't understand.

611
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,780
Do you know how much hatred you've accumulated at the company?

612
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,320
How much?

613
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,670
Ten minutes ago, in our latest internal opinion poll,

614
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,360
Marketing Department's Zheng Xiao'en

615
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,860
defeated the tenth consecutive winner, Accounting Department's reimbursement cashier,

616
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,590
and become our Royal Group's champion for being the most loathsome person.

617
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,240
- Then, what about Chuchu?
- At the highest, she was second.

618
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,180
- Then I—
- Completely defeated Chuchu.

619
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,220
I'm more hateful than the white lotus?

620
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,670
[Chuchu: CEO, do you know what's going on with this?]

621
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,540
[Scheming woman seduces the CSO into a love rendezvous in the middle of the night]

622
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,690
What's going on here?

623
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,310
[Scheming woman seduces the CSO into a love rendezvous in the middle of the night]

624
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:59,010
It is as the pictures depict.

625
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,360
Why did you go looking for her?

626
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,320
Of course I had a reason to look for her.

627
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,260
What? I can't go look for her?

628
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,840
It's not that you can't.

629
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,920
Then, what did you guys talk about?

630
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,290
- It's a secret.
- I knew it.

631
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:19,450
Not bad, you've improved.

632
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,620
But instead of why I went to find Zheng Xiao'en,

633
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,490
shouldn't you be more concerned about her?

634
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,750
Two things.

635
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:34,430
First, why would someone take these photos

636
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,490
and deliberately spread them around?

637
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,200
It means there's someone in the company who harbors malicious intentions toward Xiao'en.

638
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,370
Second, after seeing these photos,

639
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,630
the number of people who hate Xiao'en will increase.

640
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,930
Xiao'en's days in the company surely won't be good.

641
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:52,210
Shouldn't you be paying more attention to her safety?

642
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,370
You're right.

643
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:00,480
Have you ever thought about why you suddenly gave up on Chuchu?

644
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:08,490
No worries, I was just suddenly curious.

645
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,020
Connect me to the security office.

646
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:33,500
More importantly, what plans do you have for Zheng Xiao'en?

647
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,340
I must say... why are you acting so close with the CSO right now?

648
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:44,320
From getting transferred to the top floor, leaving the company, returning to the company,

649
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,170
and then exchanging flirtatious glances with the CEO,

650
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,040
that's when you started getting hate.

651
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,260
How you're acting right now will make others feel

652
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:54,720
that you want to scoop up the CEO, and two-time with the CSO.

653
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,520
Can I still run away?

654
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,180
Why're you running? You have me.

655
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,120
I'm a director. I'll protect you.

656
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,860
Sisters, then I can only depend on you.

657
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,280
No worries, let's pick up our energy!

658
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,630
We are ready for the women's battle.

659
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,160
[Hipster Fair]

660
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,940
You guys are ready? Come. This way, please.

661
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,700
Be careful.

662
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,600
The director asked you to come here? That's wonderful.

663
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,540
Both of you, please follow this pretty girl to have a look around.

664
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,190
This way, please.

665
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:01,270
Hurry up! The visitors are short on time.

666
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,080
[Laxative]

667
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,000
Sister Xiao'en, you must be thirsty. Have a sip of this drink.

668
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,990
Thank you.

669
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,130
I have fast reflexes, don't I?

670
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,260
Smile.

671
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,550
Hey, wait!

672
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,100
There are too many people. The elevator won't close.

673
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:54,440
It smells really bad. Who farted?

674
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,350
Was it you?

675
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,340
That's right. Why don't you hurry up and get out?

676
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,370
She really knows how to protect herself.

677
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:20,240
I shouldn't have listened to you and tried to protect her.

678
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,260
It was more like she should be protecting me.

679
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,960
What can be done when the male lead has no room to live up to his potential?

680
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:42,510
Everyone, you've worked hard. It's finally over.

681
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,690
Then, can we all change into yukatas and take a group photo?

682
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:49,460
- Can we do that?
- I really want to wear one!

683
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,400
Alright then. Everyone, change into a yukata you like.

684
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,370
- Thank you!
- I want this one!

685
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,340
I want this one!

686
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,430
This one!

687
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,610
- This one's for me!
- This one is mine!

688
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,990
- Give it back to me!
- This one fits me well!

689
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,320
It fits me better!

690
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,850
Not even!

691
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:10,670
Everyone, smile. One, two, three.

692
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,730
Everyone, you've worked hard. Hurry and clean up.

693
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:18,580
The CEO said he would treat everyone to dinner tonight.

694
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,980
Thank you, CEO. Thank you, CSO.

695
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,080
Hurry up and change.

696
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,500
- Okay, hurry up. What are we eating?
- What do you want to eat?

697
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,410
Xiao'en.

698
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,260
- What?
- You've worked hard.

699
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,930
You've worked hard too. Hurry up and change your clothes.

700
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,970
You too.

701
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:49,930
You've worked hard.

702
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,740
Let's do it together.

703
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,080
It's alright.

704
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,940
Isn't there unfinished business over there with the director? Go help her.

705
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,920
I'll finish tidying this up soon.

706
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,620
Xiao'en.

707
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:09,710
Don't worry, I've attained the overbearing CEO and the CSO.

708
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:14,350
I've ascended to first place as the queen of being the most hated woman in the company.

709
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:17,870
Then, I'll head over to the director.

710
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,940
Why are you here?

711
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,260
♫ Lost to you ♫

712
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:07,030
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

713
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:10,360
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

714
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:16,450
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

715
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:22,960
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

716
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,590
Why are you here?

717
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:48,110
Did you... have something to ask me yesterday morning?

718
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:56,010
I wanted to ask you something yesterday?

719
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,910
Let's take a picture.

720
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,940
I didn't really get to participate in the company's event.

721
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:14,880
But the clothes are already—

722
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,390
Okay, it's fine. Let's just take it like this.

723
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,590
Okay.

724
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,070
I'll take it for you.

725
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:40,740
Look this way. One, two, three...

726
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,430
Look at the camera and smile.

727
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,890
What do you think?

728
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:28,630
Can I get these pictures from you?

729
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,290
Okay.

730
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,950
It's done.

731
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:46,260
- Hello?
- Where are you?

732
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,160
Didn't you say you'd go to the restaurant with everyone?

733
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,920
Hurry up. We're waiting for you.

734
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,950
Got it.

735
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,030
You go first. Everyone's waiting for you.

736
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,530
Okay.

737
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,000
Why did you come back?

738
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,780
If I didn't come, would I be able to clearly see your two-faced true colors?

739
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,650
You're the most shameless person I've ever met.

740
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,550
You support me on the surface, but you seduce him behind my back.

741
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:40,300
You purposely sent the others away so that you could take a photo with the CEO, right?

742
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,650
I really wasn't supporting you on the surface and pulling dirty tricks behind your back. I was—

743
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,130
I don't need your explanation.

744
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:52,240
I just want you to leave the CEO, leave the CSO, leave the company, and leave the further, the better!

745
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,560
What's going on?

746
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:22,470
Zheng Xiao'en... Zheng Xiao'en hit me.

747
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,400
You're the one I like, Situ Aoran.

748
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,820
You're no one's substitute.

749
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,710
You're one of a kind.

750
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,990
I just want to scare Zheng Xiao'en so that she'll stay away from the CEO.

751
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,730
Give Situ Aoran a call.

752
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:49,100
Tell him that Zheng Xiao'en is here.

753
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,900
Don't worry, I'll definitely save you this time.

754
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:56,020
I absolutely won't let you get hurt.

755
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,530
Where's Zheng Xiao'en? Don't hurt her.

756
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:01,770
You can't even fend for yourself, and you're in the mood to worry about her?

757
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,580
Looks like it's true love.
