00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,620
Wow, I was this tall at six years old?

166
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,090
Who is it?

167
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,260
It's me.

168
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,960
It's me.

169
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,050
I finally found you.

170
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sure Chuntian already asked you,

171
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,440
but I still want to confirm it for myself.

172
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,520
Are you okay?

173
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,880
I don't know why,

174
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,230
but after the orphanage director passed away,

175
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,710
I feel as if

176
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,610
my past has been completely erased.

177
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,110
After the orphanage shut down,

178
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,280
all our information disappeared with it.

179
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,180
The only person who remembers how I came here

180
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,310
and how I grew up was the director, who's also gone.

181
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,990
My childhood

182
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,580
seems to have been deleted completely

183
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,090
with the press of a button today.

184
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,780
I understand that feeling.

185
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,210
Ever since my mom passed away,

186
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,200
it seems like a period was drawn

187
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,430
to end my childhood that day.

188
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,170
Do you still remember things from when you were young?

189
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,490
I want to hear you talk about them.

190
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,460
My childhood is really boring. You won't want to hear about it.

191
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,420
As long as it's about you, I'll want to hear about it.

192
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,540
The more, the better.

193
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,890
Because as long as there's still someone in this world

194
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,310
who remembers those things,

195
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,990
your childhood will never be erased.

196
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,960
You're willing to remember these things for me?

197
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,720
I remember I participated in a singing competition when I was a kid.

198
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,060
Someone chose the same song as I did.

199
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,560
In the end, she got first place.

200
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,590
I got second place.

201
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,730
The orphanage director said I sang it best,

202
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,240
but her dance was better.

203
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,110
Wasn't it a singing competition?

204
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,210
It's not like it was a dancing competition.

205
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,060
First place should've gone to the one who sang it best.

206
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,970
Right?

207
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,180
She was pretty and also the class leader.

208
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,770
She had parents who loved her,

209
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,990
and I...

210
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,280
I, He Tianxing,

211
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,070
hereby announce that

212
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,670
the winner of this children's singing competition is...

213
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,240
Zheng Xiao'en.

214
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,200
Hello, teachers, family members...

215
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:19,020
Hello, teachers and classmates.

216
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,220
I am Situ Aoran.

217
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,030
What I want to share with everyone today is

218
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,670
if I had a superpower...

219
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,750
Not just this singing competition,

220
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,970
no matter what competition it is, the winner is Zheng Xiao'en.

221
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,240
It can only be Zheng Xiao'en.

222
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,350
It can't be anyone else.

223
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,100
What I say goes.

224
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,970
Our Aoran is so great.

225
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,000
Hey, that's my husband.

226
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,650
Congratulations. You're the best.

227
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,380
You're number one in the whole world.

228
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,090
He's number one in the whole world.

229
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,980
No, number one in the whole universe.

230
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,500
No, number one in the whole universe.

231
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,790
♫ Silently frozen like a statue ♫

232
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:43,970
♫ The smile hollows out the shell ♫

233
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:50,370
♫ Is the overdue promise to be discarded? ♫

234
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:58,040
♫ Like a sugar-coated lie ♫

235
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,240
♫ Brightly yet quietly shouted ♫

236
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,740
What's wrong?

237
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't be so nice to me.

238
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,850
What's wrong? Weren't we fine just now?

239
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,400
I already said, don't be so nice to me.

240
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,940
Can you stay away from me?

241
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,100
Why?

242
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,740
Don't be like this. Don't make me confused.

243
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,590
Don't...

244
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,600
♫ Got nothing but time ♫

245
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,580
♫ I will accompany you in insomnia ♫

246
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,430
♫ You don't need to face everything alone ♫

247
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,210
Don't make me fall in love with you.

248
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,910
You're the one who confused me first.

249
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,090
Who was the one who first spied on me,

250
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,840
got close to me,

251
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,120
prayed for me when I got hurt,

252
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,460
and cried for me when something happened to me?

253
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,580
Who was it?

254
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,090
You. It was you.

255
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,510
You've done so much for me,

256
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,570
and now you're telling me that you don't want to fall in love with me?

257
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,670
Okay, that's fine.

258
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,700
You don't love me?

259
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,820
Then let me love you.

260
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,900
I used to think that I had a heart of stone,

261
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,940
that I was invulnerable.

262
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,240
Until I met you.

263
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,740
The way you gazed at me made me realize

264
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,940
that all of my strength in the past

265
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,110
was just me trying to be brave.

266
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,160
It turns out I've been hoping

267
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,050
that someone will find out I've been pretending.

268
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,340
You're the one who saw through my pretense

269
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,970
and made me feel emotions I've never felt before.

270
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,980
Zheng Xiao'en.

271
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,470
You must take responsibility.

272
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,080
♫ Nothing but a broken heart ♫

273
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,410
♫ Please talk to me ♫

274
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,960
♫ I would put a smile through your tears ♫

275
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,680
♫ Let me kiss goodbye on your cheeks ♫

276
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,550
♫ And go on and on ♫

277
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,160
♫ I would put a smile through your tears ♫

278
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,810
♫ Let me kiss goodbye on your cheeks ♫

279
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:14,680
♫ And go on and on and on ♫

280
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,770
Hello?

281
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,870
Zheng Xiao'en, where did you go?

282
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,890
Do you know that the whole world is looking for you?

283
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,810
I went to Yongxin Orphanage.

284
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,980
You should've told me to go with you.

285
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,260
Why did you go by yourself?

286
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,430
Did you go there to cry secretly?

287
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,210
Am I the kind of person who would secretly cry?

288
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,580
You are.

289
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,610
Hey, let me tell you something.

290
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,930
It seems He Tianxing was looking for you today.

291
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,520
He even called me. It was unbelievable.

292
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,240
Remember to send him a text.

293
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,800
Don't make him worry about you for no reason.

294
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,300
Okay, I know. Bye.

295
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,510
Sorry.

296
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,120
Be careful when you're driving.

297
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,220
Xiao'en.

298
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,310
If you're ever in a bad mood or upset, come to me.

299
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,240
Don't disappear on your own, okay?

300
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,800
♫ Lost to you ♫

301
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,310
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

302
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,660
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

303
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,710
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

304
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:18,150
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

305
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,130
If you're ever in a bad mood or upset, come to me.

306
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,400
Don't disappear on your own, okay?

307
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,970
Xiao'en...

308
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,530
Thank you so much for today.

309
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,560
It's quite late, and I'm a bit tired.

310
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,530
You should get back quickly to get some sleep too.

311
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,000
Come find me anytime you need anything.

312
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,340
Why weren't you answering your phone?

313
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,840
I sent someone to go to the florist today

314
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,250
to review Hu Chaoqin's orders from the past few months.

315
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,100
Wow! The CEO's cedar reed diffuser isn't just a fragrance.

316
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,700
It also uses natural essential oils to produce a relaxing, stress-relieving effect.

317
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,400
You've never smelled it from this close of a distance, right?

318
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,010
Jason.

319
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,000
I was only sharing this with you because I really think this is a good product.

320
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,970
You took Tianxing to see Zheng Xiao'en just now?

321
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,950
- Yes.
- Why?

322
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,600
I-I don't know.

323
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,090
Okay, fine.

324
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,080
Let's stop being friends then.

325
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,420
You won't want to hear it.

326
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,540
I want to hear it. I want to hear it right now!

327
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,990
Okay! The CEO likes Zheng Xiao'en.

328
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,350
That's not possible.

329
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,880
How is it not possible? In the car, I personally saw them—

330
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,010
Saw what?

331
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,750
Hold hands.

332
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,770
It's obvious they accidentally touched each other.

333
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,440
It really wasn't.

334
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,430
It's obvious Zheng Xiao'en took the initiative.

335
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,760
That's not true either.

336
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,990
It's obvious that...

337
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,010
I'm lying to myself.

338
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,080
I told you that you wouldn't want to hear it,

339
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,150
yet you insisted that I tell you.

340
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,250
Whatever. It's fine as long as he's happy.

341
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,070
It's none of my business.

342
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,720
Are you okay?

343
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,330
No, I'm not.

344
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,380
But I'll be fine one day.

345
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,290
If this happened three months ago,

346
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,950
I definitely would've wanted to flip a table.

347
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,280
I've liked Tianxing since college.

348
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,000
Who stayed by his side and faced off with everyone involved with the power struggle at the company?

349
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,560
It was me.

350
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,900
But why did my place get taken by Zheng Xiao'en who appeared out of nowhere?

351
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,530
Love is not “first come, first serve.”

352
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,100
And you don't necessarily win just because you put in the most.

353
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,260
I know.

354
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,050
But I thought I'd win him over one day.

355
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,300
But after Tianxing got into an accident,

356
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,440
I realized that as long as he wakes up,

357
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,430
nothing else was important.

358
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,960
But your heart hurts, right?

359
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,150
If it didn't hurt, it wouldn't be called love.

360
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,970
Isn't this what it's like to like someone?

361
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,190
As long as he is okay, then I'm okay too.

362
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,860
So you really like the CEO?

363
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,690
So what?

364
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,730
At least Zheng Xiao'en has the guts to face it head on.

365
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,200
And me?

366
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,020
I didn't even have the courage to tell him.

367
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,250
What are you doing?

368
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,600
Are you crazy?!

369
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,660
I'm not crazy, but I'm full of love.

370
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,630
You're the one who said that if I didn't even have the courage to say it out loud,

371
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,970
then of course I'd never win.

372
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,670
So I mustered up the courage.

373
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,610
I said to say it out loud, not to kiss!

374
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,560
Gosh! It is because I haven't scolded you in a while?

375
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,170
How dare you! How dare you! How dare you!

376
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,430
Who led you astray?

377
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,300
It's an overbearing CEO's exclusive privilege to go in for a kiss when a conversation doesn't sit right.

378
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,520
I'm warning you!

379
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,830
Next time, you're not allowed to touch me without my permission!

380
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,070
So... if I have your permission, then it's okay?

381
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,920
Don't twist my words!

382
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,570
Hey, if I disappear, would you look for me?

383
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,810
I will, to see if you've been made into a piece of wave absorber!

384
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,860
(It means getting tossed into the ocean. It's often used as a threat by Taiwanese gangsters.)

385
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,900
I've discovered something.

386
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,000
What?

387
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,590
It hurts when you hit me.

388
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,600
If it didn't hurt, it wouldn't be called love.

389
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,040
So this is love.

390
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,160
You're seriously crazy!

[Blaze of Colors Florist]
[Order Details from August to October]

399
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,420
This is the list of orders from the flower shop?

400
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,980
I conducted an audit.

401
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,550
Hu Chaoqin ordered flowers seven times in the past three months.

402
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,490
Three of the orders were made in the company's name.

403
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,050
For example, he sent flowers to Director Hao's son for his piano recital

404
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,960
and to Director Lin's daughter for winning a calligraphy contest.

405
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,600
He put good work into public relations.

406
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,320
What about the remaining four orders?

407
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,450
The remaining four orders were sent to Caijing Gallery.

408
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,320
It's important to note that the flowers that were sent to the gallery were paid for by himself.

409
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,980
Do we need to ponder over something so simple?

410
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,720
Hu Chaoqin must have opened that gallery for his mistress.

411
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,950
That's not impossible.

412
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,360
That must be it.

413
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,680
Many galleries have some chairman as their financial backer.

414
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,050
They open galleries for their mistresses.

415
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,520
It's an easy job with flexible hours.

416
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,300
So the owner of that Caijing Gallery must be Hu Chaoqin's first or second mistress.

417
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,700
Maybe her name is Caijing!

418
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,310
What is it?

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,730
Later, someone's going to help us verify

420
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,720

That's not it.

426
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,790
He's not good at kissing?

427
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,540
That's not the problem.

428
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,140
Then what's the problem?

429
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,140
The problem is...

430
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,890
There's no problem.

431
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,380
If it's not a problem with He Tianxing,

432
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,290
then it's a problem with you!

It's not that you can't; it's that you don't want to.

He Tianxing has given you the green light.

437

If you wanted to be with him,

438
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,840
after you guys kissed yesterday,

439
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,800
you would've said "Chuntian, let me tell you!"

440
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,530
"Spring has really come for me!"
(Chuntian means spring)

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,370
But you didn't.

442
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,130
I also thought that I'd be really happy,

443
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,500
but I'm not.

444

With my current feelings,

445
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,870
I don't think it’s right for me to start a new relationship.

446
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,500
Is it because of Situ Aoran?

447

Zheng Xiao'en, it's 2020.

448
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,890
The days of Situ are long gone; his archetype remains in the past. (Play on a Chinese idiom)

449
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,330
You can cherish the memory of him in your heart,

450
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,380
but you don't need to have a chastity arch for him.

451
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,860
Situ Aoran is not a real person, is not a real person, is not a real person.

452
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,890
You must say important things three times.

453
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,790
This is not where you apply your morals.

454
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,710
He Tianxing is right before your eyes. Isn't it a waste if you just let him go like that?

455
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,750
Can’t you just treat it like you’re starting a second youth after being widowed?

456
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,150
Do I look like someone with such a strong sense of morality?

457
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,410
That's true. So why?

458
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,860
I thought if someone tossed a piece of steak like He Tianxing at you,

459
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,960
you would jump on it without hesitation.

460
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,590
I thought so too.

461
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,150
But when it actually happened,

462
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,060
I understood then

463
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,590
that there's just one thing I can't get past.

464
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:52,970
I keep remembering the feeling of heartache.

465
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:02,760
To me, Situ Aoran was real.

466
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,000
The pain from separating with him is also real.

467
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,720
So He Tianxing has become the fake one instead?

468
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,110
Maybe I’m projecting my feelings,

469
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:26,730
so I’m treating He Tianxing as Situ Aoran.

470
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,510
This isn't fair.

471
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,570
Then why did you say it has nothing to do with your sense of morality?

472
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,860
Of course, I’m also doing it for myself.

473
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,370
He Tianxing and Situ Aoran are like a loop.

474

If I keep getting entangled like this,

475
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,030
I feel like I'm being trapped in the same place.

Is there something you want to eat? I'll get someone to buy it.

488
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,950
No, it's okay. Thank you.

489
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,320
This is the last time, and we don't have a lot of time.

490
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,000
Let's get right to it.

491
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,760
Okay, let's begin.

492
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,090
The interview officially ends here.

493
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,570
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview with us.

494
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,820
After that, we will sort out the first draft and send it to your secretary’s office for review.

495
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,670
After you guys confirm that there aren't any problems, we’ll get ready to publish the book.

496
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,980
Xiao'en.

497
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,840
Do you have any other instructions?

498
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,910
No.

499
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,330
Zheng Xiao'en.

500
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,940
Are you free later?

501
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,650
Sorry, I'm a bit busy.

502
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,750
There's no need to invite me to lunch.

503
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,490
I’m not asking you out for a meal.

504
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,900
I'd like your help with something else.

505
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:09,960
Later, just do as I say.

506
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,750
If there are any problems, signal me with hand gestures.

507
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,670
You can get out of the car now.

508
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,150
There isn't a single customer here.

509
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,450
Miss, what are you looking for?

510
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,890
Is your boss here?

511
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,670
I'm the boss.

512
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,060
Director Hu's mistress?

513
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,490
Where's the mistress you talked about?

514
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,340
Maybe it's a mister.

515
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,770
Tell him there's a famous painting you want to buy.

516
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,460
There's a famous painting I want to buy.

517
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,370
Mr. Hu told me to come here.

518
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,320
Who?

519
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,550
Tianliang Group's Director Hu. Hu Chaoqin.

520
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,010
I don't know him.

521
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,580
He doesn't seem to be lying.

522
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,030
Maybe Uncle Hu never showed his face here?

523
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,050
She's coming out.

524
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,330
What are you looking at? The sun is blazing.

525
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,860
There's nothing else you need me to do, right?

526
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,990
Thank you.

527
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,680
I can do it myself.

528
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,970
Did you forget something at my house?

529
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,780
What?

530
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,940
Cufflinks.

531
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,630
♫ Lost to you ♫

532
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,300
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

533
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,620
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

534
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:07,760
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

535
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,250
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

536
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,210
There's nothing else you need me to do, right?

537
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,260
Thank you.

538
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,250
I can do it myself.

539
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,300
Did you forget something at my house?

540
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,280
What?

541
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,320
Cufflinks.

542
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,310
You left them on purpose?

543
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,080
It's not like I can use them.

544
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,380
If there's nothing else, we'll part ways here.

545
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,500
I can give you a ride back.

546
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,590
It's okay. I want to go back to the office first.

547
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,880
It's on the way.

548
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,160
I want to eat something before I get back. I'm hungry.

549
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,870
I'll get going then.

550
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,180
You guys get back to what you were doing.

551
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,550
Keep in touch.

552
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,930
Goodbye, Mr. He.

553
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,170
♫ Still no regrets ♫

554
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,530
♫ Meeting just to separate ♫

555
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,920
♫ Embracing just to let go ♫

556
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,220
♫ Smiling can cancel out a little sadness ♫

557
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,330
♫ I disappeared in the sea I cannot return to ♫

558
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,590
Mr. He?

559
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:06,130
♫ I can bravely love ♫

560
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:12,260
♫ And I dare to turn around and forget ♫

561
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:18,050
♫ Only if the heart dies can I start over ♫

562
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,660
He Tianxing and the others have sent someone to investigate the gallery.

563
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:29,230
But the person-in-charge says he's never even heard of the name Hu Chaoqin.

564
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,940
The person-in-charge doesn’t know Uncle Hu?

565
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,780
Has Tianjian...

566
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,020
contacted you?

567
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,760
Contacted? What do you mean contacted?

568
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,740
If you had put in even one good word for Tianjian at the police station,

569
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,480
would I have to go this long without seeing my son?

570
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,220
I told you that if Tianjian contacts you—

571
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,350
You definitely cannot cover up for him again.

572
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,380
I know.

573
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,050
Miss, please rest early.

574
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,970
Tianjian.

575
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,960
Tianjian.

576
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,240
Tianjian.

577
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,510
Tianjian.

578
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,870
Mom, over here.

579
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,630
Tianjian.

580
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,810
Food.

581
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,050
How did you end up like this?

582
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,420
Why didn't you find a better place to hide?

583
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:25,070
If I weren’t a wanted criminal, I wouldn’t be in this hellhole.

584
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,190
My credit card is frozen.

585
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:31,030
I can’t even stay at a decent hotel since I’m being monitored.

586
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,130
Oh, right. How’s your progress on asking about going overseas?

587
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,840
I want to go to Europe. Europe!

588
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,970
Okay, I'm looking.

589
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,590
I'm not very familiar with this.

590
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:52,570
Also, Mingli is keeping a very close eye.

591
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,920
He Mingli. It’s He Mingli again! That traitor!

592
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,240
She actually teamed up with He Tianxing!

593
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,120
Mom, let me tell you! Starting today, she's no longer my sister.

594
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,810
You think I really want to be your sister?

595
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,060
So what if I team up with He Tianxing?

596
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,510
Don’t forget, who was the one who locked me up in a mental hospital?

597
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,950
Don't worry.

598
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:29,100
Even if Mom were to sell Dad out, she would never sell you out.

599
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,980
Then what do you want to do?

600
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,240
I want you to go to the police station yourself.

601
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,790
What do you mean by that?

602
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:46,600
Everyone should be responsible for his own actions.

603
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,040
The best choice for Tianjian now is to take the initiative and turn himself in.

604
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,910
That’s not possible. I don’t want to go to jail.

605
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,960
I don't want to go to jail!

606
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,980
Tianjian!

607
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,950
Tianjian, are you okay?

608
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,710
It’s all your fault! Who do you think you are?

609
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,630
You hit him so hard!

610
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,120
Can’t you even do something trivial like taking care of your own people properly?

611
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,820
The chairman is gone.

612
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,890
Do you have to wait until your only brother is gone—

613
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,930
Don’t you think you have some responsibility in Tianjian’s mishap?

614
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,220
I’m not like you. Even your own brother—

615
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,970
Mom, that's enough.

616
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:40,380
Your heart only has He Tianjian. Have I ever badmouthed you?

617
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,640
He put me in a mental hospital. Have I ever badmouthed him?

618
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,750
Is it that hard for you mother and son to wake up?

619
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,430
From the day he was wanted by the police, didn’t I say that

620
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,300
he can’t run away this time?

621
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,580
If you indulge him now,

622
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,280
he will be wanted his whole life.

623
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:05,740
He will never return to being the bold and dignified young master of the He family for the rest of his life!

624
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:10,140
Hey, whose fault is it that I can't be dignified for the rest of my life?

625
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,480
You think I wanted to face off against He Tianxing?

626
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,450
I didn't want to fight. I didn't want to create any conflicts.

627
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,010
Everyone wants to be a good person. I also want to be a good person!

628
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,430
You’re the one who’s always by my side egging me on.

629
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:28,120
That day on the rooftop, if it weren’t for you saying,

630
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,170
“Don’t forget what we did to his mother! He will definitely seek revenge,”

631
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,630
would I have pushed him off the building?

632
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,400
From the beginning to the end, you were the one fighting against him.

633
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,870
Now, I’m the one who has to take full responsibility. Then what about you?

634
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:41,410
Nothing has to do with you! You're just watching the show from the sidelines! Wow!

635
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,940
I'm so unlucky!

636
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,120
Dad looked down on me.

637
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,930
You’re coercing me all the time!

638
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,290
- I don't want to be the bad guy either!
- That's enough!

639
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,080
People like you have it in their nature to be the bad guy.

640
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,130
Everything is someone else's fault.

641
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:07,390
Everything is caused by someone else. Someone else instigated it.

642
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,990
It's my fault that Tianxing's mom died.

643
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,470
I'm the one who instigated pushing Tianxing off the building.

644
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:16,030
Hu Chaoqin influenced you to lock me up in the mental hospital and take over Tianliang.

645
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:19,590

and how indecisive my brother was,

No wonder she could never get close to you.

But today, after you told her what was in your heart,

I think she probably better understands you now.

How is it fine?

You made a decision on your own, and without giving him an explanation,

01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:12,380
the storm can truly clear up in my world.

809
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,660
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

810
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,790
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

811
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:35,190
♫ A quiet strike ♫

812
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,390
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

813
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:40,750
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

814
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,860
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

815
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:48,280
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

816
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:52,830
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

817
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:56,010
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

818
01:10:56,010 --> 01:11:01,020
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

819
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,720
♫ If I could see you again ♫

820
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:12,480
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

821
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,590
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

822
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:25,770
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

823
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:29,550
♫ If you were a painter ♫

824
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,530
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

825
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:35,840
♫ No regrets ♫

826
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,590
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
