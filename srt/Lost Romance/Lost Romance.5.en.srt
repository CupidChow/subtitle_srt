Okay. I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do.

But since Situ told you not to turn off any lights,

you must abide by his request.

107

Really. Don't let the lights in his house burn out.

We worked hard for Tianliang Group.

Now they want to lay off employees at the drop of a hat?

Have they considered the livelihood of their employees?

When the CEO was here, he never let this kind of thing happen.

Okay.

Say that the strikers are greedy and never satisfied.

They are unconditionally demanding the guarantee of three months of salary as their year-end bonuses.

We'll spend a little money and bribe one or two to become thugs.

Then we'll use them to create some news.

But doing this isn't a good idea.

Which side are you on exactly?

This isn't a matter of which side I'm on.

It's a matter of trust, okay?

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,320
Did you not understand the situation?

142

I was just promoted to chairwoman, and they started to strike.

Have you ever thought that someone must have abetted this?

144
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,030
At the very second that you finished saying that, I thought about it.

145
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,730
It doesn't have to be that someone abetted it.

146
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,400

- Even if there isn't anyone abetting them,

I have to cooperate just because they went on a strike?

148

Today, they want a salary increase.

149
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,270
Tomorrow, they'll want a childcare center in the company.

150

The day after, they'll want the company to give them coffee machines, karaoke rooms, and massage rooms.

After that, will they even ask for three ply toilet paper in the restrooms?

This is the first situation I'm faced with since I've been promoted.

Everyone is watching how I take care of it.

155
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,180
If I yield this time,

who knows whether someone from another subsidiary will blackmail me tomorrow or the day after?

157

Right now I want all of Tianliang's employees to know that

I, He Mingli, am not to be messed with.

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,180
Tianjian, why don't you go in? What are you doing?

162
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,670
Uncle Hu.

163
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,740
Uncle Hu, do you think someone is abetting this strike from behind?

164
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,200
Tianxing is still in the hospital.

165
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,480
That's true.

166
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,690
Then is there any other way to stop the strike?

167
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,070
We can't just let Sis go against the union like this.

168
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,670
[Ling Chuchu]

169
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,360
Chuchu!

170
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,360
What's going on?

171
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,530
Aoran, it's time to get off work.

172
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,580
Do you want to get dinner together?

173
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,630
I'm going home to eat today.

174
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,980
What good food is there to eat at home?

175
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,090
There's something really strange and interesting at home.

176
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,080
That's right.

177
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,000
You don't need to go on the business trip this time.

178
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,610
Why?

179
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,070
What I'm saying is why is it me and CEO going on a business trip together?

180
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,650
I also want to ask why.

181
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,060
Can I really? But I think I'm not qualified enough yet.

182
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,260
You know, I know, and the old neighbor know that you're not qualified enough.

183
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,090
Whether you're qualified enough isn't something I can decide.

184
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,210
CEO decided it.

185
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,090
I...

186
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,740
Stop talking about you and me.

187
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,020
I don't want to hear this right now.

188
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,260
If you want to be happy, go home and be happy.

189
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,040
Remember to prepare all the documents that you need.

190
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,400
Don't worry. There will be an allowance.

191
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,020
Thank you, CEO. Thank you, Director.

192
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,500
Go, go, go.

193
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,000
Why? Why? Why is it Chuchu?

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,760
She has CEO in the flesh to accompany her, and there's money for the business trip.

195
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,860
Does this world still have justice?

196
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,490
Don't talk about it anymore.

197
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,950
My heart really hurts right now.

198
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,630
Or is this really because of the cookies?

199
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,560
Is it too late for me to sign up for a baking class?

200
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,690
Then I'll go with you.

201
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,540
Are you kidding me?

202
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,370
He gets off work at 6 PM and arrives home at 6:30 PM?

203
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,960
Is there no traffic?

204
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,000
What are you planning on making?

205
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,760
Seafood Alfredo pasta and roasted chicken wings.

206
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,920
- No soup?
- Beef and radish soup.

207
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,790
Oh.

208
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,080
What do you mean "oh"?

209
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,810
If you hadn't said not to put scallions, ginger, and garlic in the fridge,

210
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,430
would I have to think this hard?

211
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,760
You're not satisfied?

212
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,470
No, you're my bread and butter.

213
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,220
Other than thanking God, you're the one I thank.

214
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,010
Oh.

215
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,960
If you would go away when I'm cooking,

216
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,970
then I'll be even thankful.

217
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,850
This temperature isn't correct. You have to turn up higher.

218
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,810
Make them more charred.

219
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,200
It's 80% cooked. That's good!

220
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,920
This isn't even cooked!

221
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,990
No, this has to be fried with the seafood later.

222
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,290
If it's completely cooked, it'll be too soft.

223
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,150
My roasted chicken...

224
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,030
You did this on purpose.

225
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,620
You came to make a mess.

226
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,160
Stepchild, stepchild, stepchild! You're simply a stepchild in the world of cooking! (Implies he is unwanted)

227
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,680
Unless you don't want to eat dinner, get out of my kitchen until I'm done cooking.

228
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,730
My roast chicken...

229
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,670
In the future, will I really have to

230
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,980
live this kind of life everyday?

231
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,560
Tonight, while you're sleeping, I definitely have to

232
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,410
eat everything in your fridge!

233
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,710
By the way, you can take tomorrow off.

234
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,200
Really? Thank you, Boss.

235
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,100
So nice? What scheme is this?

236
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,170
Boss, what are you doing tomorrow?

237
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,980
My matters aren't for you to ask about.

238
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,500
When did this appear?

239
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,650
Why does this style look so familiar?

240
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,530
Why do I have a feeling that

241
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,720
Boss's disappearance tomorrow has countless reasons to do with white lotus?

242
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,550
If I guessed right, please give me a sign!

243
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,330
Hi, Chief Strategy Officer.

244
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,960
Xiao'en.

245
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,310
Where is Boss going tomorrow?

246
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,920
A business trip.

247
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,130
Then who is he going on a business trip with?

248
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,070
That's right. It's what you think.

249
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,940
Then why don't you go with him?

250
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,860
Aoran directly told me not to go.

251
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,150
He told you that you don't need to go and so you don't go?

252
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,220
You can't give up on true love so easily.

253
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,380
You know how to fake coincidentally running into them?

254
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,730
I don't really know how.

255
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,310
Then how about calling the investors and say that the investors insist that you be there?

256
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,980
Royal Group is the investor.

257
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,200
You're really not living up to my expectations.

258
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,000
Do you not know the importance of timing?

259
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,390
Next time then.

260
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,510
The next time you see them, you'll be the third wheel.

261
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,670
Trust me.

262
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,730
No way.

263
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,050
There's someone here.

264
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,310
For your and my happiness, think about what I said.

265
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,910
I'm begging you.

266
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,660
CEO, there's a problem with today's contract. It needs to be revised immediately.

267
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,060
Chuchu is already on her way with the contract.

268
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,470
What move is this?

269
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Go back to the room.

270
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,760
Why would I go back to the room with you?

271
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,160
Just you.

272
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,480
Just me? Why?

273
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,570
Don't ask. Go in and don't come out.

274
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,620
Don't make any noise.

275
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,970
- Why?
- Don't ask why. Just do what I say.

276
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,780
A night with pouring rain. A moody man...

277
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,500
Chuchu came?

278
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,060
Are you psychic?

279
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,630
I wish. If I were, I'd perform rituals and receive red envelopes rather than be mistreated here.

280
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,200
Coming—

281
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,050
Go back to your room.

282
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,240
Promise you won't scream?

283
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,080
I'll go back to my room as long as you agree to one condition.

284
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,650
In your dreams.

285
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,910
It's fine if you don't agree.

286
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,030
I'll just scream that you're being indecent right now in front of Chuchu.

287
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,160
You wouldn't dare.

288
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,190
You've already pushed me to this point. What wouldn't I dare to do?

289
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,560
What trick are you playing?

290
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,330
I've gone too far.

291
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,900
Anyway, if you agree to one condition, then I'll go to my room immediately.

292
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,400
Otherwise...

293
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,300
Help—

294
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,800
What condition?

295
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,240
You won't yell, right?

296
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,050
From this day forward, I want to eat at the dining table too.

297
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,040
If you have a portion to eat, then so do I.

298
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,020
That's it?

299
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,720
What else would it be?

300
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,330
Then you should've said it earlier.

301
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,970
You said "in your dreams" before I could say anything.

302
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,150
Hurry. Will you agree?

303
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,440
Otherwise, Chuchu will be crying outside soon.

304
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,010
Boss, my lowly self will retreat now.

305
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,010
It seems like I'm in an embarrassing situation every time I meet you.

306
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,070
I'll go get a towel for you.

307
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,010
When did you get here?

308
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,540
Don't mind that.

309
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,470
Hurry. Chuchu is about to catch a cold.

310
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,890
Don't try the soaked clothes move in front of my overbearing CEO.

311
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,490
Thank you.

312
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,970
The revised parts have been marked.

313
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,640
Please sign after you've confirmed the revisions.

314
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,310
The directors are in a hurry to send it back.

315
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,970
Do you want to take a hot shower?

316
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,700
Want me to go live outside and give you two some space?

317
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,390
What are you saying?

318
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,150
Is something wrong?

319
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,460
It's nothing.

320
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,270
Bring these things to the guest room for her.

321
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,640
I'm not that kind of person.

322
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,760
What are you thinking?

323
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,970
Should Chuchu change her clothes in the living room then?

324
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,800
Go to your room.

325
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,180
Why?

326
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,870
Go see if there are any clothes you can lend Chuchu.

327
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,930
Okay. I'll lend you a lace see-through nightgown.

328
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,060
She's such a dumb, innocent, and sweet girl that she definitely won't wonder why you have women's clothes in your house.

329
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,290
Find a way.

330
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,740
I'm only letting you come to my room because it's a critical moment.

331
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,260
Hurry and find some clothes.

332
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,950
Got it.

333
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,850
[Vitamin B with added zinc]

334
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,930
So he takes vitamin B.

335
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,320
No wonder he's full of energy from morning till night.

336
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,470
His mental and physical strength are both very strong.

337
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,390
[Vitamin B with added zinc]

338
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,430
There's even added zinc in this!

339
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,770
The female protagonist is already here.

340
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,470
How can we have this at home?

341
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,790
If you eat this which has added zinc, wouldn't...

342
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,970
No, no, no!

343
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,960
CEO.

344
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,040
A white dress shirt definitely won't do!

345
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,020
CEO.

346
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,300
Why, why, why?

347
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,310
Why do I have to help the CEO get the girl?

348
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,230
Do I look like such a good person?

349
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,870
Do you have camel leggings?

350
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,280
What's that?

351
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,480
The pants that old grandpas wear in the winter.

352
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,970
My wardrobe is not allowed to have such tasteless things.

353
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,490
What?

354
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,210
Make ginger soup.

355
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,090
Not possible. You're the one who said that I couldn't put scallions, ginger, or garlic in the fridge.

356
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,200
If you want the ginger soup to be done by the time Chuchu is out of the shower, then don't try to help.

357
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,280
CEO.

358
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,980
I'm here.

359
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,480
You ingrate!

360
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,200
If I had been standing in front of the fridge, he would have shoved me in there.

361
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,230
These clothes...

362
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,570
Is it weird?

363
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,320
Not at all.

364
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,330
Drink some hot soup first.

365
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,250
I didn't know you could cook ginger soup.

366
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,700
You're so amazing.

367
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,610
Thank you.

368
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
I contacted Susan just now.

369
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,620
I know roughly which parts of the contract need to be revised.

370
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,930
Drink the soup first while we wait for your clothes to be washed.

371
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,950
♫ Lost to you ♫

372
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:25,060
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

373
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,180

374

375
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:37,580
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

376
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:44,070
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

377
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,910
Thank you.

378
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,500
I contacted Susan just now.

379
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,960
I know roughly which parts of the contract need to be revised.

380
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,190
Drink the soup first while we wait for your clothes to be washed.

381
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,020
You have a pet cat?

382
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,180
Uh... I don't.

383
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,980
It's probably the neighbor's.

384
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,830
Is it going well?

385
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,430
The weather changes so fast. It would be bad to catch a cold.

386
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,580
- Do you also want to drink a bowl of the ginger soup?
- No, I'm okay.

387
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,820
I will get you a bowl.

388
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,810
In just one second, there are thousands of romantic lines going back and forth between the protagonists.

389
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,150
Can you wash faster?

390
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm in a rush to send someone off.

391
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,900
Tianjian, what's wrong?

392
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,650
I'm thinking about how to end the strike.

393
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,190
Uncle Hu, is there really no other way?

394
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,660
It isn't that there's no solution. It's just that...

395
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,380
Just?

396
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm afraid the current chairwoman would be unhappy.

397
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,140
Please! When is my sister ever happy?

398
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,050
Uncle Hu, please speak.

399
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,210
If there is any issue, I'll take responsibility.

400
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,810
My sister won't be mad at me.

401
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:03,390
I can understand why your sister is taking quick action to get results.

402
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,790
But if she charges forward too quickly,

403
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,240
it'll inevitably cause people to rise up.

404
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,410
What everyone needs right now is someone who is willing to listen to them and accept their opinions.

405
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,470
Someone who is inclusive and will act as a bridge between the company and its employees.

406
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,770
Previously, this role was done well by Tianxing.

407
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,030
Unfortunately, now he...

408
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,500
Not just anyone can be this bridge.

409
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,420
Me? That's impossible.

410
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,450
Look at how nervous you are.

411
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,390
I'm not trying to scare you. I'm encouraging you.

412
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,940
All three of you are the old chairman's children.

413
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,440
You can't be that bad.

414
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,650
You can do it.

415
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,990
Uncle Hu, this joke is a bit too much.

416
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,970
It's not possible for me.

417
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,820
Mingli! Come here, Mingli.

418
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,630
Help me see if this is missing something.

419
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,880
This kind of thing should be done by a flower arranger.

420
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,800
No matter how much effort you put in,

421
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,740
it won't look as good as one done by a flower arranger.

422
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,930
How bored are you?

423
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,760
I'm doing this because I'm bored.

424
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,740
Never mind.

425
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,180
Where's Tianjian?

426
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,750
Who knows where he went?

427
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,730
There's no hope for him.

428
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,380
I heard there's a strike at the company.

429
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,100
Is it serious?

430
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,050
I'm handling it.

431
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,050
You should just focus on your flowers.

432
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,720
In the past, your dad was also troubled by those union leaders.

433
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,200
I know.

434
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,610
What's the point of just knowing?

435
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,950
You need to take care of it.

436
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,290
After all, the company will be Tianjian's in the future.

437
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,010
If you wreck it, what will happen to Tianjian?

438
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,940
What did you just say?

439
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,160
Tianjian. Aren't you clearing a path in the company for him?

440
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,420
Who said I am clearing a path for him?

441
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,040
If you aren't helping him, would you be helping Tianxing then?

442
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,100
Now that Tianxing is hurt,

443
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,560
Tianjian is the only son of the He family.

444
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,760
If not him, who else could be the future owner of Tianliang Group?

445
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,990
Is there someone else who is after the position too?

446
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:40,560
As his older sister, you need to do a good job of keeping the position of chairman for Tianjian.

447
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:47,430
Well I'm sorry for being the older sister.

448
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,120
Mingli! Mingli!

449
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,380
Her temper just keeps getting worse.

450
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,230
[Contracting Party]

451
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,160
CEO, thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

452
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,890
It's fine.

453
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,730
I'll send a message to the marketing director first and tell her I'm heading over now.

454
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,620
I'll give you a ride back.

455
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,490
Say no. Say no.

456
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:26,300
If you are a woman with resolve, say no!

457
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,490
That will be too much of a bother. I can go by myself.

458
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,330
It's better if I give you a ride.

459
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,570
A rainy day. A secluded space for two.

460
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,050
It's too dangerous!

461
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,520
In order to make the leads spend a night together,

462
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,060
a windshield wiper can magically disappear from a secure house like this.

463
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,000
Guess we can only call a cab now.

464
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,410
They said it's too far.

465
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,080
Since it's a typhoon day, no one wants to go out.

466
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,890
Maybe I should just walk back?

467
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,810
How can I let you?

468
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,820
Just stay here tonight.

469
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,210
No, I can't do that. The marketing director said this is urgent.

470
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,000
If I say it's fine, then it's fine.

471
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,190
I can deal with the matters of the contract.

472
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,350
My Supreme Master is finally here.

473
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,390
Qingfeng?

474
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,760
Susan said the documents are needed as soon as possible, so I came to help Chuchu go back.

475
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,150
You are being pretty enthusiastic.

476
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,000
Of course, it's company business.

477
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,720
Let's go.

478
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,280
Then, CEO, I'll head out now.

479
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,490
It's a rainy day, so drive cautiously.

480
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,030
Don't worry, I'll definitely get Chuchu back safely.

481
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,970
Let's go.

482
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:02,440
So it seems like the female lead came to enact the romantic scenario of an extended power outage.

483
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,820
That's too dangerous. Thank goodness I successfully intercepted it.

484
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,190
Boss.

485
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,690
Boss, are you okay?

486
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,020
Go find out what's going on.

487
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,000
I think maybe the circuit breaker tripped.

488
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,060
I was just going to say that you got lucky.

489
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,010
I'm not just a cute housekeeper; I'm also a sweetheart electrician.

490
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,580
As long as I'm here, everything can be fixed quickly.

491
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:39,010
♫ Let me accompany you in insomnia ♫

492
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,160
♫ However many wishes ♫

493
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,550
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

494
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:51,610
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

495
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:58,120
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

496
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,090
Boss.

497
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,550
Boss, are you okay?

498
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,960
Go find out what's going on.

499
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,870
I think maybe the circuit breaker tripped.

500
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,980
I was just going to say that you got lucky.

501
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,890
I'm not just a cute housekeeper; I'm also a sweetheart electrician.

502
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,530
As long as I'm here, everything can be fixed quickly.

503
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,330
What?

504
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,550
I'm afraid you are just bluffing and don't have actual skills.

505
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,560
I'll go with you.

506
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,000
To supervise you.

507
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,270
There's one good news and one bad news. Which do you want to hear first?

508
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,690
- The good one.
- The circuit breaker is fine.

509
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,990
- The bad news?
- The power is out.

510
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,490
It's okay. We're going to sleep soon anyway.

511
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,020
I'll help you light a candle.

512
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,700
No way!

513
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,720
Why are you mad?

514
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,390
I'm not mad.

515
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,850
Male leads of romance novels all have childhood traumas.

516
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,930
Did something happen to you when you were little?

517
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,310
Were you kidnapped? Abused?

518
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,030
Forgotten by your friends while playing hide-and-seek?

519
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,920
Or are you like Hyun Bin who got trapped in an elevator during a fire? (Reference to the Korean drama Secret Garden)

520
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,670
Shut up!

521
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,620
I'm just asking out of concern.

522
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,830
I don't need your concern.

523
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,100
Okay, okay, I won't care.

524
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,890
There's nothing else to do, right?

525
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,880
No.

526
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,290
Then I'll go about my own business.

527
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,740
What business do you have?

528
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,690
I'm hungry.

529
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,230
What are you making?

530
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,240
Popcorn chicken.

531
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,630
I've never had it.

532
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,970
You haven't eaten a lot of things.

533
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,020
This is ugly.

534
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,290
I'm the one eating it anyway.

535
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,030
Why do I feel like you're living better than I am?

536
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,460
- How come you're not going to sleep?
- It's none of your business when I go to sleep.

537
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,960
It's this taste!

538
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,150
I'll get some ice.

539
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,770
I knew it!

540
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,990
So petty. It's nothing special.

541
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,530
Didn't you say that it's nothing special?

542
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,180
I'm just afraid that you won't be able to finish it.

543
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,260
Let me tell you. While popcorn chicken tastes good, it's also very poisonous.

544
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,590
How poisonous could it be?

545
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:05,070
It'll make you gain weight, grow acne, have cardiovascular disease, and have poor metabolism.

546
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,770
If that's true, then why are you eating it?

547
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,810
Can't I want to commit suicide?

548
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,450
Then I'll eat another piece

549
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,620
so that you won't be lonely on the path to death.

550
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,970
You're full?

551
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,770
My turn.

552
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,840
Didn't you forbid me from peeking?

553
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,870
Now you're personally inviting me to take a good look.

554
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,330
Zheng Xiao'en.

555
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,960
What?

556
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,760
Don't peek.

557
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,340
I know.

558
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,930
If you peek, I'll be angry.

559
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,030
I know!

560
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,760
No matter how much you want to look, hold it in!

561
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,970
I could leave right now!

562
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,450
He forces me to watch a food eating show that I don't want to watch,

563
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,110
but he won't let me watch the CEO shower show that I want to watch.

564
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,000
He's too much.

565
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,700
It's dark.

566
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,960
It's slanted.

567
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,400
I'm tired!

568
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,570
The labor law stipulates that one should only work eight hours a day.

569
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,420
Can you count how many hours have passed by since the power went out?

570
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,320
Go to sleep!

571
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,040
Sleep!

572
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,680
Zheng Xiao'en.

573
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,010
What?

574
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,920
Nothing.

575
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,310
Xiao'en.

576
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:52,670
What?

577
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,340
Nothing.

578
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,500
Hey.

579
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,990
Hey.

580
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,990
Are you having trouble sleeping?

581
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,790
If so, I can tell you a story. Okay?

582
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,990
Once upon a time, there was a wicked boss

583
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,980
who wouldn't let his housekeeper sleep

584
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,150
on a stormy night when the power was out.

585
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,760
- The housekeeper is really—
- I think this story is a bit strange.

586
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,410
Tell a different story.

587
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,470
Am I a little bunny story machine?

588
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:50,590
Once upon a time, in a faraway castle, there lived a girl called Cinderella.

589
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,260
She wore glass slippers and met a prince.

590
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,240
From then on, they lived happily ever after.

591
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,740
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

592
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,460
Fine. Then I'll tell a more suspenseful one.

593
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:07,690
Once upon a time, a detective got on a train.

594
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,410
Then an antique dealer also got on the train.

595
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,180
Then a princess, a secretary, a doctor, a housekeeper, a dancer,

596
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,210
and a whole bunch of people all got on the train.

597
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,470
Suddenly, the antique dealer died.

598
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,030
Then they searched and searched.

599
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,640
Searched and searched.

600
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,220
It turns out the murderer was

601
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,380
everyone.

602
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,510
There are no other stories?

603
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,350
Boss! Please let me sleep.

604
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,910
I'll lose my voice if I keep speaking.

605
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,390
Zheng Xiao'en.

606
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,250
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

607
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,010
You won't let me eat or sleep.

608
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,240
You really don't have a conscience! There are human rights when it comes to punishment too!

609
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,860
I'm begging you!

610
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,030
If you need anything, let's talk about it tomorrow, okay?

611
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,320
Then, you'll stay here, right?

612
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,580
You're not allowed to sneak away when I'm asleep.

613
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,450
If I catch you sneaking away,

614
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:49,300
I'm canceling our agreement today to eat at the dining table together.

615

♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

You won't let me eat or sleep.

I'm canceling our agreement today to eat at the dining table together.

627
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:28,030
Don't worry, I'll sleep here.

628
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,530
I promise I won't go anywhere.

629
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,890
Even if I sleepwalk, I won't leave.

630
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:43,940

00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,410
♫ There will be no more parting ♫

645
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,010
♫ Tonight I'm here ♫

646
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,270
My spine.

647
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,440
He actually let me sleep like this for the whole night?

648
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,950
The bed is huge, yet he wouldn't split it with me.

649
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,590
No wonder he asked me to come to his house to fix his toilet.

650
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,360
It was so that I could smoothly flush away the capitalist's conscience.

651
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,830
Sorry, the capitalist has no conscience.

652
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,590
Good morning, Boss!

653
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,720
What a beautiful day it is today!

654
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,440
- Breakfast?
- Yes! What do you want to eat, Boss?

655
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,770
We have both Chinese-style and Western-style food.

656
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:10,660
- Toast and baked flatbread.
- I want something with a conscience.

657
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,470
Yes! A feast with a conscience is coming right up!

658
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,570
This is called, "You are what you eat."

659
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,520
If you don't have a conscience, supplement a conscience into your diet.

660
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,920
How rare it is for you to be so self-aware.

661
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,460
Did I use a blanket last night?

662
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,430
That's impossible.

663
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,960
Most likely, it went something like this.

664
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,710
What are these?

665
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,550
Carbohydrates, minerals,

666
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,670
protein, fat, and vitamins.

667
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:53,500
The five essential nutrients are all here.

668
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,800
What's wrong?

669
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:47,130
Don't think you can use an affectionate gaze to steal my melon.

670
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,950
♫ Lost to you ♫

671
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:15,310
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

672
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:18,700
♫ My last wish is to never regret ♫

673
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:24,710
♫ Brave out the heartbreak to no longer be afraid of heartbreaks ♫

674
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:31,340
♫ I choose to bid farewell with a smile ♫

675
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,930
Don't think you can use an affectionate gaze to steal my melon.

676
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,670
All the food on the table is mine.

677
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,660
You...

678
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,530
- Immature.
- Thank you.

679
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,030
Immature.

680
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,630
If you're not going to eat it, give it to me.

681
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,720
He's definitely going to see the white lotus in full bloom.

682
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,100
He's smiling so happily.

683
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:05,820
The contract is in triplicate. Don't forget to remind the client to stamp over the margins. Got it?

684
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,800
I wrote all of it down. Please rest assured, Director.

685
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,060
Hello, CEO.

686
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,720
Yes, yes.

687
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,630
Okay, I will head out now.

688
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,740
Sorry, the CEO is here.

689
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,940
I'm leaving now.

690
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,850
Did you hear what she just said?

691
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:35,620
"CEO, you came to pick me up. You're so considerate!"

692
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,610
I'm so jealous.

693
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:39,790
You're not allowed to be jealous.

694
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,760
Jealousy is defeat, got it?

695
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,830
That's right. Jealousy is defeat.

696
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,980
- We won't be jealous.
- We won't be jealous.

697
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:52,300
We absolutely won't be jealous.

698
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,460
Are you singing a new song?

699
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,820
How have you been after leaving the company?

700
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,530
Did you find a new job?

701
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,420
Yes, we've been really worried about you.

702
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,720
I do... have a job.

703
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,190
What kind of job?

704
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,030
How do you have time to visit us on a workday?

705
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,770
It's... It's being a nanny.

706
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,750
A nanny?

707
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,340
The kid was brought to his grandma's house deep in the mountains, so I'm off today.

708
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:32,500
A nanny? That's so tragic.

709
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,960
He poops and pees?

710
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,390
He's a giant baby with a really bad temper.

711
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,600
There's so much poop and pee.

712
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,180
I have to coax him to sleep in the middle of the night.

713
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,950
Once he wakes up, he makes a fuss wanting to eat.

714
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,700
If he doesn't get his way, he starts whining.

715
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,560
The working hours are long enough,

716
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,610
and you have to deal with emotional blackmail?

717
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:56,090
Such a hardworking employee as yourself has fallen to such depths.

718
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,430
Compared to that queen of mistakes,

719
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:00,980
life really isn't fair.

720
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:08,470
Why... Why isn't she here?

721
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,750
Don't even mention it.

722
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,440
She's risen to heaven.

723
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,130
This time, the CEO is going to one of the top ten hot spring resorts

724
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,410
as voted by tourists all over the world.

725
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:37,900
Tourism magazines describe it as a beautiful hot spring fit for the residence of immortals.

726
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,910
- Hello, CEO. Please come in.
- Thank you.

727
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,590
Also, the landscape there is incredibly therapeutic.

728
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,770
Walking around feels like you're floating in the clouds.

729
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,360
Heaven. It's heaven.

730
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,350
Also, the chef's tasting menu there has

731
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:03,110
the great flavors that so many food critics keep hidden.

732
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:05,470
They design their menus around the seasonal changes.

733
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,030
I hear every dish is a surprise.

734
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,320
If the company doesn't foot the bill,

735
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,230
how would low-income people like us ever stay at such a high-end place?

736
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,680
It's fine, it's fine. They went there to work.

737
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,280
Upsetting, upsetting, totally upsetting.

738
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,320
Just talking about this makes me mad.

739
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,100
The CEO's itinerary today is to inspect and approve all of the resort's

740
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,250
daytime and nighttime facilities and service plans.

741
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,860
He wants to see if they made any improvements based on his previous suggestions.

742
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:42,910
If he's satisfied, we will begin contract negotiations tomorrow.

743
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:48,200
So their scheduled itinerary is to feel refreshed from morning till night.

744
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,270
It's 3 PM now.

745
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,680
They must be having their afternoon tea.

746
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,820
Say that again.

747
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,150
What is that idiotic younger brother of mine doing?

748
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:14,460
The CHRO is at the office entrance distributing meals to the employees who are on strike.

749
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,850
Also...

750
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,650
Also what? Hurry up and say it.

751
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,030
Also, the CHRO told them that

752
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:24,190
he'll take responsibility and talk it out with you.

753
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:26,350
He said he'll definitely give them an explanation.

754
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,790
Hurry up and call him.

755
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,480
[Young Master Tianjian]
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

756
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,080
Charges will apply after the tone. If you are not leaving a message, please hang up.

757
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,970
To leave a quick message, after the tone please press⁠—

758
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:49,040
Right now, one person has to do the work of three people.

759
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,790
We're working at least twelve hours a day.

760
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,200
- I can't take it anymore.
- Press on. You've worked hard.

761
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,260
Doesn't the company have a provision that if you work overtime, you can apply for compensatory leave?

762
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,370
How can we take any leave?

763
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:03,160
Let's not even talk about the fact that we have three times more work than before.

764
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,510
The company laid off so many senior employees without providing any time for the handover.

765
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:11,790
Sometimes, we're afraid to not work on Saturdays and Sundays.

766
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,050
That's not okay. Your body can't take it.

767
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:18,750
That's right! A lot of my colleagues have collapsed.

768
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,930
Okay, everyone, stay calm.

769
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:25,590
Tianxing once said that the employees are the company's most valuable asset.

770
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,870
I completely agree with this statement.

771
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:31,130
I fully understand everyone's request. I will pass the word on to the chairwoman.

772
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,160
We absolutely won't treat you poorly.

773
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,910
My colleagues, right now, besides the CEO,

774
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:39,240
CHRO He is also on our side!

775
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,070
I believe he will do everything he can to fight for our rights and interests!

776
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:49,040
CHRO He! CHRO He! CHRO He!

777
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,420
CHRO! CHRO!

778
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:05,230
Chairwoman, I've come to understand everyone's request.

779
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,750
It's actually very reasonable.

780
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:09,500
I will report it to you once we go back to the office.

781
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,260
There's no need.

782
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,000
Tianliang Group's treatment of its employees

783
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,770
has always been better than the industry standard.

784
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:28,390
To date, salaries have been paid on time every month.

785
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:31,130
We've never owed any of you a single cent.

786
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:35,940
The Group took care of you for so many years,

787
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,020
yet this is how you repay our company?

788
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,000
You left your work post without authorization.

789
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,570
You smeared our name and spread rumors to the outside,

790
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,690
destroying the company's image!

791
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:53,430
I know what you guys want.

792
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:57,290
Who doesn't want more money and less work?

793
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,050
I can give out gift boxes right now

794
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:04,960
and pat everyone's head in order to quickly end this farce.

795
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,810
However, as Tianliang Group's chairwoman,

796
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,800
the Group's future is on my shoulders.

797
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,790
I must correct the common practice of my employees.

798
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:21,790
All of you,

799
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:23,770
if you are willing to write a letter of repentance

800
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:26,850
and admit that striking was a mistake that you won't make again in the future,

801
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,440
please stand up and return to the office with me.

802
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,950
We will forget that anything happened today.

803
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,210
Tomorrow, everyone will continue to work hard together.

804
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,750
Wow.

805
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,880
That's so great.

806
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,170
You guys have such a backbone.

807
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,980
It's worth my applause for you.

808
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:03,390
Qiaozhi, take down all of the strikers' names.

809
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,480
All these people...

810
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:11,050
Tianliang Group doesn't want them.

811
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,930
- Let's start recruiting new people tomorrow.
- Yes.

812
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:15,330
How could this happen?

813
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:18,010
What do we do? CHRO He, what do we do?

814
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:21,470
Tonight is the turning point in the plot.

815
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,780
Even if I sleep in the streets,

816
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:28,020
I won't helplessly watch you two share a room.

817
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:30,160
Aoran!

818
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,050
Situ Aoran, wake up! Situ Aoran!

819
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:37,080
Is it because I can see him and touch him

820
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,670
that all the fear he's experienced

821
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,980
seems to have become real?

822
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,970
Whomever you want to push forward for, you will fight for her.

823
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,450
♫ Memories wear protective coloration ♫

824
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:04,560
♫ Ambushing in the middle of the night ♫

825
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,330
♫ A quiet strike ♫

826
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,250
♫ Streetlights awaiting dusk ♫

827
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,570
♫ Still awaiting as always ♫

828
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:18,680
♫ Nothing is impossible ♫

829
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:23,050
♫ Even if no one is perfect ♫

830
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:27,680
♫ Holding you next to my heartbeat ♫

831
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,890
♫ Tightly held the palm of my hand ♫

832
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:34,790
♫ It remains the only farewell ♫

833
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:40,630
♫ If I could see you again ♫

834
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:47,300
♫ Carefully planning my gamble with you ♫

835
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:51,400
♫ In the end I lost to you ♫

836
01:10:51,400 --> 01:11:00,810
♫ I think of you until I can no longer breathe ♫

837
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:04,350
♫ If you were a painter ♫

838
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,350
♫ Then I'll be your canvas ♫

839
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:10,710
♫ No regrets ♫

840
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:16,430
♫ I lost all my love to you ♫
