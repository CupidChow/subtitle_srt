00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,208
[gentle music playing]

2
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,583
[music picks up pace]

3
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,333
[indistinct chatter]

4
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,750
Oh, look!

5
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,833
Can you sit up? So crowded…

6
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,083
You make it crowded.

7
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,750
-[girl 1] Jeez, how am I--
-[woman] You both shut up, okay?

8
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,083
It feels like a magical place.

9
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,083
Where are we?

10
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,125
Okay, stop yapping.

11
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,958
[music continues]

12
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,916
[indistinct voice on car radio]

13
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,125
[woman] So much traffic!

14
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,625
So annoying.

15
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,833
[brakes squeaking]

16
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,416
-She's not listening.
-I want to help.

17
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,333
-Take this.
-Go inside, there are a lot of cars.

18
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,875
You two go inside.

19
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,541
Hurry up.

20
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,041
No standing here.

21
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,250
Slow down.

22
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,333
[gasps softly]

23
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,041
This is a lot smaller than the photo.

24
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,166
[slurping]

25
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,708
[with mouth full] This is so delicious.
Can we eat this every day?

26
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,333
Let me tell you.

27
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,458
There's a guy in Japan…

28
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,916
He ate instant noodles
every day for a year.

29
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,958
[whispers] Then he died.

30
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,916
Really?

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,250
Are you trying to give her nightmares?

32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,750
You know what happened in the end?

33
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,875
What?

34
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,625
There are so many preservatives
in the noodles,

35
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,708
so his body never decayed.

36
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,500
Nobody realized he had died.

37
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,500
[chuckles]

38
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,625
[little girl humming]

39
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,125
Eat up, I-Jing. You have school tomorrow.

40
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,500
Oh, okay.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,166
Do you still want to eat instant noodles
every day?

42
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,916
It's falling out.

43
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,833
[bicycle bell rings]

44
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,250
Everyone, we have a new classmate today.

45
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,750
Her name is Cheng I-Jing.

46
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,000
She's five years old.

47
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,416
She's in our senior class.

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,291
This is her first day,
so she is a little nervous.

49
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,500
So you have to be good friends to her.

50
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,416
[children] Okay.

51
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,750
[teacher] If she wants to go
to the restroom, what do you do?

52
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,333
Show her the way.

53
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,875
Great. Let's sit down first.

54
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,583
I-Jing, you sit here today.

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,333
[girl] And you just keep lining them up.

56
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,625
When you are done,
ask me to check them, okay?

57
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,291
This one?

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,083
Here it is.

59
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,291
This is the stand.

60
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,375
This stand is at the best location.

61
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,916
This is it!

62
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,500
This stand is at the best location.
Look at the length.

63
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,750
This one is spacious.
You have something smaller and cheaper?

64
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,666
The stainless steel sink,
fridge and freezer.

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,000
They are all good to use.

66
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,375
You can start making money
as early as this Friday.

67
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,916
If you fail to pay?

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,333
Excuse me, you will be shut down.

69
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,041
I'm so bored.

70
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,583
When will we get there?

71
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm so bored.

72
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,916
When will we get there?

73
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,083
[alarm bell ringing]

74
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,791
[I-Jing] Are we there yet?

75
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,916
[mother] We arrived. This is it.

76
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,833
[voice speaking on TV]

77
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,333
When you see grandparents,
remember to say hi. You heard me?

78
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,416
Oh, okay.

79
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,500
Do you remember Grandma? Huh?

80
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,375
You were this small when I visited.

81
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,208
You don't remember me?

82
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,125
[laughs] It's okay, no problem.

83
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,666
So cute.

84
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,333
I-Ann.

85
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,166
Your shirt and shorts are way too short.

86
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,958
There are lots of perverts and psychos
out there.

87
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,375
It's dangerous to dress like that.

88
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,250
No worries, I wear these every day.

89
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,250
I told her many times.
She wouldn't listen.

90
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,583
[grandma] And look at you…
You're looking haggard, you know?

91
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,875
Are you getting enough sleep?

92
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,541
We just paid the deposit.
We can start on Monday.

93
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,750
Why can't we run a fruit stand?

94
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,250
Isn't it easier to wash the fruits
and display them for sale?

95
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,041
Do you know that fruits are easily rotten?

96
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,041
[scoffs]

97
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,333
You have to spend twice the money and time
to prepare the food for the noodle stand.

98
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,750
Is it truly a better deal?

99
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,041
If you make money, you can have opinions.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
Okay. I will go make money myself.

101
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,958
I'll make more than you do.

102
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,958
Please, please.

103
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,541
No fighting while eating, okay?

104
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,833
She thinks she knows it all.
She didn’t even graduate high school.

105
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,791
Seriously.

106
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,791
Is that my fault?

107
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,666
This is our first family dinner.
Watch your attitude.

108
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,833
Aren't you the problem?

109
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,041
Wait a second.

110
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,666
[stutters] Why is she eating
with her left hand?

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,833
[grandma] Don't worry about it, okay?

112
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,750
Give me a break and eat your dinner.
So annoying.

113
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,166
[upbeat music playing]

114
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,333
How come you didn’t buckle up the helmet?

115
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,291
Sister, look. What is that?

116
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,625
Sis, I got a prize at school today.

117
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,916
What are you doing?

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Wait until we get home, not now!

119
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,916
-[car horn honks]
-I am telling Mom you ran the red light!

120
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,375
If you get there fast,

121
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,458
I won't call you out for farting.

122
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,833
We're almost there.

123
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,916
[upbeat music continues]

124
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,708
[music continues]

125
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,791
[hammering]

126
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,000
[oil sizzling]

127
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,083
[arcade game sounds bleeping]

128
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,333
[alarm beeping]

129
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,625
[sizzling]

130
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,666
[bicycle bell ringing]

131
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,083
[man] Whether it's water spilling,

132
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,875
or any other liquid,

133
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,916
let me tell you, its absorption is super.

134
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,958
You really don't want to try?

135
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,041
Uncle, you can use it as a diaper.

136
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,083
Inflation is out of control right now.
Only your salary didn't increase.

137
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,625
Hi, Johnny!

138
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,916
Hi.

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,208
Let me introduce my loyal customer.

140
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,625
Come, I-Jing,
let me pick you up. [exclaims]

141
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,208
Oh, getting heavy!

142
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,833
Did you eat too much?

143
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,708
Come tell everyone
how useful this Magic Sponge is.

144
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,916
It is very useful!

145
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,583
How useful?

146
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,458
It is the best sponge in the world.

147
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,250
You'll regret not buying it.

148
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,250
Did you hear that?

149
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,125
You'll regret not buying it.

150
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,333
Thanks to my special guest.

151
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,791
Hurry back to Mommy.

152
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,041
Special price today!
Buy one, get one free.

153
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,208
Mom.

154
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,625
-Did your sister pick you up on time?
-No, but she told me to say that she did.

155
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,541
[store owner] Three.

156
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,125
But I still think
you need to dress a little sexier.

157
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,250
[woman] But I thought
what I wear is very revealing.

158
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,625
[man] Six.

159
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,250
[owner] Revealing doesn't mean sexy.

160
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,083
The idea is to create a sexual fantasy
for the customer.

161
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,541
Seven.

162
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,583
Five.

163
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,333
[man] Queen.

164
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,500
[owner] Wait, let me introduce.

165
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,625
Hello.

166
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,708
I-Ann, this is Xiao-Ping.

167
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,708
Xiao-Ping, this is I-Ann.

168
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,833
-Who is this?
-I told you. Her name's Xiao-Ping.

169
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,416
Hello. I'm Xiao-Ping.

170
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,583
Why is she here?

171
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,041
I told you I'm hiring a new girl.

172
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,916
That girl Xiao-Mei with her stone face.
Ruined my business.

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,958
So I called her and fired her.

174
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,666
Not my business.

175
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,500
This is your business.
I need you to show her the ropes.

176
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,750
Mom, is this the last dish?

177
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,041
Do you need other help?

178
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,208
No, no more.

179
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,125
Okay.

180
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,458
-Go do your homework.
-Okay.

181
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,208
[I-Ann] This is betel nut.
Betel flower. Red lime.

182
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,500

Get some red lime.

Put it in the center of the betel nut.

185
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,708
Add a betel flower.

186
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,708

Ten in a box.
You have to make 300 at once.

191
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,000
Put them in the fridge immediately
to keep fresh. Got it?

192
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,875
You're so skilled.
How long have you been doing this?

193
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,208
[owner] Don't be too mean. Be nice.

194
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,625
Don't scare her.

I am very nice.

196
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,416
I explain things very clearly, okay?

197
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,166
$2,000 increase is way too much.

198
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,583
-Mom, look!

Take a cup for me.

208

-What's the matter?
-Want to ask you out to sing.

I have to teach the new girl.

Got it?

224
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,166

Don't be so polite with me.

233

No way.

Dogs are dirty.

Put it here?

361
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,875
Yes, right here.
-Oh.

362
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,666
You work at the betel nut stand.
Your mom is okay with that?

363
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,125
I don't care about her.
Anyway, I’ll end up earning more than her.

364
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,333
You don't know how to cook, stop it.

365
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,500
-Okay, you do it, whatever.
-You get out.

366
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,583
What a mess.

367
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,833
Come check it out. Multifunction brush.
There are four types of brushes.

368
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,208
You can brush the glass,
the toilet, the tiles, the cracks.

369
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,250
Solve all the problems
with just one bottle.

370
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,541
Hey, hey, hey.

371
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,833
You cheated again.

372
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,541
[mockingly] "You cheated again."

373
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,541
You cheated again. One more time.

374
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,625
[pop music playing over speakers]

375
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,583
[I-Ann] Hurry up.

376
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,750
I haven’t finished the hey, hey, hey part.
You cheated.

377
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,791
Okay, play on your own.
Do your drawings. Be good.

378
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,375
[whines]

379
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,708
-[Johnny] Are you leaving?
-I am leaving.

380
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,291
Bye-bye.

381
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,625
Hey, who did this?

382
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,375
I saw some kids
spitting the tapioca balls earlier.

383
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,416
Today's youth… Unbelievable.

384
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,666
This has gone too far!

385
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,041
I have a brush. Let me help you clean.

386
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,000
Pissing me off.

387
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,958
Don't I have enough work to do?

388
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:53,041
Let me help. Let me help.
Let me tell you, this tool is amazing.

389
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,916
I have four types of brushes.

390
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,916
You can brush glass, brush the toilet…

391
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
[monitor beeping]

392
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,833
Go sit over there first.

393
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,250
Wait here. Got it?

394
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,583
[video game chiming]

395
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,375
[ventilator pumping]

396
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,750
Can't speak?

397
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,541
That's great.

398
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,333
No apologies or explanations.

399
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,041
Save the trouble.

400
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,083
I'm not here to converse with you.

401
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,666
I just want to say one thing.

402
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,583
I told you I am not going to read it.

403
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,583
Sis, I want to use the restroom.

404
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,875
[ventilator continues pumping]

405
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,458
Are you surprised?

406
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,000
Do you think Mom
would foolishly wait for you?

407
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,375
She had already met another man
in Taitung.

408
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,500
Next time my mother comes in here,

409
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,666
I want you to tell her
not to come visit you again.

410
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,833
You heard me?

411
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,666
You heard me?

412
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,000
Sis, who's he?

413
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,291
Who's he?

414
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,750
Who's he?

415
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,416
You are so annoying!

416
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,958
Why are you being so aggressive?

417
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,750
If you dare tell Mom we came here,

418
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,125
you will be fucked.

419
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,208
I will throw out all your crayons.
You heard me?

420
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,875
What are you crying about? Answer me!

421
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,541
Okay.

422
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,958
[automatic doors open]

423
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,583
[phone ringing]

424
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
[phone continues ringing]

425
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,250
[grunts]

426
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,958
[door creaks open]

427
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,208
[voice speaking faintly on TV]

428
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:12,000
This Friday and Saturday,
I have to go to Yilan for some errands.

429
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,250
Go help Ali open the stand earlier.

430
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,583
Then take I-Jing to Grandma's.
Let her stay overnight.

431
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:22,916
What errands?

432
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,375
He's dying,
what can you be helping him with?

433
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,916
Why are you so opinionated?

434
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,250
You already paid for his debt
more than ten years.

435
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,833
What else do you owe him?

436
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,833
What else do you owe him?

437
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,250
He is dead.

438
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:41,500
Once I take care of his funeral,
I’ll be done paying. Are you happy now?

439
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,791
[door slams]

440
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,375
[Ali] The noodle is ready.
Bring it to the customer for me.

441
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,625
[I-Ann] All right, I am working, okay?

442
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,291
Here are your noodles.

443
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,541
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

444
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,500
[Ali] There is a customer, take the order.

445
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,333
I want dried noodles, small.
And blanched vegetables.

446
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:12,458
-Dried noodles--
-Help me wash the dirty dishes.

447
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,458
Small meat meatball soup.

448
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,375
[Ali] Okay.

449
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,166
[water running, dishes clattering]

450
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,458
It will be ready soon.

451
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:26,791
Okay. Thanks.

452
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,541
[woman] Squid ball!

453
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,333
-Okay, I will have roasted corn.
-Okay.

454
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,125
[woman] Cheng I-Ann?

455
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,208
It's me, Xie Mu-Xi.

456
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,375
Long time no see.

457
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,833
You look different.

458
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,583
[I-Ann] Xie Mu-Xi?

459
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,791
We were in the same class
in Taipei High School.

460
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:51,666
I changed my name. It was Xie Xin-Yi.
My mom took me to a fortune-teller.

461
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,458
He suggested changing my name
to get a better shot on the college exam.

462
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:55,375
For real?

463
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,916
[Xie] More than half of our classmates
changed their names.

464
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,125
-[I-Ann] For real?
-Mm.

465
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,333
[I-Ann] I had no idea.

466
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,541
I didn't know you were in Taipei.

467
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,833
Yeah, I moved back here recently.

468
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,208
Which university do you go to?

469
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,916
I am not in university.

470
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,250
Do you work here?

471
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:16,833
No, this is my mom's noodle stand.
I come here to help once in a while.

472
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,125
We are throwing a motel party next week.

473
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,000
Pin-Rui is super impressive.
He booked the biggest suite.

474
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,916
Please come. We haven’t seen each other
for so long. It will be fun!

475
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,375
Motel party?

476
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,750
Hurry, get off.

477
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,666
I don't want to go to Grandma's place.

478
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,208
Grandpa never takes showers.

479
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,708
He smells like stinky tofu!

480
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,708
You are the stinky one.
Stop complaining. Go inside.

481
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,458
Listen to Grandpa and Grandma.

482
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,125
Okay.

483
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,208
[moped speeds off]

484
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,291
[man speaking indistinctly on TV]

485
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,250
[grandpa] Eating with her left hand?

486
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,958
Shu-Fen doesn't know how to raise a kid?

487
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,750
Give me a break.

488
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,125
Times have changed.

489
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,041
-Nobody cares about this anymore.
-It makes me angry to see that!

490
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,291
If it were in the old days…

491
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,958
If you insist on using your left hand,
you'll be hung up and beaten.

492
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,000
[pop music playing over speakers]

493
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,958
-You have a U.S. visa?
-Yes.

494
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,000
Let me see.

495
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,875
What are you looking at?

496
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,291
Children should listen and not talk.

497
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,333
Be good, watch them dance.

498
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,500
They are bad.

499
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,583
Be good.

500
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,708
[man] She’s arriving tomorrow night.

501
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:35,583
Your flight is early Sunday morning.
She’ll have to sleep over at your place.

502
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,666
-Is that okay?
-Okay, no problem.

503
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,875
You need to be careful
when passing the customs.

504
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:40,833
Hey!

505
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,250
Don't touch this.
This is worth a lot of money.

506
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,166
[man] Fuck. This is why I don't want kids.

507

I have to go open the noodle stand
for my mom.

Why didn't you tell me?

524

Come in quickly.

530
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,875
Why so nervous?

531
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:18,416
You don’t understand.
We have a nosy neighbor.

-She's all yours.
-I will take care of her, no worries.

to a national university.

710
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,833
You were a straight-A student.
Also, the campus belle.

711
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,041
Everyone was super jealous of you.

712
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,875
Campus belle is an embarrassing title.

713
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
[indistinct chatter from the kitchen]

714
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,833
[Shu-Fen] I-Jing,
did you brush your teeth?

715
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:28,000
Not yet.

716
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:31,333
I never thought I'd see you again.

717
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,125
You just disappeared one day.

719

We moved after my father ran away.

720
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,291
I thought your father left
long before that.

721
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,291
[girl] Yeah! Let's open the champagne!

722
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,750

Thank you.

Where is the cap?

727
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:05,375
It's okay.
We are going to finish it anyway.

[glasses clink]

730
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:13,583
Smile more. You usually seem a bit gloomy.

731
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,916
You seem distracted at work.

732
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,500
I think when you smile

733
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,375
you look really nice.

734
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,625
[chuckles]

735
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,416
What is it?

736
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:29,583
Drink. What's wrong?

737
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,875
Nothing. [laughing]

738
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:34,208

So how much?

743

What are you talking about?

744
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,916
[student 1] Two for 200.
100 for a thigh touch. [laughs]

745
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,375
Two for 200.

746
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,625
I work hard.
You have no right to criticize others!

747

Let me help you.

757
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,708

What?

-Quiet down. That’s not true.

-No. Come back first!

Okay, thanks. See you. Bye-bye.

Play ball with me?

[I-Jing] But I want to bring GooGoo…

794
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,083
[grandma] Here,
I brought gifts for everyone.

00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:08,666
-Everyone has one. One bag per person.
-Mom, thanks.

796

There is no fish oil?

799
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,375
So we got t-shirts?

800
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:25,291
These vitamins are the best!

801

Besides, it has the highest potency!
They are very expensive.

[sister 1] How often do you travel
to America?

803

[grandma] No. I go about twice a month.

804
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,000
Twice? Twice is a lot.

805
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,750
Ah! No big deal.
Let me go to the restroom.

-How much is it per table?
-Let me clarify first.

-Will our brother share the bill with us?
-[sister 1] It's not a lot of money.

He died? When?

814
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,458
What? Does he have no family anymore?

815
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,875
It's not your responsibility
to pay for the funeral.

816
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,666
-Who is he to you?
-I'm his only family.

I still had to pay.

He lent money to your husband when needed.

Don’t bring up what happened
a million years ago.

-I paid it back, okay?
-These are two separate matters.

825
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,375
[Shu-Fen] Like I said,
if I didn't pay for him, no one would pay.

826
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:49,958
It's not about you pay it back or not.

827
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,541
-He helped you.
-[sister 1] These are 2 separate matters.

828
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,166
-She paid the money back.
-I worked hard.

829
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,958
He passed away. I paid for his funeral.
Not on just… not for luxury spending.

830
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,666
Shouldn't you assess your situation first?

831
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,375
-[Shu-Fen] It's for his funeral.
-[sister 1] You never discuss with us.

832
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,458
-I don't get it.
-[sister 2] You act first, inform us later.

-[Shu-Fen] Weird, this is my life.

You should think about this.
You're always like this.

00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,125
What’s wrong now?

840
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,291
I was only away for two minutes.

anything good. Let's hear it. What is it?

It’s either being late or leaving early.
You talk to Xiao-Ping yourself.

854
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:09,291
So she can make her own schedule now?

855
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,208
You do it for me.

that day? You got drunk in the end?

You fell asleep later.

Do you remember anything
before you fell asleep?

871
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:14,125
I was drunk that day too.

872
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,583

if there's a chance,

874

What?

883
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,333
What are you doing?

884
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,875
Nothing. Just browsing.

885
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:54,125
-Let's go have some shaved ice!
-Okay.

GooGoo, don't bother me.

894
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,625
I'm drawing right now.

895
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,958
This will be the last throw.

905
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,291
<i>When the motorcycle passed here,</i>

906
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:19,083
<i>it seems like a meerkat fell from the sky.</i>

907
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,416
<i>The motorcyclist was so startled</i>

908
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,583

912

<i>Then he slammed on the brakes.</i>

913
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,666
<i>Then he charged toward that direction.</i>
<i>And then he fell down.</i>

914
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,125
<i>And he started bleeding.</i>

915
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,833

[reporter] <i>We can take a look</i>

926
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:03,000

Okay, enough.

929
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,750
Why does it keep replaying?
It's so annoying.

930
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:12,208
Can I go see it?

931
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:15,541
No. The landlord knows we have a pet,
we might get kicked out.

932
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,958
Why did it have to jump down
with the ball?

933
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:22,166
Not your fault.

934
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:24,791
I know it's not my fault.

935
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:27,416
That's the Devil's fault.

936
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,083
It's okay. Don't worry, okay?

937

-Don't be sad.

Hey.

You?

941
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,041
Come outside with me.

942
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,375
What the fuck!

943
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:55,916
-Vixen! Think you can sleep with husbands?
-You fucking psycho, who are you?

944
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,750
-What is it?
-You don't get it?

945
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,500
This is my husband’s stand!

946
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,458
[I-Ann] What? Who are you?

947
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:06,000
-You slept with my husband, got it?
-Didn't you say you're divorced?

948
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,250
I've never said that.

949
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,041
You told me you're divorced!

950
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,250
Fuck you! Don’t touch my husband!

951
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,958
What the fuck is your problem?
You crazy bitch!

952
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,708
-How dare you hit me?
-[A-Ming] Wait!

953
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:17,958
-Don't run away!
-[A-Ming] Calm down!

954
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:20,125
-Cheng I-Ann, come back here!
-This is embarrassing!

955
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,333
Don't pull me!

956
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,750
I am out! I fucking quit!

957
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,291
[A-Ming] Hey, you cannot quit.
Who's going to take care of my shop?

958
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:29,625
Run as far as you can, please!
Don’t let me see you again!

959
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:30,875
You should die!

Forgot to tell you, he never wore a condom
and he came inside me.

-[customer] Thank you.
-Come again.

968
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:30,833
Take a look.

-Johnny.
-Yeah.

970
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:35,625
Don't I often promote
your products for you?

971
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,625
-Yes.
-You should pay me for the advertising.

972
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,041
Oh. You're charging me
for advertising fees?

973
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,333
Is it enough?

974
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,458
Yes.

975
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,500
-You have to help me with promotion again.
-Okay.

01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,458
I only need one.

980
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,333
Fifty is your change.

981
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:41,166
[Johnny] This is called a Magic Sponge.

982
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,208
It is incredibly absorbent.
Come, you can touch it.

983
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:46,375
Come, you can check it out.
Young girl, wanna check it out?

[raindrops pattering]

985
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:53,208
[Johnny] Don't miss it
if you're passing by!

986
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:57,791
Last time my guy in New York told me

987
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:01,875
you talked nonstop
for 15 hours on the plane.

988
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,875
That's not true.

989
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,583
Besides, we got along great.

990
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,958
As long as you know the drill.

991
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,458
Make sure she still looks
exactly like her passport photo.

992
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:16,000
You do the talking at the customs.

993
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,500
No worries.

994
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:21,458
Call me when you're back.

995
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:23,166
Okay.

996
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:26,083
Aren't you going to dance?

01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:54,333
[Ali] Boss, sorry.
I-Jing, take a break. I'll clean it up.

1001
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,416
[Shu-Fen] Cheng I-Jing!

1002
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,666
What are you doing?

1003
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,958
[arcade games bleeping]

1004

[sighs]

1005
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,916
[Mr. Yang] You tell me,
how many times have I come here?

1006
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,375
Did I receive the rent?

1007
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:40,458
Where is your credibility?

1008
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:44,041
I’m giving you a three-day deadline!

1009
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,125
The final deadline.
If you don't have the money, get lost.

1010
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:51,583
[Shu-Fen] If I had the money,
I'd definitely give it to you.

1011
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:54,166
Don't be like that. There are
so many people in the night market.

1012
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,916
What did I say
when you came the first day?

1013
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,166
I told you the payment's due
on the first of every month.

1014
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,458
-[Johnny] Don't be like that!
-What do you think this place is?

1015
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,666
-A charity?
-All right. All right.

1016
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,875
All right. Enough.

1017
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:06,375
Three days!

1018
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:13,916
[sobs]

1019
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:19,541
Shu-Fen.

1020
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,708
Let me help you.

1021
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:26,875
[sobbing softly]

1022
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,500
I'll figure something out.

1023
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,458
I'll get the money.

1024
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,416
[Shu-Fen sobbing]

1025
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,250
[voices speaking indistinctly on TV]

1026
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,083
Why are you smoking in my room?

1027
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,125
Go smoke on the balcony!

1028
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,125
[I-Jing] Why are you home?

1029
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:05,833
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

1030
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,541
Mind your own business.

1031
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,541
Is it not okay to watch TV?

1032
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:13,416
She hasn’t gone to work at this hour,
she probably got fired.

1033
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:25,125
[I-Jing] We're out of money,
you need to go to work.

1034
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,375
You're all talk.
Why don’t you go make money yourself?

1035
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:29,166
I am too young!

1036
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,250
[I-Ann] Whatever.

1037
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,250
[voices speaking on TV]

1038
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,583
I have something important
to discuss with Grandma later.

1039
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,958
Stay quiet over there, got it?

1040
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,083
Okay.

1041
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,916
Here you are.

1042
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,708
Come in.

1043
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,375
I am cooking braised meat.

1044
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,750
Hello, I-Jing, here you are.

1045
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,250
[Shu-Fen] Why are you here?

1046
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,750
Mom called and invited me over.

1047
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,750
Aren't you the one
who hates social visits?

1048
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,166
Go look at the fish.

1049
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,500
Mom, why did you tell her
I was coming over?

1050
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:28,250
-What's the big deal? This isn't a secret.
-But I need to talk to you privately.

1051
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,583
Why do you two always end up
arguing as soon as you meet?

1052
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,583
[sister] When did I argue with her?

1053
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,916
What secret are you trying to tell?

1054
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:39,875
Mom, I'm not asking for much.

1055
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:42,833
Only three months.

1056
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,000
It should take about three months
to get back to normal.

1057
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:48,958
I already promised your sisters
I would not lend you money anymore.

1058
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,458
What does it have to do with them?
I'm not borrowing from them.

1059
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:55,583
Why did you clean up his mess again?

1060
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:58,541
[bubbling]

1061
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:01,708
Fish are so dumb.

1062
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,916
Fish have no wisdom, so stupid.

1063
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,875
[grandma] At least you can help out
the family a bit, right?

1064
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,916
Don't forget, miss.

1065
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,833
You still owe me the rent for that house
and haven't paid me back yet.

1066
01:06:18,916 --> 01:06:20,083
[cell phone ringing]

1067
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,041
Hello?

1068
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:22,083
[A-Ming] <i>I-Ann?</i>

1069
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:23,041
<i>This is A-Ming.</i>

1070
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,208
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1071
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:26,333
Fuck you, shut up.

1072
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,500
<i>I have something important</i>
<i>to discuss with you.</i>

1073
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,250
What about when his factory closed down?

1074
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,708
Why didn’t any family members
come forward to help?

1075
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:36,708
[exclaims]

1076
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,625
You are such a pain.

1077
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,875
Cheng Shu-Fen. Get your facts straight!

1078
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:47,791
You're married off already. Shame on you!
How dare you come back to borrow money?

1079
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,083
[Shu-Fen] Why are you eavesdropping
on our conversation?

1080
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,833
I’m begging you, please wake up!

1081
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:54,791
How long do they need to drag on?

1082
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:56,750
How many times do you need to borrow?

1083
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:57,708
[in English] Hello?

1084
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:00,958
[in Mandarin] I can’t stand you repeating
the same thing over and over.

1085
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:04,125
All right. Stop arguing already!
My blood pressure is spiking!

1086
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:08,791
Let me tell you.

1087
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,625
I… really have no money to lend you.

1088
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,041
[sister] Heard it?

1089
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,833
No money to lend you!

1090
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:20,541
-If I were your son, you would have money!
-[grandma] That's right.

1091
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:24,750
A married daughter's like water that's
poured out. I treat my daughters nice.

1092
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,416
In the end,
you’re someone else's daughter-in-law.

1093
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,166
[sister] Mom kindly helped you.

1094
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,916
You should be more grateful.
When your husband runs away, don’t yell--

1095
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,625
-[Shu-Fen] Watch your bitchy mouth!
-[grandma] Stop talking nonsense.

1096
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:38,208
If it weren’t for the noodle stand
not being able to stay afloat,

1097
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,541
do you think I would be here?

1098
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,625
Whatever. I don’t know!

1099
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:53,416
[Shu-Fen] Let's go home.
Don't forget, you're a woman.

1100
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,458
Do you know this apartment has already
been transferred to our brother’s name?

1101
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:57,583
Idiot!

1102
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,041
Mom!

1103
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,625
-What is it?
-Is what she said true?

1104
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:10,791
What?

1105
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,291
Didn't you say this apartment
would be divided into three parts?

1106
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,750
[laughs nervously]

1107
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,875

1108
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,125
[Shu-Fen] I-Jing!

1109
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,666
Go help me arrange the chairs!

1110
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:51,041
I-Jing!

1111
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:54,708
I-Jing!

[cell phone ringing]

1117
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,916
Hello, I-Ann? This is A-Ming.
I have something to tell you.

1118
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,375
<i>-Whose number is this?</i>
-Don't worry about that for now!

1119
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:15,125
I called you nonstop,
but you didn’t answer.

1120
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,250
I have nothing to say to you.
Fuck your mother!

1121
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,458
Fuck your rotten stand.
Fuck your crazy, ugly wife!

1122
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,833
<i>The baby in your belly…</i>

1123

-[doorbell ringing]
-[grandma] Hm?

1133
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,833
Why are they here so early? Let me check.

1134
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,916
[voices speaking on TV]

1135
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,541
Are you Wu Xue-Mei?

1136
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,208
Yes. What's the matter?

1137
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:13,750
National Immigration Agency.
We're going to search your house.

1138
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:16,500
Please come in.

1139
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:28,000
I clearly put the passports
and tickets on the table yesterday.

1140
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,291
The cops came and suddenly
everything disappeared.

1141
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:33,958
I'm telling you,
everything suddenly disappeared!

1142
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:37,458
Mom, the police are already gone.
You don't have to speak so quietly.

1143
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:39,750
Also, why do they have a search warrant?

1144
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:43,291
<i>The District Prosecutor's Office</i>
<i>has legally indicted 21 people.</i>

1145
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,375
Thank goodness. I didn't end up in jail.

1146
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:49,416
Oh, what a blessing!

1147
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,208
[teacher] Okay, everyone be quiet.

1148
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,083
Line up two in a row.

1149
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:56,583
Come, go out and put on your shoes.
We can go outside and play now!

1150
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,833
-[girl] Play outside!
-[kids] Okay!

1151
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,750
[teacher] Find your own shoes
then move forward.

1152
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:12,541
Find your shoes then go to the front.

1153
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:15,041
Let others put theirs on. Be careful.

1154
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:19,416
The cops probably lifted the passports
when you weren’t looking.

1155
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,791
[sister 1] Oh, that's possible!

1156
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,958
You idiot!

1157
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:54,500
I'm telling you, no matter how much
you make, it's not worth the risk.

1158
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:58,333
How about you with your porno magazine
stash under the bed?

1159
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:01,208
When the police came they turned
everything over. Aren't you embarrassed?

1160
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,250
That's called art.
What the fuck do you know?

1161
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,458
Art my ass.

1162
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,791
They all look the same anyway.

1163
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,041
What a heathen.

1164
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:16,916
[door chime ringing]

1165
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:22,416
I have something very valuable for you.

1166
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,625
[man] What is it?

1167
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:26,791
[voices speaking on TV]

1168
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,208
Whose is this?

1169
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,666
Mine.

1170
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,208
Why are you pawning this?

1171
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,458
Because my mom has no money,
she needs money.

1172
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,375
Does she know you are pawning this?

1173
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,750
No.

1174
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,500
[pop music playing over speakers]

1175
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,916
[phone ringing]

1176
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,875
Try calling again, I dare you!
Believe me, I'll call the police!

1177
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,041
Huh?

1178
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,041
I thought the Devil Hand could help.

1179
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,000
What are you talking about?

1180
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:41,791
I wanted to get money to help Mom.

1181
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,791
What money? What Devil Hand?
I don't understand.

1182
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:47,083
This is my Devil Hand.

1183
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:51,458
I am not the one who stole things.

1184
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,958
It was my Devil Hand
that stole everything!

1185
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:55,458
Not me.

1186
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,333
Who told you all this?

1187
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:58,666
Grandpa.

1188
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,916
[I-Jing] <i>Slow down.</i>

1189
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,625
Cut it out! Hurry up.

1190
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,625
Where exactly are we going?

1191
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:08,416
Let's go visit Grandpa first.

1192
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,750
-[doorbell ringing]
-I-Ann?

1193
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,875
What's wrong?

1194
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:16,375
What's wrong?

1195
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,458
Grandma! Was it you who told her
this was valuable?

1196
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,166
The passports?! [gasps]

1197
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:34,250
My dear sweetheart, thank you.

1198
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:36,416
If it weren’t for you,
Grandma would be locked up.

1199
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,416
Thank you.

1200
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,625
The Devil Hand did it!

1201
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:40,583
Not me!

1202
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,666
Grandpa!

1203
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,791
Can you please tell her
there is no such thing as the Devil Hand?

1204
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,208
The left hand has always been
the Devil Hand, okay?

1205
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,000
You're not supposed to use
your left hand to do things.

1206
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,916
I'm telling you,
none of you are teaching her.

1207
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,625
Which era are you from?

1208
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:56,583
Women don't bind their feet anymore.

1209
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,458
Lefties are everywhere now!

1210
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:01,458
Please tell her.
The Devil Hand doesn't exist at all.

1211
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,458
Okay.

1212
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:04,208
There is no Devil Hand.

1213
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:08,208
It's God's hand.
It's the hand that saves Grandma.

1214
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,375
Grandma, can you stop confusing her?

1215
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:14,541
I-Jing, let me tell you.

1216
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:17,416
There's no Devil Hand
or any other supernatural hand.

1217
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,750
This is your hand.

1218
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,666
Do you hear me?

1219
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:25,083
I threw the ball with my left hand
and caused GooGoo to die.

1220
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:27,083
That was just an accident.

1221
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,708
Sometimes accidents happen.
No one can predict them, right?

1222
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:35,000
If that day… if you had thrown the ball
with your right hand,

1223
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:38,041
GooGoo would still have fallen, right?

1224
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:41,708
I've done a lot of bad things
with my left hand.

1225
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:44,416
Huh? What other bad things have you done?

1226
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:49,750
Did you steal all of this?

1227
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,000
My Devil Hand did it.

1228
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,791
Cheng I-Jing, you stole them.

1229
01:17:57,583 --> 01:17:58,583
[sighs]

1230
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,750
Do you know your child has been missing
for three hours?

1231
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,750
Wasn't she playing nearby?

1232
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,291
Let's go.

1233
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:20,666
Where are you two going?

1234
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:22,625
To teach her a lesson.

1235
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,125
By the way, this is from your mom.

1236
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:56,083
[pop music playing over speakers]

1237
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:00,458
I-Jing, are you here to visit me?

1238
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:04,291
Yes, I am here to return something.

1239
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,708
Mm. What do you say?

1240
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,666
I am sorry.

1241
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,208
I stole this.

1242
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,083
It's okay.
If you like something, just tell me.

1243
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:15,125
-Don't take it without asking.
-[I-Ann] I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

1244
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,458
It's all right.
I-Jing, come visit me next time.

1245
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:18,833
-Okay.
-[I-Ann] What do you say?

1246
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:19,958
Say thank you.

1247
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:21,166
"Thank you. Sorry."

1248
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,583
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1249
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:23,500
It's all right.

1250
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:25,791
Sorry about this.

1251
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:28,541
[I-Jing] Sorry, sis.

1252
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:31,083
It's okay. Go. Let's go.

1253
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:37,000
Where did you steal this from? That one?

1254
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,041
-Mm.
-That store?

1255
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,041
Wait.

1256
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:45,125
Go return it yourself.

1257
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,458
You have to apologize.

1258
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:47,583
-Got it?
-Mm.

1259
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:48,541
Go.

1260
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,916
[woman] I-Jing, here you are.

1261
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,791
I stole this.

1262
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:56,750
Huh?

1263
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:00,833
Okay. No big deal.

1264
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:02,375
No big deal, okay?

1265
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,541
-Don't do it again, okay?
-Okay.

1266
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,000
[woman] Okay.

1267
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:08,083
No big deal. Bye-bye.

1268
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:09,083
Mm-mm.

1269
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:17,083
-[I-Ann] Did you apologize?
-Yes.

1270
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,583
Did the owner forgive you?

1271
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:19,625
Yes.

1272
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,166
-You're doing great! Okay?
-Mm-hm.

1273
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,541
Remember to say sorry.

1274
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:27,083
You got it?

1275
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:37,541
I am sorry I stole this from you.

1276
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:41,458
-It's okay. Don't do it again.
-Mm-hm.

1277
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,375
Come here.

1278
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:54,541
I'm sorry I stole this from you.

1279
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:58,458
[woman] Little girl, you are here again?
Why did you take it?

1280
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:02,125
-Okay, it's all right. Don't do it again.
-[I-Jing] Mm.

1281
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:03,958
It's all right.

1282
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:05,625
Be good. Bye-bye.

1283
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:07,750
Don't do it again.

1284
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:08,791
Okay.

1285
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,625
Did you apologize?

1286
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:14,125
Did you? Okay, that's good. Okay?

1287
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,583
It's okay.

1288
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:33,166
[pop music playing over speakers]

1289
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,083
Turn around. I'll help you tie the bow.

1290
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:48,500
Okay. The bow is done.

1291
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:52,083
Are the night market sisters ready?

1292
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:53,833
Whoa!

1293
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:57,416
You are so pretty!
You are going to perform on stage, right?

1294
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,375
-She wouldn't dare.
-[vocalizing]

1295
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,791
-Are you two ready?
-Pretty. Ready?

1296
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:05,291
-Let's go. We can't be late. Hurry up.
-You ready?

1297
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,791
Let's go. Hurry up, we are late.

1298
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:10,291
[pop music playing over speakers]

1299
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,041
Hey.

1300
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,458
Your turn.

1301
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,250
-Where are we?
-Six.

1302
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,208
Seven.

1303
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:19,666
Why are you zoning out?

1304
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:22,833
Forget about her.

1305
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,166
Xiao-Ping is hotter.

1306
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,833
Stop acting like you know something
and talking nonsense.

1307
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:30,500
It has nothing to do with her. Seven.

1308
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:33,875
Always taking leave for no reason.
Always acting like a green-eyed monster.

1309
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,541
Why are you thinking about her?

1310
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,125
Taking days off?

1311
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,791
By the way, what's the date today?

1312
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:40,875
Friday.

1313
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:43,583
No, I mean the date!
Not what day of the week it is.

1314
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,208
The 15th.

1315
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:49,125
Didn't she say the 15th is
her grandmother's birthday?

1316
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,958
Yes, her grandma's birthday!

1317
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:56,125
Okay, thank you.

1318
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:59,166
You are very pretty, the best!

1319
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,875
You can have some appetizers
and drinks first.

1320
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:06,625
If you want to take photos together,
we are ready.

1321
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:09,041
-Is it the time to start?
-Yes.

1322
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,583
Okay, get off first.

1323
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:14,666
I'll help you with the helmet.

1324
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,458
Let me have it.

1325
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:18,875
[Shu-Fen] Let me help you.

1326
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,666
Good.

1327
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,500
-[Johnny] This one?
-Yes.

1328
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,958
-Hurry up.
-[I-Ann] Okay.

1329
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:26,958
Let's go.

1330
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:28,166
[Shu-Fen] Wait for me.

1331
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:37,541
[traditional music playing over speakers]

1332
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:41,250
Shu-Fen, they are all relatives today?

1333
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:42,666
-Should be.
-Oh.

1334
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:50,791
[Shu-Fen] You sit inside.

1335
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:51,833
[Johnny] Okay.

1336
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,208
-[sister 1] We're here.
-[sister 2] Big sis.

1337
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,708
How are you?

1338
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:57,416
Hi, everyone. My name is Johnny.

1339
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,208
-My boyfriend, Johnny.
-Xiao-He.

1340
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:01,666
-Xiao-He.
-Xiao-Hong.

1341
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,541
-Xiao-Hong, hi.
-This is my brother.

1342
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:05,416
-Her brother.
-[Johnny] Oh.

1343
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,125
Zhen-Xing, I am Johnny.

1344
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,416
[Zhen-Xing] Sit. Why don't you sit down?

1345
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,541
[Shu-Fen] Oh, I-Ann. Come say hi.

1346
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:14,000
[Zhen-Xing] You've grown up.

1347
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,000
Uncle.

1348
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,333
-Hi, Uncle. Long time no see.
-Hi.

1349
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:18,791
I-Jing, the little one.

1350
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:19,875
Her little one.

1351
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,250
-[Zhen-Xing] I haven't met her.
-I-Jing.

1352
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,333
[Shu-Fen] Say uncle.

1353
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:24,500
[in English] Hello.

1354
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:25,541
[in English] Hello.

1355
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:27,875
[Xiao-He] You guys go sit over there.

1356
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,791
Kids sit over there.
Auntie will take you there.

1357
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:30,833
Okay.

1358
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:32,333
[Xiao-He] Let the adults talk.

1359
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:33,541
Your daughter?

1360
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:34,875
[Johnny] Uh...

1361
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:37,791
No. We've only known each other
for six months.

1362
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,000
-Just met.
-Oh…

1363
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:41,375
Not long.

1364
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,750
[Xiao-Hong] Anything to drink?
Give me the cup. I will help you.

1365
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,375
-[Johnny] Anything.
-[Xiao-Hung] Okay.

1366
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:47,083
[I-Jing] Can I use your phone?

1367
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:51,750
May I ask, is there a Ms. Wu Xue-Mei's
birthday banquet?

1368
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:53,875
Yes.

1369
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:56,875
Is there?

1370
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,333
Okay. Thank you. Got it.

1371
01:24:58,416 --> 01:24:59,708
Bye-bye.

1372
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,083
Sis, you moved back to Taipei?

1373
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:10,833
How long are you staying this time?

1374
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:14,416
Mm. Just for the weekend.

1375
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,625
Work is busy.

1376
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,541
I just moved to Shanghai.

1377
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:21,375
-Johnny.
-Nice to see you.

1378
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,833
-Thank you for your hard work!
-Huh?

1379
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:23,833
My sister is difficult.

1380
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:27,250
Not at all. Your sister is very nice.

1381
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,000
And what do you do?

1382
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,083
Oh, I am in…

1383
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,000
trade.

1384
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:33,958
In trade.

1385
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:35,375
Oh. Really?

1386
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:36,666
Have you gone public?

1387
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,791
Yes. I'm at the night market.

1388
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:41,083
Public night market trading.

1389
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:44,791
Whatever you need. Let me know.
Anything you can't get, I can.

1390
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:47,208
-[Xiao-Hong] Okay.
-Okay, no problem.

1391
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,125
Thank you.

1392
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,750
[girl] Who are you?

1393
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:52,375
She's my younger sister.

1394
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,625
And what's your name?

1395
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,333
I-Jing.

1396
01:25:57,416 --> 01:26:00,208
The birthday star is here!

1397
01:26:00,291 --> 01:26:01,250

1399
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:05,458

1402
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:10,875
Thanks.

1403
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:11,958
[Zhen-Xing] Mom.

1404
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:12,875
Come here.

1405
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:18,500
Dad, you sit over there.

1406
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:20,125
I am sitting with my son.

1407
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:24,041
-You rushed over?
-My precious son.

1408
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,208
Dad and Mom, this is my boyfriend, Johnny.

1409
01:26:29,291 --> 01:26:30,125
Uncle.

1410
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,416
Auntie, happy birthday.

1411
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,083
Hello, nice to meet you.

1412
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,875
What do you do?

1413
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:41,833
He has a stand in the night market.
He is right next to Fen’s stand.

1414
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:43,541
Selling stuff. Selling stuff.

1415
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,125
I sell all kinds of things.
I have everything.

1416
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:49,083
If you need anything, let me know.

1417
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Hey, I have to go first.
Something came up.

1418
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,375
-You are on your own tonight, okay?
-Oh, okay.

1419
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:57,875
-Keep it up. Call me if anything comes up.
-Okay.

1420
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:00,000
What could possibly happen?

1421
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,458
I don't get it.

1422
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:04,541
All right then.
Next, let's give Mom a big applause!

1423
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:07,750
Say a few words to us. Mom!

1424
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:09,250
[applause]

1425
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:12,333
Thank you, thank you.

1426
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:14,541
Thank you everybody, welcome!

1427
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:17,875
Thank you for taking the time to be here.

1428
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,833
My precious son.

1429
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,958
So thoughtful. So devoted.

1430
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,958
To throw this party for me.

1431
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,083
Mom, happy birthday!

1432
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,333
[laughing] Thank you.

1433
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:30,500
Thank you.

1434
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:34,416
Before we all start eating,

1435
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,125
let's first make a toast,
wish Mom a happy birthday, all right?

1436
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:41,750
[all] Happy birthday!

1437
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,541
[Xiao-Hung] Happy birthday!

1438
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,625
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

1439
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,208
-Excuse me, excuse me.
-Uncle here.

1440
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,041
I'll get it myself.

1441
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,208
-Thanks.
-Okay.

1442
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:05,500
-[Shu-Fen] Are there no glasses?
-Over there. The drink you just had.

1443
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:06,958
Good girl.

1444
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:10,416
This is my favorite granddaughter.

1445
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:16,250
I mean, you are all my favorites.

1446
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,083
All my favorites.

1447
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,750
Grandma lied to them.

1448
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:23,291
You are my precious baby.

1449
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:26,458
[girl] Grandma. It's your birthday.
We toast to you.

1450
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:27,416
Happy birthday!

1451
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,125
Happy birthday!

1452
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,750
[Xiao-Hong] While everyone is eating,

1453
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:35,541
I want to take this moment
to wish my mom a very happy birthday.

1454
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:38,833
So I'd like to ask my daughter Meilin
to come up! Meilin.

1455
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,916
[applause]

1456
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:47,166
She also advanced to
the <i>Star Brilliance </i>Grand Finals.

1457
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,916
So she is going to sing the same song.

1458
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:53,875
The judge also mentioned
if she pursues opportunities in China,

1459
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:56,958
her future prospects will be incredible.
Woo-hoo!

1460
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,791
Mom, happy birthday!

1461
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:03,833
[singing out of tune to a backing track]

1462
01:29:07,916 --> 01:29:09,916
[all clapping and cheering]

1463
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:14,041
Why are you so slow?

1464
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,208
-You are very slow.
-Let's go, let's go.

1465
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,958
Let me go get her.
You wait here. Calm down.

1466
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:27,625
Calm down. Wait for me here.

1467
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,333
[A-Ming] I-Ann.

1468
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,375
Can you come downstairs with us?
We need to talk to you.

1469
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,583
[woman] Cheng I-Ann.

1470
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:47,166
-Fuck! What are you all doing here?
-Step outside to talk.

1471
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,500
Cut it out!

1472
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:53,208
We have something important to talk
to you about. Please step outside.

1473
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:55,625
I tried calling you
and you wouldn't answer. This is serious.

1474
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:57,291
Birthday banquet, how dare you come here?

1475
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:59,041
-I'm giving you a chance to save face--
-Sh!

1476
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:02,041
Get out!

1477
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,416
Come out to talk.

1478
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,166
Get out!

1479
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:06,750
I'm giving you a chance to save face--

1480
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,000
[I-Ann] Get out!

1481
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:09,333
[Shu-Fen] What's going on?

1482
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:11,833
-Sorry, this has nothing to do with you.
-I am her mother.

1483
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:13,333
You two need something?

1484
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:14,791
You are her mother?

1485
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:19,583
I am her former boss.
I need to talk to her. I am sorry.

1486
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:22,500
-We've been looking for her for two weeks.
-You fucking stinky bitch!

1487
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,000
Why are you doing this?

1488
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,916
Don't you know how many guests are here?

1489
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,250
I already quit, what the fuck do you want?

1490
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:34,416
[Shu-Fen] Shut up!

1491
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:36,541
Now you can tell me what happened.

1492
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:39,708
How did she offend you?
You feel the need to disturb the banquet.

1493
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:42,625
Well?

1494
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:44,375
No one wants to tell?

1495
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:46,458
Okay, I will tell you!

1496
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,458
Your daughter slept with my husband
and got pregnant!

1497
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:52,166
[A-Ming] There are a lot of people here.
Don’t be so loud.

1498
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,125
Is it true?

1499
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:03,250
It's none of your business.

1500
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,500
-I'm asking you if this is true.
-She told us herself.

1501
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,958
We have three girls now.

1502
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:12,208
If your daughter is having a boy,
it's ours.

1503
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:15,458
-Impossible! Are you out of your mind?
-[woman] Am I out of my mind?

1504
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:17,791
I don’t care
that you slept with my husband.

1505
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:21,000
At this point, I just need a son to help
divvy up the family fortune. Am I wrong?

1506
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,291
You slept with my husband for free!

1507
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:24,958
Enough. [clears throat]

1508
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:28,791
You don't need to worry about the money.
We would pay for everything--

1509
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,500
Can you shut up?

1510
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:33,708
We would pay for all expenses.
As long as she is having a boy,

1511
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:35,250
I'll pay for everything!

1512
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:37,416
-[sobbing]
-What's going on?

1513
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:40,125
I'm asking you if it is true.

1514
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,625
-Don’t do this!
-I'm asking you if it is true.

1515
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,750
Don't do this.

1516
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:46,208
[Shu-Fen sobs]

1517
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,916
-She told us she's pregnant.
-Enough.

1518
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,833
You are talking about this, right?

1519
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:55,250
That's long gone, bitch!

1520
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:00,500
-I am gonna fucking kill you today!
-[Johnny] What are you doing?

1521
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:01,625
Let go!

1522
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:04,333
-Let go!
-[A-Ming] Let's go back! Calm down!

1523
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:05,458
-[Johnny] Get out!
-Let's go!

1524
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:08,041
-She seduced my husband--
-I'll call the police if you don't stop!

1525
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:09,041
[A-Ming] Enough! Let's go!

1526
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,250
-[woman] Cheng I-Ann, go to hell!
-[A-Ming] Enough!

1527
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:12,375
It's okay.

1528
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:14,916
-[A-Ming] Let's go.
-Don't hold me back!

1529
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:16,500
[Johnny] Get out!

1530
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
[sobbing]

1531
01:32:22,291 --> 01:32:23,500
Why aren't you leaving?

1532
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:34,708
[A-Ming] Sorry.
Could you give this to I-Ann?

1533
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:47,375
You still haven't learned your lesson.

1534
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:55,041
When are you going to take
responsibility for your life? You…

1535
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:10,916
Sit.

1536
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:31,875
Is everything okay?

1537
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,750
It's okay.

1538
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:37,875
So…

1539
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,125
What happened up there?

1540
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:43,041
None of your business.

1541
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:50,000
The reason your mom was so angry is
because she cares about you.

1542
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:53,416
Do you even know my mom?

1543
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,833
Just because you slept with my mom
for two weeks, you get to be my dad?

1544
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,000
Sis, where did you go?

1545
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,375
I talked to her.

1546
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,041
There is nothing to talk about.

1547
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:36,250
She is helpless.

1548
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:46,875
[mic feeds back]

1549
01:34:47,458 --> 01:34:50,541
Sorry about the commotion earlier.
Disturbed everyone.

1550
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:54,791
First of all, thank you for attending
my dear mommy's 60th birthday banquet.

1551
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:58,625
My mommy did everything for me,
and my dear sisters.

1552
01:35:00,166 --> 01:35:02,416
Last year,
the world economy was really bad.

1553
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,708
So I started an international company.

1554
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:07,625
The purpose is to support more
families affected by unemployment.

1555
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:10,750
So they can achieve dreams and have hopes.

1556
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:13,000
And my biggest financial sponsor

1557
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:14,541
is my dear mommy.

1558
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:17,250
Please give this great philanthropist

1559
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:19,208
a big round of applause!

1560
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:21,291
[all clapping]

1561
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:26,125
[in English] Mommy! Happy birthday!

1562
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,875
[in Mandarin]
Wishing you have a long life.

1563
01:35:29,625 --> 01:35:31,625
[mic feeds back]

1564
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:34,708
Uh… [chuckles]

1565
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,625
Let's wish our wonderful mom…

1566
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,625
Thank you for giving birth to us,
and raising us, and teaching us.

1567
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:43,541
Happy birthday!

1568
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:46,625
May you have blessings as deep as the sea
and a life as long as the mountains.

1569
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:51,333
We prepared a special birthday cake

1570
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:53,083
for our mother.

1571
01:35:53,166 --> 01:35:55,916
Let's have the waiter bring it out,
shall we?

1572
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,291
Wait!

1573
01:36:04,166 --> 01:36:05,541
I have something to say.

1574
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:10,166
What's she up to?

1575
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:13,208
[mic feeds back]

1576
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:20,708
Grandma.

1577
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:25,625
Thank you for never treating me
like a child.

1578
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:28,375
[microphone thuds]

1579
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,041
[I-Ann] Excuse me.

1580
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:33,708
Sorry.

1581
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:39,500
Before we cut the cake,

1582
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:42,125
I-Jing and I want to say
happy birthday to you.

1583
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,166
Me first.

1584
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,625
Grandma, happy birthday!

1585
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:51,583
Next is I-Jing's turn.

1586
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:56,958
Hold this.

1587
01:36:57,541 --> 01:36:59,208
[whispering]

1588
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:06,625
Say it.

1589
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:12,375
Great-Grandma, happy birthday.

1590
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:17,041
Sweetie, you said it wrong!

1591
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:18,791
I am Grandma, not Great-Grandma.

1592
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,041
Say it again.

1593
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:22,333
Great-Grandma, happy birthday.

1594
01:37:24,416 --> 01:37:26,333
I-Jing is right.

1595
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,708
Grandma is I-Jing's great-grandmother.

1596
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,625
[all murmuring]

1597
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:36,291
My mom seriously thought
she could cover it all up--

1598
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:38,083
You're drunk.
Can you stop acting like this?

1599
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:40,333
-I am not drunk!
-Sorry, she drank too much!

1600
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,291
I gave birth to I-Jing, not you!

1601
01:37:42,916 --> 01:37:44,166
[Shu-Fen] What are you doing?

1602
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:46,666
-Can you tell me--
-She should know by now!

1603
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:49,750
What are you talking about?

1604
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:56,500
[sobbing] I only did it to protect you.

1605
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:58,000
Why don't you understand?

1606
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:03,583
You're so young.
With a kid, who would marry you?

1607
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:06,333
Why do I have to marry someone?

1608
01:38:07,166 --> 01:38:10,500
For my entire life, you only care
about saving your own face!

1609
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:12,833
Have you ever cared about how I feel?

1610
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:14,000
[Zhen-Xing] Mom.

1611
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,208
Why am I a great-grandmother?

1612
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,833
I am a great-grandmother?

1613
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:22,250
You better explain it right now!

1614
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:31,666
This is so humiliating!

1615
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:32,833
[sobs]

1616
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,333
Why does it have to be today?

1617
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:38,208
How could you lie to me
about something so serious?

1618
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:42,958
You’ve completely made me lose face!

1619
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:46,208
Do you have any shame at all?

1620
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:49,083
Do you really not want me
to live in peace?

1621
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:55,208
Or were you going to keep
this secret forever?

1622
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:00,708
That was my original plan.

1623
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:09,166
-Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!
-[Xiao-He] Mom! All right.

1624
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,208
[Xiao-Hong] Just calm her down first.

-[Zhen-Xing] Bring her back here.

-[Xiao-Hong] Go sit down.
-[Wu Xue-Mei sobbing]

1627

[Xiao-Hong] Go sit down for now.
Just go sit down first.
