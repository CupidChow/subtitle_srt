1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,356
A woman in her twenties took her own life

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,359
<i>because her ex-boyfriend
threatened that he'd distribute</i>

3
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:14,652
<i>an intimate video of them.</i>

4
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:17,238
<i>The prosecution refused
to arrest the perpetrator</i>

5
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,906
<i>because he's a medical student
at a prestigious university.</i>

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,576
<i>I will reorganize
and strengthen the legislation</i>

7
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,703
so that digital sexual violence
can be properly punished.

8
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:24,662
I promise you.

9
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:26,998
I don't know anything about politics

10
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,292
or how things work in your world.

11
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,544
But as you said, that's one of the things

12
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:33,504
-an assemblyman can do, right?
-Thank you.

13
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:36,382
<i>Ji, a medical student
and the assailant of Namgoong,</i>

14
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,217
<i>committed suicide by jumping
out of his apartment today.</i>

15
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,845
Someone died because of me.

16
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:42,597
This is just too hard.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,265
You're not to blame, honey.

18
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:46,476
You didn't know this would happen.

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,937
Unless a major case of sex crime occurs

20
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,315
that brings about a great public uproar,

21
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:55,359
it won't be easy to push ahead with a bill

22
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:56,944
in merely six months.

23
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:58,863
<i>She doesn't know yet.</i>

24
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:00,323
<i>That bastard uploaded the video</i>

25
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:02,408
<i>right before he jumped.</i>

26
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,285
<i>The suicide of a suspect</i>

27
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:06,496
<i>shouldn't get in the way
of destigmatizing the victims.</i>

28
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,207
Therefore, I would like to propose
an amendment to the sex crime law

29
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,042
that allows investigations to continue

30
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:16,089
even when the suspect is deceased
due to suicide or otherwise.

31
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:18,591
<i>I am going to convince the public
and gain their support.</i>

32
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,302
But first, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

33
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:23,805
<i>It's about my wife.</i>

34
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:26,224
That med student is obviously a criminal,

35
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:29,185
<i>but his family is
still here living in pain.</i>

36
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:32,522
If something else bad happens,
how will the rest of them live?

37
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:35,399
I wish you'd stop using the media
to make a bigger issue out of this.

38
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:37,110
I'm going to propose an amendment

39
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:40,988
that allows investigations to continue
even after a sex criminal dies.

40
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:44,575
<i>I need the support of my beloved wife.
It's the most important thing to me.</i>

41
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,328
The girl everyone considered
to be the innocent victim

42
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,498
turned out to be a sex worker.

43
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:54,502
It's only natural
that people see her in a different light.

44
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,963
We need Namgoong Sol
to propose the amendment, don't we?

45
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:58,131
How did you miss this?

46
00:01:58,214 --> 00:02:00,341
Nothing is going as planned!

47
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:03,219
<i>That's why this is the best time
to tell him to stop digging</i>

48
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:05,263
<i>around the real estate speculation.</i>

49
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:07,098
<i>What? Posted what?</i>

50
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:10,434
<i>Hey, Yoon-seo. Isn't this your dad?</i>

51
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:14,105
If you were using Sol to your advantage,

52
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,524
I will not let you get away with this.

53
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:18,025
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

54
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:19,819
<i>I had no idea what you were going through,</i>

55
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:21,904
<i>and I…</i>

56
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:24,532
<i>I love you. Don't ever doubt that.</i>

57
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:25,992
<i>I've never doubted you.</i>

THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

62
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:30,348
Is there something on my jacket?

63
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,183
No.

64
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:34,018
Here you go.

65
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:35,228
Thanks.

66
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,608
Take it easy until your injury is healed.

67
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,151
I'm fine now.

68
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,363
Your car will be delivered in a few days.

69
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:47,531
Are you sure you're okay with a used car?

70
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:49,784
I wanted to buy you a new car.

71
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,745
No, a used car is fine.

72
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:56,040
Besides, buying it through
Ms. Choi's father is even better.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,044
Okay.

74
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:02,004
I'm leaving now.

75
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,635
Have a great day.

76
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:22,066
I don't want to go.

77
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:33,202
-Bye now.
-Bye.

DEOKSUNG MILL

80
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,105
Good morning.

81
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,859
Sometimes I feel like you know me
better than my wife does.

82
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,819
Yes, I should.

83
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,989
But I don't think you know me well enough.

84
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:13,242
No, I didn't expect you would be here.

85
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:19,582
Goodness.

86
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:22,793
Well…

87
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:25,296
Come in and have breakfast.

88
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,520
-Here.
-Thank you.

89
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:47,735
Thank you.

90
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,494
Ms. Cho.

91
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:01,540
I haven't forgiven you completely.

92
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:06,504
But

93
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:08,964
in the work you do, Assemblyman Nam,

94
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:12,468
make use of this old woman
as much as you want.

95
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,848
<i>Your granddaughter is the victim,</i>

96
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:22,186
but she came under criticism
following the assailant's suicide.

97
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:29,068
That's why Assemblyman Nam is
trying to change the law.

98
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,531
Please don't be angry with him, Ms. Cho.

99
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:39,537
In return,

100
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:44,041
please fix that darned law.

101
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:48,295
Please fix it
so that even if a criminal dies,

102
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,924
the whole world will know
what they've done

103
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,801
and they can be punished.

104
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,472
I will do that.

105
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,183
I promise you.

106
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:07,273
After the video of Assemblyman Nam
getting beaten up went viral,

107
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:10,901
criticism against the medical student
is rising online.

108
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,697
But not enough to overshadow news of
Namgoong Sol's history as a sex worker.

109
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:18,492
Is it acceptable to illegally film
and distribute sex videos

110
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:20,494
as long as the victim is a sex worker?

111
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:21,662
That's ridiculous.

112
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:27,710
The timing would have been worse
if the bill had already been proposed.

113
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:29,795
You're right.

114
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,008
Then we'll need to find another case
that we can use to our advantage, right?

115
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,677
A sex crime
where the assailant killed themselves.

116
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:40,264
We may already have one.

117
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:51,400
My goodness.

118
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,569
-Hello.
-Hello.

119
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:57,072
Am I interrupting?

122
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,474
Will you wait for me outside?

123
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,311
Okay, I will.

124
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:46,830
-Oh, my. I'm sorry.
-Goodness. Are you okay?

125
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:49,500
-Yes, thank you.
-Sure.

LEE CHAE-EUN (OTHER MATERIALS)

127
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:14,400
Excuse me.

128
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,282
Are you Chae-eun's…

129
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:24,118
Who are you?

130
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:28,539
I said, who are you?

131
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,001
Look.

132
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,128
You should leave.

133
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,463
How dare you come here?

134
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:37,590
Leave. Now.

135
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,842
Who in the world are you?

136
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,176
How dare you come here?

137
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:45,389
-You have no right to be here!
-Yeo-jin!

138
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:47,308
-Yeo-jin.
-Let go and we'll talk.

139
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:48,809
Let go of me!

140
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,769
Seven years in prison doesn't cut it.

141
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,688
You should rot in prison for life.

142
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,982
Yeo-jin!

143
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,400
Just kill me.

144
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,152
Kill me.

145
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:01,071
Why can't you?

146
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,616
You tried to kill me then!

147
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:09,371
<i>I fell asleep next to Chae-eun,</i>

148
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,166
<i>but I woke up in the hospital.</i>

149
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:16,754
And I was told that my daughter…

150
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:20,215
was killed by her own dad.

151
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:22,885
But what?

152
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:24,303
Family suicide?

153
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:26,388
How is that suicide?

154
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,848
That was murder!

155
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,684
You're a murderer
who killed your own child!

156
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:34,980
You need to die too.

157
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:38,108
You killed your own child.

158
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,361
Are you too scared to die yourself?

159
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:42,821
-Then I'll kill you!
-Yeo-jin, please.

160
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:43,947
Fine, kill me!

161
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:46,450
Go ahead, kill me!

162
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:49,078
Please, Yeo-jin. Just go.

163
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:49,995
Hurry.

164
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,790
-Hye-joo, let go.
-Yeo-jin, please stop.

165
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,041
-Yeo-jin, please.
-Fine.

166
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:58,045
-Please.
-Fine, then we can die together.

167
00:10:58,128 --> 00:10:59,254
Let's die together!

168
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:00,881
That's enough!

169
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,549
Who in the world are you to…

170
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,052
Her family.

171
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:07,763
What?

172
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:09,848
I'm her family.

173
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:14,436
What family?

174
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,688
I'm Lawyer Nam Joong-do's wife.

175
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:18,273
Lawyer?

176
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:20,192
Leave.

177
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:23,362
Did you not hear me? Leave!

178
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:26,532
Leave and don't ever come back.
Do you understand?

179
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:35,791
It's okay, Yeo-jin.

180
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:37,835
It's okay.

181
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,753
<i>I didn't know your wife</i>

182
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,798
had such a history with my wife's family.

183
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:48,804
It's a small world, isn't it?

184
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,185
So you want to make a deal

185
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:59,481
with your in-law's land speculation

186
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:03,277
and my wife's incident?

187
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:08,407
I just don't think it's worth
your precious time

188
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:12,870
to be concerned about
a piece of land out in the countryside.

189
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,587
<i>Please give this to Chae-eun.</i>

190
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,339
<i>Who in the world are you?</i>

191
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,174
I'm her family.

192
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,977
<i>What? A million won?</i>

193
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,937
<i>I bought you that phone.</i>

194
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,357
So if you need it,
you can buy it back from me.

195
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,567
Okay?

196
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,705
Hey. Why aren't you coming in?

197
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:22,708
Are you looking for Ms. Hyeon?

198
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,834
She's not here today.

199
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:26,128
Why not?

200
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,590
The so-called father killed his child

201
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,216
and also tried to kill his wife,

202
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,260
but he only got seven years in prison.

203
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:35,178
Isn't that ridiculous?

204
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:37,389
-A life sentence--
-Yeong-seon, I'd like to pay.

205
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:38,765
Okay.

206
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,142
Gosh, that was good.

207
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:41,643
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes, here.

208
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,855
Do you have cash?

209
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:46,064
The machine is down.

210
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,649
-Again?
-Yes.

211
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,818
That never happens with Yeo-jin,

212
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:51,904
but it happens often with you.

213
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:53,947
Here.

214
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:55,449
The machine must know it's me.

215
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:56,366
Goodness.

216
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,493
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

217
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,054
I'm going to head to the restaurant.

218
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:18,013
Don't wait for me.

219
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,556
You said you'd take the day off.

220
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:21,683
I need to keep myself busy.

221
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:24,519
Okay then.

222
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:26,939
-See you later.
-Okay.

223
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:35,405
Hye-joo.

224
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,201
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:41,495
Yeo-jin.

226
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,172
To me,

227
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,549
you're family.

228
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:57,761
So don't say you're sorry

229
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,597
or that you want to die.

230
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:04,810
Just stay by my side for a long time.

231
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,269
Okay?

232
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:16,279
Where was I?

233
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:20,951
Thank you for the food.

234
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:22,828
Goodbye.

235
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,246
Hey.

236
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:28,750
-Sorry?
-You need to pay.

237
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:30,627
Right.

238
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:32,170
I will.

239
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:36,258
We only provide free food
for children and expectant mothers.

240
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:40,178
Goodness, Yeo-jin.

241
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:42,639
I thought you took the day off.

242
00:16:51,064 --> 00:16:51,898
How much do you want?

243
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:54,526
What?

244
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,153
Isn't that why you're here?

245
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:04,745
I need two million won.

246
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,125
Tell me your account number.

247
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:12,377
<i>She left your house?</i>

248
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:14,254
Hey, keep it down.

249
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:16,173
Right, sorry.

250
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,718
What about the baby? She's pregnant.

251
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,596
No idea. That's her problem.

252
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,974
But it's your nephew or niece.

253
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,226
What are you talking about?

254
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,355
Your brother's child
is your nephew or niece.

255
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,234
Anyway,

256
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,196
you can't tell anyone about this.

257
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,489
It's a secret.

258
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,199
Okay.

259
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:51,917
Hey, Yoon-seo.

260
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:55,378
You know that student who killed himself
after your dad exposed him?

261
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,047
Turns out his girlfriend was a prostitute.

262
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,217
And she accused him of illegal filming?

263
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,718
Unbelievable.

264
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:03,303
It doesn't matter what she did.

265
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:05,514
Non-consensual video sharing is a crime.

266
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:06,848
So is prostitution.

267
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,977
Your dad more or less
defended prostitution by taking her side.

268
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,146
How is that defending prostitution?

269
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:17,484
And it's not like she had an affair.

270
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,152
What? What do you mean?

271
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,613
Prostitution is illegal,
but adultery isn't.

272
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:23,198
Prostitution is a crime too.

273
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,283
Buying sex is the worst.

274
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:26,993
Adultery is worse.

275
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:29,329
It involves feelings

276
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,081
and you're betraying your family.

277
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,667
So it's utterly disgusting.

278
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:37,420
Right? Isn't it?

279
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:38,463
Right.

280
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:46,638
I sent it to you.

281
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:47,597
Okay.

282
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:51,351
You don't have to come here next time.

283
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:54,104
Just text me.

284
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:06,950
By the way…

285
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,538
why did you make seaweed soup for me?

286
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:18,336
To feign kindness?

287
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,466
Or so that I'd turn a blind eye?

288
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:33,310
Right.

289
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:35,103
About your kitchen staff.

290
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:38,064
When you're away, she pretends
the credit card machine is broken

291
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:39,566
and pockets the cash.

292
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,863
That's what it feels like to be betrayed

293
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,574
by someone you trust.

294
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:56,499
Hey, are you leaving?

295
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,336
Bye.

296
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:09,262
My husband was here this morning?

297
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:11,556
Yes.

298
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:14,142
At daybreak.

299
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,312
I see.

300
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,358
Last night,

301
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:25,946
I was quite angry at first.

302
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:32,911
<i>But how could they treat
Assemblyman Nam that way</i>

303
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:36,665
when their son is the one
who committed a crime?

304
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:43,296
That's why I told him to use me

305
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,758
to amend that law.

306
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:50,637
I promised to help however I can.

307
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:53,765
But Ms. Cho.

308
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,726
Once you step in,

309
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,356
people may criticize
you and your granddaughter.

310
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:04,359
I know.

311
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,655
But it's all right.

312
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:11,992
After losing my Sol,

313
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,036
the last thing I want to do

314
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:17,664
is sit around doing nothing.

315
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,169
If there is a way to punish that criminal

316
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:26,256
who ran away from his sins
by taking his life,

317
00:21:27,215 --> 00:21:28,800
I'll do anything.

318
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,887
Anything at all.

319
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:45,275
Look at this.

320
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:48,320
They're criticizing our son again.

321
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,780
I didn't post that article.

322
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:52,490
Then who was it?

323
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,075
I…

324
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,620
You were the only person I told

325
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:59,247
about how my son met that girl!

326
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:05,045
To be honest, I was going to write a post.

327
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:09,716
I knew that she'd be criticized
if people found out she was a prostitute,

328
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,178
and that it would also reflect badly
on Nam Joong-do.

329
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:18,058
But…

330
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:26,232
A SEX WORKER…

331
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:35,950
DISCARD DRAFT?

332
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:37,202
<i>…I didn't.</i>

333
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:41,331
I knew people would start
criticizing your son again,

334
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:44,084
and it'd make things even harder for you.

335
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,086
So I decided not to.

336
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:51,257
I know how that feels
better than anyone else.

337
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,305
It really wasn't me.

338
00:22:58,389 --> 00:22:59,307
Please believe me.

339
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:13,279
SEUNG-KYU'S DINING TABLE

340
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:16,282
I'll run some errands
and then take the bus home.

341
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:17,575
You should go home first.

342
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:20,245
Where are you going?

343
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:24,499
Don't tell me you're going to see Jae-eun.

344
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:28,253
I am.

345
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,631
I'll find her and call her a murderer
in front of everyone.

346
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:34,551
-Seung-hee.
-Why not? Can't I do that?

347
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:38,138
My family is suffering because of her lie.

348
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:41,641
I can't let her live a good life,
not even over my dead body.

349
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,275
Ki-young.

350
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:55,947
I'm your family.

351
00:23:56,823 --> 00:24:00,827
Are you sure you're not the one
who posted that?

352
00:24:01,995 --> 00:24:02,871
Ki-young.

353
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:08,751
It wasn't me.

354
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,177
Why can't you trust me?

355
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:28,313
Let's…

356
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:31,524
go to Australia, Seung-hee.

357
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,032
Let's leave everything behind

358
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,326
and go.

359
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:53,046
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:57,008
I can't leave my mom here alone.

361

KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

362
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:46,557
NAM JOONG-DO

363
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:50,728
That concludes our briefing session
for the residents on the reconstruction

364
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:53,356
of the Jicheong 2-dong
Administrative Welfare Center.

365
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:57,193
-Great work.
-Assemblyman Nam!

366
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:58,444
-Good work.
-Great work.

367
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,446
-Great work.
-Thank you.

368
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,614
-See you.
-Goodbye.

369
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:04,784
-We should grab a drink sometime.
-We should.

370
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:05,994
When?

371
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:07,829
Great work.

372
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:11,874
Hello, Assemblyman Nam.

373
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,794
Hello, President Bae Gyeong-guk
of Taeyang Arcade Co-op.

374
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,296
-Goodness.
-Are you well?

375
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:18,047
Yes, of course.

376
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:20,258
The reconstruction of this center

377
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:22,260
was a long-cherished wish
for us residents.

378
00:26:22,343 --> 00:26:24,637
Thank you very much.

379
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,680
I promised you,

380
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:28,099
but it took much longer
than I thought. I'm sorry.

381
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:29,851
Don't say that.

382
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:33,146
You must have had a tough time
after what happened to your family.

383
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:34,814
Thank you very much.

384
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:41,195
I was very grateful when you came
to my mother-in-law's funeral.

385
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:43,114
After she was buried,

386
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:45,700
your son's funeral
was held in the same funeral home,

387
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:48,536
and I felt very sorry for you.

388
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:52,248
Stay strong, Assemblyman Nam.

389
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:53,666
Thank you.

390
00:26:58,338 --> 00:27:01,382
-Great work, sir.
-Thank you.

391
00:27:20,276 --> 00:27:21,152
<i>Hello?</i>

392
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,363
Is that you, Soo-bin?

393
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:28,117
Who are you?

394
00:27:29,952 --> 00:27:31,329
Ji-hoon's friend?

395
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,376
Hello.

396
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:40,922
You must be Ji-hoon's mother.

397
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:43,841
Yes.

398
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:46,219
Take a seat.

399
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:50,723
Well…

400
00:27:51,557 --> 00:27:55,311
I was studying abroad
and was dealing with some important work.

401
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:59,148
That's why I only returned to Korea
after Ji-hoon's funeral.

402
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,276
I'm sorry.

403
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:04,946
It's okay.

404
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,906
Anyway,

405
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:10,034
how come Soo-bin's phone was with you?

406
00:28:10,118 --> 00:28:12,578
She asked me to hold on to it for her

407
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:15,164
when I met her after coming back to Korea.

408
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:17,834
But she's been out of reach since.

409
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,670
I see.

410
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,340
By the way,

411
00:28:24,424 --> 00:28:27,635
you know Soo-bin and Ji-hoon dated, right?

412
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:29,679
Yes.

413
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:36,602
I'm not really sure
if I should tell you this,

414
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:39,856
but I heard…

415
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:43,985
Soo-bin got pregnant with Ji-hoon's child.

416
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:47,238
I know.

417
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,074
Did Soo-bin tell you?

418
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:51,993
Yes.

419
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:55,455
She told me so that day,

420
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:58,458
then she completely went off the grid.

421
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,460
It was right after Ji-hoon's accident,

422
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:04,505
so I was quite worried
she'd make the wrong choice.

423
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:07,425
I'm relieved
that she was staying with you.

424
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:12,388
I wonder where she is now.

425
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:20,062
It's kind of awkward
for me to ask you this.

426
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:25,401
By any chance, did you notice
any money or valuables missing

427
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:28,446
after she left?

428
00:29:29,697 --> 00:29:30,531
Sorry?

429
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:35,203
The thing about Soo-bin is,

430
00:29:35,286 --> 00:29:37,580
she has sticky fingers

431
00:29:37,663 --> 00:29:39,332
and she isn't exactly a good girl.

432
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:43,628
I used to hang out with the wrong crowd
and it was all because of her.

433
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:46,297
Then I came to my senses and went abroad.

434
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:51,427
That's why I tried so hard
to talk Ji-hoon out of dating her.

435
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,445
Thank you for your time.

436
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:10,530
Don't mention it.

437
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:15,701
And can you tell Soo-bin to call me
when you get a hold of her?

438
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:19,330
Sure, but no matter what I say,

439
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:21,666
she might not call you.

440
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,172
But you never know, so just tell her.

441
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:30,800
Okay, I will.

442
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:34,637
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

443
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,229
So it was Nam Ji-hoon's kid.

444
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:47,149
How interesting.

445
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:09,380
<i>The thing about Soo-bin is,
she has sticky fingers</i>

446
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,591
<i>and she isn't exactly a good girl.</i>

447
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:34,405
REAL ESTATE OFFICE

448
00:31:34,488 --> 00:31:36,741
I don't need any premium
for the restaurant.

449
00:31:36,824 --> 00:31:38,618
I just want to sell it quickly.

450
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:40,703
And by any chance,

451
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:44,624
do you know any real estate offices
in other areas?

452
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:47,209
Are you opening a new restaurant?
Which area?

453
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:51,631
Just somewhere far from here.

454
00:31:51,714 --> 00:31:55,593
And I'm not opening a restaurant.
I'm looking for a place to live.

455
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:03,976
Kim Soo-bin will come back
even if we don't look for her.

456
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,312
That's what the likes of her do.

457
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:09,148
She'll come back
and blackmail you for money.

458
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,651
Blackmail me?

459
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,362
Yes, with her pregnancy.

460
00:32:18,574 --> 00:32:19,575
By any chance,

461
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:22,828
does she have anything else on you?

462
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,791
Like what?

463
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:31,754
Right.

464
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:33,297
Anyway,

465
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,259
even if she reveals her pregnancy online,

466
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:39,887
we can package it as a heartwarming story.

467
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:42,014
Especially so…

468
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:45,643
since Ji-hoon is no longer around.

469
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:50,690
So there's nothing to worry about

470
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,900
unless something else gets out.

471
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:56,612
Like what?

472
00:32:57,363 --> 00:32:58,239
Well…

473
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,199
drugs…

474
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:05,079
and possibly other things.

475
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:13,254
Ji-hoon was in possession
of methamphetamine,

476
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:17,091
but the investigation came to a stop
when he passed away.

477
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:19,427
So we still don't know

478
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:21,387
why he was in possession of that.

479
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:23,723
Right.

480
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:26,308
I had forgotten for a moment

481
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:29,228
that my son was like that.

482

Hello, Mr. Choi.

485
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:54,211
I'd like to share evidence
for the land speculation

00:34:22,573 --> 00:34:24,408
<i>I can't leave my mom here alone.</i>

489
00:34:52,937 --> 00:34:55,189
Goodness, Assemblyman Nam.

490
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:57,358
Are you going back to work at this hour?

491
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:00,611
I need to meet someone urgently.

492
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,031
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong.

493
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:13,833
I happened to overhear

494
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,460
Assemblyman Nam's
youngest secretary saying

495
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:19,797
the video from the hospital
went viral just in time.

496
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:24,051
It was quite naive of him
to think it was uploaded

497
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:25,886
by an actual civilian.

498
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:28,931
It's not that he's naive.

499
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,892
It just shows how much he trusts
the assemblyman he works for.

500
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:35,980
Do you also trust Assemblyman Nam?

501
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:40,860
You managed to use the one word
that least suits politics.

502
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:46,615
-Then what made you bring him on board
<i>-However, the murder of one's children</i>

503
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,951
-eight years ago?
<i>-is not aggravated</i>

504
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:51,036
<i>and is punished relatively lightly.</i>

505
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:53,455
<i>So back in 2006,</i>

506
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:55,916
<i>I filed a constitutional appeal</i>

507
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,294
<i>so that filicide would become
an aggravated crime.</i>

508
00:35:58,377 --> 00:36:00,504
<i>They should be punished equally heavily.</i>

509
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:03,924
<i>I hope the law changes
after this constitutional appeal.</i>

510
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:07,761
Do you remember
that constitutional appeal he filed?

511
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:12,516
Yes, but in the end,
he didn't achieve anything.

512
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,060
Except for a little commotion.

513
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:18,189
Do you really think
he got nothing out of it?

514
00:36:18,856 --> 00:36:19,690
Pardon?

515
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:24,653
Didn't you just ask me
what I saw in Assemblyman Nam?

516
00:36:24,737 --> 00:36:28,407
<i>…constitutional appeal demanding
heavier punishment for filicide</i>

517
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,327
<i>attracted much attention
and support from the public.</i>

518
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,494
SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN

519
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:34,997
<i>In 2 months, over 500,000 citizens signed</i>

520
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,375
<i>a petition to amend the Constitution.</i>

521
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:46,634
Mr. Park of Yangcheon-ri, Youngsan,
is great at his job.

522
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:51,972
But with the general election coming up,

523
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:56,185
I'm afraid we'll end up
in a mutual no-win situation.

524
00:36:58,187 --> 00:36:59,355
Well…

525
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:02,399
I guess you're right.

526
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:07,321
Assemblyman Nam,

527
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:10,199
you're such a straightforward man.

528
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:28,092
Hey.

529
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:30,219
You found a million won already?

530
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,221
Impressive.

531
00:37:34,974 --> 00:37:35,975
Sure.

532
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:38,477
Yes.

533
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,772
Then I'll see you
at Jae-ik's bar at two o'clock.

534
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:44,191
Okay.

535
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:02,251
NAM JI-HOON:
DON'T EVER SAY YOU WANT TO BREAK UP

536
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:03,460
<i>Ji-hoon!</i>

537
00:38:04,044 --> 00:38:05,921
Have you seen Soo-bin today?

538
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:07,923
Soo-bin?

539
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,384
No.

540
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:13,804
She's been out of reach all day.

541
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:14,930
What's she up to?

542
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:18,976
This is Assemblyman Nam Joong-do's place.

543
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:22,563
<i>Are you the father of her child?</i>

544
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:24,064
PREGNANCY WEEK

545
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:26,358
<i>I said, are you
the father of Soo-bin's child?</i>

546
00:38:26,442 --> 00:38:27,401
PATIENT: KIM SOO-BIN

547
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:36,577
So Ji-hoon got her pregnant,
got dumped by her, then kicked the bucket?

548
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:41,332
If he were alive, I would've killed him.

549
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:56,096
Ji-hoon's friend?

550
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,141
You met with his friend?

551
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:01,852
Yes.

552
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:02,978
How did you find him?

553
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:05,689
Well, I got a call.

554
00:39:06,315 --> 00:39:07,524
He called you?

555
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:09,693
What did you talk about?

556
00:39:11,278 --> 00:39:12,529
About Ji-hoon.

557
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:17,242
Don't ever meet or talk to him again.

558
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,912
I'm worried about you.

559
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:24,291
Why would you worry?
He's Ji-hoon's friend.

560
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,257
That's precisely why I'm worried.

561
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:38,180
Honey, the drugs Ji-hoon had on him…

562
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:42,059
I think they were Soo-bin's.

563
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:46,188
But she tested negative for drugs.

564
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:48,232
Dealers seldom use drugs.

565
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:50,067
They just sell them.

566
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:52,653
So honey,

567
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:57,658
forget about Soo-bin.

568
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:02,287
I know she grew on you,

569
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:04,957
but you shouldn't get involved with her.

570
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,001
I'm worried that you'll be hurt again.

571
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:11,588
And as you said,

572
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:15,467
we can't do anything
about her decision with the baby,

573
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:18,220
so let's forget it all.

574
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:25,310
Let's face it.

575
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,898
Ji-hoon made the choice he did…

576
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:32,776
because of her.

577
00:40:35,112 --> 00:40:37,406
That fact alone makes it impossible…

578
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,702
for me to accept her.

579
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:44,830
Right.

580
00:40:46,248 --> 00:40:49,418
Honey, when I see that text message,
it breaks my heart too.

581
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:52,296
But Ji-hoon's sui…

582
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:57,009
But Ji-hoon's…

583
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:01,054
incident wasn't Soo-bin's fault.

584
00:41:01,138 --> 00:41:03,223
Rationally, you're right.

585
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:06,894
But that's not how I feel
because this involves my son.

586
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,397
In my heart,

587
00:41:11,857 --> 00:41:13,901
Soo-bin is the one who killed him.

588
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:20,282
Don't get me wrong.

589
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:21,825
What I just said

590
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,537
is unrelated to what happened
to you in the past.

591
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:30,667
I know.

592
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:38,133
But honey, I hope…

593
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:43,722
<i>Soo-bin never finds out</i>

594
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:49,061
about the text message she didn't get.

595
00:41:50,771 --> 00:41:53,273
No one wanted
this unfortunate accident to happen.

596
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:56,944
I don't want her to live her life
thinking it was her fault, just as I did.

597
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:03,116
So honey, if she ever calls,

598
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:07,329
don't tell her about the text message.

599
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:08,956
I ask of you.

600
00:42:13,627 --> 00:42:17,839
I understand you resent her
for what happened, but still.

601
00:42:20,884 --> 00:42:21,885
Okay.

602
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:26,473
But she's not going to contact me anyway.

603
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,602
Thank you.

604
00:42:39,987 --> 00:42:41,321
But honey.

605
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:43,448
Yes?

606
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:47,786
Jin Seung-hee's uncle,
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong,

607
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:50,289
found out that you're my wife.

608
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:55,043
-What?
-But I made him keep his mouth shut

609
00:42:56,086 --> 00:42:57,879
thanks to Mr. Choi Ki-young's tip-off.

610
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,477
Honey.

611
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:16,231
Why don't we…

612
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:19,568
publicize your incident first?

613
00:43:20,986 --> 00:43:23,363
Why? He's keeping his mouth shut.

614
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:25,198
I don't trust Mr. Choi Ki-young.

615
00:43:27,117 --> 00:43:30,120
The evidence he gave me today was solid,

616
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:31,413
but I don't trust him.

617
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:35,584
He might be scheming with
Assemblyman Kang to stab me in the back.

618
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:38,754
Ki-young isn't like that.

619
00:43:38,837 --> 00:43:40,422
You don't know that.

620
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:43,425
Even if Mr. Choi is on our side,

621
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:46,678
he's family with Ms. Jin Seung-hee
and her mother.

622
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:52,434
So your story is bound to get out someday.

623
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:57,522
Before they break the story,

624
00:43:58,398 --> 00:44:00,651
we need to share it first
and get ahead of it.

625
00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:18,001
You don't know what I'm afraid of.

626
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:23,382
You don't know how painful it is
to be blamed for someone's death.

627
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:24,674
Of course I do.

628
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:27,427
People say…

629
00:44:29,805 --> 00:44:31,181
I killed that medical student.

630
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:47,739
I won't publicize your story

631
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,701
until you give your consent.

632
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:55,038
If you really can't go through with it,

633
00:44:55,956 --> 00:44:58,208
we won't be the one releasing it.

634
00:44:59,876 --> 00:45:00,919
But please know…

635
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:05,549
that your story will help greatly
in passing the amendment

636
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:09,886
I told you about.

637
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,943
I'm going to go out for a walk.

638
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:26,069
Honey.

639
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:28,405
It's chilly at night.

640
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:30,866
Don't stay out for too long.

641
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:03,148
SONMAT NOODLES

642
00:46:15,911 --> 00:46:16,828
Woo-jae.

643
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:18,955
Hello, Ms. Kim.

644
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,081
Hi.

645
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:26,254
What brings you here?

646
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:27,422
Well…

647
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:34,262
Today's Chae-eun's death anniversary.

648
00:46:35,514 --> 00:46:37,933
So I thought I'd stop by on my way home.

649
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:42,354
I'm sorry I came empty-handed.

650
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:44,564
I'll get something. You can stay.

651
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:46,858
No, it's okay. Don't get anything.

652
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:49,736
I was going to go home after this.

653
00:46:51,029 --> 00:46:53,073
Okay. Then take your time.

654
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,834
I heard you played a big part

655
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:07,212
in getting the story on the news

656
00:47:07,295 --> 00:47:09,422
after the constitutional appeal was filed.

657
00:47:10,048 --> 00:47:11,550
Well…

658
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:16,012
It was all Assemblyman Nam.
All I did was help.

659
00:47:16,096 --> 00:47:18,890
If he hadn't asked for help,

660
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:21,309
I wouldn't have even
thought of covering it.

661
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:25,021
Come to think of it,

662
00:47:26,189 --> 00:47:28,567
if I hadn't seen him work so hard then,

663
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:32,946
maybe I wouldn't be
slaving away in Yeouido now.

664
00:47:40,662 --> 00:47:41,955
Woo-jae.

665
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:45,292
I mean, Mr. Jang.

666
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:48,837
It kind of amazes me
how much trust you have

667
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,755
in my husband.

668
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:55,802
You even quit your stable job
to join my husband.

669
00:47:58,263 --> 00:48:00,599
Of course, my husband is a good man,

670
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,560
but you two were strangers.

671
00:48:07,439 --> 00:48:08,440
It's not that

672
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:12,485
I think he is a perfect man.

673
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:15,822
At times, he makes foolish mistakes,

674
00:48:15,905 --> 00:48:17,907
which makes him human.

675
00:48:19,284 --> 00:48:20,452
With that being said,

676
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:25,248
he never makes the same mistake twice.

677
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,670
While I was working as a reporter,

678
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:33,715
<i>there were times when I thought</i>

679
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:36,051
<i>I needed to do something
more than simply share</i>

680
00:48:36,134 --> 00:48:37,677
<i>the truth with the world.</i>

681
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:40,680
<i>And that's when Assemblyman Nam
asked for help.</i>

682
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:44,059
<i>As I watched him work,</i>

683
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:48,396
<i>I realized what I should do
and what I wanted to do</i>

684
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:50,857
<i>in the future.</i>

685
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,941
LAWYER NAM JOONG-DO

686
00:48:52,025 --> 00:48:53,568
<i>I was fortunate enough</i>

687
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:57,238
<i>to meet someone who had the same vision</i>

688
00:48:58,156 --> 00:48:59,199
for the world as I did.

689
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:03,953
Of course, Assemblyman Nam
and I were strangers.

690
00:49:04,954 --> 00:49:08,249
But so were you and him at first.

691
00:49:11,419 --> 00:49:12,837
And the same goes for you guys too.

692
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:15,173
You were once strangers,

693
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:17,634
but you're family now.

694
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,136
You care about and trust each other

695
00:49:22,305 --> 00:49:23,515
more than anybody.

696
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:30,897
HUSBAND

697
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,816
One second. Excuse me.

698
00:49:40,657 --> 00:49:42,033
Hello?

699
00:49:42,117 --> 00:49:43,993
<i>Where are you? I'll pick you up.</i>

700
00:49:44,536 --> 00:49:46,246
It's okay, I'm with Yeo-jin.

701
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:48,039
Don't worry. I'll be home soon.

702
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:50,625
What about Yoon-seo?

703
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,002
Not yet?

704
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:56,089
Okay.

705
00:49:57,215 --> 00:49:58,174
Bye.

706
00:50:11,104 --> 00:50:13,106
You came to tell me something, right?

707
00:50:17,444 --> 00:50:20,363
Don't do anything.

708
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:29,330
I came by for her death anniversary.

709
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:39,132
Are you leaving?

710
00:50:39,215 --> 00:50:40,842
Yes, please excuse me.

711
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:43,803
All right. Goodbye, then.

712
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:17,223
-Yoon-seo, you're home.
-Dad.

713
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:23,062
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

714
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:28,860
Do you want one?

715
00:51:28,943 --> 00:51:30,695
I shouldn't. I brushed my teeth.

716
00:51:30,778 --> 00:51:32,655
Come on. Try one.

717
00:51:32,738 --> 00:51:34,115
Open up.

718
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:40,621
-By the way, Dad.
-Yes?

719
00:51:40,705 --> 00:51:42,832
Why did that girl suddenly leave?

720
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:50,172
What if she tells everyone
that she's pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby?

721
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,384
It'll affect you, won't it?

722
00:51:54,886 --> 00:51:56,012
Yoon-seo.

723
00:51:57,305 --> 00:51:59,849
Have I ever made you worry?

724
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:03,102
No.

725
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:06,063
Then you can trust me,

726
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:09,233
study hard, and do your own thing.

727
00:52:09,942 --> 00:52:11,110
Okay?

728
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:13,988
Okay.

729
00:52:14,906 --> 00:52:16,616
-Anyway, Dad.
-Yes?

730
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:19,660
You just sounded like a total boomer.

731
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:21,787
Man, I don't want to be a boomer.

732
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:25,625
Then instead of studying hard,
study adequately.

733
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:27,001
-Deal?
-Deal.

734
00:52:29,462 --> 00:52:30,463
Dad.

735
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:33,424
I love you, Yoon-seo.

736
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:34,842
I love you too.

737
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:12,838
YOON-SEO'S HUNDREDTH DAY

738
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:43,244
Yoon-seo.

739
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:49,875
I don't have too many photos of Ji-hoon.

740
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,087
Do you have any?

741
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:56,173
Photos? Why?

742
00:54:07,893 --> 00:54:10,354
Are you happy
now that you made all of us sad?

743
00:54:28,622 --> 00:54:30,291
As Joong-do said,

744
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:33,044
it may be only a matter of time
before it gets out.

745
00:54:34,879 --> 00:54:35,796
But…

746
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:39,341
I'm scared.

747
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:40,760
Why?

748
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:43,179
Because it might turn into a dirty fight?

749
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,477
I think you should still trust Joong-do.

750
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,273
I do.

751
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,401
That's why I'm scared.

752
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,906
Of course I'm afraid
of all the finger-pointing I'll get…

753
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,701
That med student is obviously a criminal,
but what about his mom?

754
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:09,038
His family is still here living in pain.

755
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:12,249
If something else bad happens,
how will the rest of them live?

756
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:15,961
My mother-in-law is mentally unstable,

757
00:55:16,712 --> 00:55:18,631
so Seung-hee always feels restless.

758
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,761
But what if something bad
happens to his family?

759
00:55:30,976 --> 00:55:33,104
What do you think
is the right thing to do?

760
00:55:34,688 --> 00:55:37,525
Even if his family and I have to suffer,

761
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:40,569
can it be justified
as long as the amendment can pass?

762
00:55:42,446 --> 00:55:44,573
Because it's for the greater good?

763
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:00,798
That incident in Youngsan.

764
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:06,804
You can disclose it.

765
00:56:11,392 --> 00:56:15,312
I'm only giving my consent
because it'll help the amendment pass.

766
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:20,860
But please make sure
I don't have to appear in public.

767
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,696
Can you promise me that?

768
00:56:37,668 --> 00:56:38,752
I promise.

769
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,715
Thank you for making a tough decision.

770
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:47,011
I'm sorry for putting you
through a hard time.

771
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:07,531
Trust me.

772
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:11,869
No matter what happens,

773
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:14,705
I will protect you.

774
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:19,293
I do trust you.

775
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:22,546
I don't doubt you.

776
00:57:26,258 --> 00:57:27,301
I love you.

777

-She's here.
-She's here.

778

Ms. Kim Hye-joo.

779
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:21,981
Did you really kill someone 20 years ago?

780
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:23,524
-Tell us!
-Please answer us.

781
00:58:23,607 --> 00:58:26,193
-Is this true?
-Were you involved in someone's death?

782
00:58:26,277 --> 00:58:27,403
Tell us the truth!

783
00:58:27,486 --> 00:58:28,779
<i>Kim Jae-eun.</i>

784
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:30,322
Yes?

785
00:58:34,868 --> 00:58:36,412
You killed him. You murderer.

786
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:39,290
Get out. How dare you come here?

787
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:42,585
Get out of here this instant!

788

<i>My child died because of you.</i>

789

<i>You murderer!</i>

790
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:58,100
-Do you admit it?
-Are you involved in the murder?

791
00:58:58,183 --> 00:58:59,184
<i>Trust me.</i>

792
00:59:02,062 --> 00:59:03,355
