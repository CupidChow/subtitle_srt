1
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,777
-There's a wake I have to attend.
-Whose wake?

2
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,864
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law passed away.

3
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,200
But isn't it too late right now?

4
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,452
I have a tight schedule tomorrow.

5
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,204
It's better to go now.

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,793
<i><font color="white">He came around dinnertime</font></i>

7
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,629
but he didn't even stay for dinner
because he was busy.

8
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,843
The night Ji-hoon died,

9
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,264
Mr. Nam was the last person he met.

10
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,058
What?

11
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,769
What about you, sir?
Did you meet with him?

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,646
No.

13
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,127
Honey.

14
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,796
Did you meet

15
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,466
Ji-hoon that night?

16
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,302
What?

17
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,472
On the night of Ji-hoon's accident.

18
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,225
Did you meet him?

19
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:49,859
After you came home from work
that evening,

20
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,779
you got a call from Woo-jae
and went to attend

21
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,365
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law's wake.

22
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,577
But he told me

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,748
that you came around dinnertime,

24
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,375
not at night.

25
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,673
Who did you go out to meet that night

26
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,635
after you lied to me
saying Woo-jae called you?

27
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,725
Did you meet…

28
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,353
Ji-hoon?

29
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,113
Why won't you say anything?

30
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,572
I didn't meet him.

31
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,660
You didn't?

32
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,330
Then who was it?

33
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,084
Who did you meet
that you had to lie to me about it?

34
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:55,258
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:58,761
I can't tell you.

36
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,099
Why can't you tell me?

37
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,561
Are you having an affair?

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,188
Hye-joo, what do you mean?

39
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,273
That's absurd.

40
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,024
Then who in the world did you meet?

41
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,485
Was it really not Ji-hoon?

42
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,990
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

43
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,997
We need to get back to the office,
so let's just have one drink each.

44
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,291
-Thank you.
-Okay.

45
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,752
Oh, my goodness. What was that?

46
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,337
-Here you go, Bit-na.
-Thank you.

47
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,839
-Thank you for your work.
-Sure.

48
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:35,840
This thing is awesome.

49
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,967
-Third term! Let's go!
-Let's go!

50
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,264
Look, it's Assemblyman Nam.

51
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,059
7 OUT OF 10 SUPPORT NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW

52
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,438
To be honest, I was a bit skeptical

53
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,274
about pushing for Namgoong Sol's Law.

54
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,152
There are a lot of juridical issues.

55
00:03:56,235 --> 00:04:01,199
But seeing how huge
the response from the public is,

56
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,242
I'm beginning to think

57
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,703
it may actually pass.

58
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,997
We have nothing to lose
even if it doesn't pass.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,250
Grabbing the public's attention
will definitely help us in the election.

60
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,631
To be frank,

61
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,883
I was really shocked.

62
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,221
How could someone like him
have a son like that?

63
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,016
And I'll be honest.

64
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,477
I get that his son
made a really bad choice,

65
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,521
but when he called
his own son out publicly,

66
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,440
for the first time,

67
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,983
he kind of scared me.

68
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,986
You shouldn't be scared by that.

69
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,196
You should be impressed.

70
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,739
That's right.

71
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,741
Here's your pork belly.

72
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,743
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

73
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,620
-Would you like another glass?
-Sure.

74
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,039
Excuse me.

75
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,459
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

76
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,756
Hey, Yeong-su.

77
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,595
What?

78
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,437
Sorry, one minute.

79
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,441
What is it?

80
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,529
What?

81
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,240
A post written by Jin Seung-hee
is spreading quickly.

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,668
Mom.

83
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,421
I wrote all about it online.

84
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,091
That Seung-ho died
because Kim Jae-un framed him

85
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,051
saying he molested her.

86
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,471
What?

87
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,183
You've lived in agony
and grief for so long.

88
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,895
It'll be over soon.

89
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,900
Right.

90
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,408
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO'S WIFE
KILLED MY TWIN BROTHER

91
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,119
20 YEARS AGO IN YOUNGSAN…

92
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,168
HE HAD THE NERVE TO PROPOSE
NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW

93
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,586
IT WOULD ONLY PROTECT THE LIKES OF HER

94
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,004
HE'S COVERING UP
HIS WIFE'S WRONGDOING

95
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,059
LEE JAE-U, GYEONGHU DAILY REPORTER

96
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,287
Stop reading them.

97
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,923
Since the case was never
properly investigated,

98
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,175
it'll be up to the court
of public opinion.

99
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,970
The public will decide
who is telling the truth.

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,432
So don't hide.

101
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,850
You have to stand tall.

102
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,604
That's the only way
people will believe you.

103
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,150
What I'm saying is…

104
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,152
Let's go on TV.

105
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,238
We're all out of options.

106
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,536
You keep pressuring me to go on TV.

107
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:37,581
Are you sure you haven't
made that decision before asking?

108
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,417
-Hye-joo.
-Answer me.

109
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,043
I didn't.

110
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,378
Believe me.

111
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,337
No.

112
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,674
I can't believe you right now.

113
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,509
Hye-joo.

114
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,678
I just don't understand
what could be so bad

115
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,930
that you'd rather have me
think you're cheating

116
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,974
or if there even could be
something so bad.

117
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,440
I'll think about going on TV.

118
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,900
Just give me some time.

119
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,655
Okay.

120
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,497
Mom.

121
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,917
Why were you in Seoul?

122
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,627
What?

123
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,756
Do you still not remember
why you drove yourself to Seoul?

124
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,008
You can't drive too well.

125
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:32,470
I don't know.

126
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,056
My head hurts. I'm going to sleep.

127
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,736
UNCLE

128
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,870
<i><font color="white">The person you are trying to reach is…</font></i>

129
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,288
Darn it.

130
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,502
Why won't she pick up
after making such a mess?

131
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,879
This way, ma'am.

132
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,672
My goodness.

133
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,508
Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok.

134
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,218
Good evening.

135
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,677
I'm sorry for being late.

136
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,304
Not at all.

137
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,014
You're right on time.

138
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,974
Please have a seat.

139
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,025
So you'll make sure
that all the pending bills

140
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,529
proposed by the Daehan Party
will pass the deliberation process

141
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,572
at the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee?

142
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,825
Is that what you're saying?

143
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,328
That's correct.

144
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,623
I'll make sure

145
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:47,128
that at least ten of them will pass.

146
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,175
On what condition?

147
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,180
I'd like for the Daehan Party to oppose

148
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,725
to Namgoong Sol's Law
proposed by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

149
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,313
There's no way it will pass anyway

150
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,608
due to the juridical issues involved.

151
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,444
I just…

152
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,698
don't want to see you get swept up
in Assemblyman Nam's incitement

153
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,326
and waste your energy in the wrong places.

154
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,913
Strictly speaking, it's not impossible.

155
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,248
It's simply difficult.

156
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,169
If he can win over the public,

157
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,588
who knows what will happen?

158
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,843
You have several
excellent public welfare bills

159
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,805
pending at the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee.

160
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,765
Yes.

161
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,267
And it's all thanks to

162
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,936
the Nation and People's Party.

163
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,984
That is exactly why I'm making this offer.

164
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,280
A mere penal code amendment

165
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:59,450
that will only benefit
a handful of people,

166
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,119
or ten welfare bills

167
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,829
that can benefit countless people.

168
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,209
Which one do you think is more valuable?

169
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,317
I'll sleep in another room tonight.

170
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,253
Can't fall asleep?

171
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,964
Because of that online post?

172
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,259
There is that.

173
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,183
Is there something else?

174
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,187
Did you have a fight with Joong-do?

175
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,029
No.

176
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,322
Go to sleep, Yeo-jin.

177
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,519
The online post is undermining
the favorable public opinion

178
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,397
that formed after you proposed
Namgoong Sol's Law.

179
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,815
Right.

180
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:59,778
The point of this bill is
to allow investigations to continue

181
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:05,075
even after the sex offender dies
in order to bring justice to the victim,

182
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,494
and the post claims that Ms. Kim

183
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,331
framed an innocent person for a sex crime

184
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,084
and drove him to his death.

185
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:19,798
Reporters have been calling all morning.

186
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,428
It's only a matter of time
before this gets covered by the media.

187
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,268
I know you're all frustrated,

188
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,729
but please give me time
to figure out my next move,

189
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:38,150
and tell the reporters
that I'll make a statement soon.

190
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,072
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

Nam Joong-do's wife framed
an SNU law student-to-be

200
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,239
of a sexual crime

I'm in front of her house
to meet her right now.

203
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,585
Nam Joong-do of the Daehan Party
is misleading the nation

204
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,631
with a disgraceful bill
named after a prostitute

205
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,925
when this was revealed about his wife.

206
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,927
How ironic is that?

207

-Are you okay? I'm sorry.
-Yes, I'm fine.

<i><font color="white">as the trainer is unavailable
due to personal reasons.</font></i>

213
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,390
Mr. Choi went to the Seoul headquarters
for the CS training.

214
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,350
He went to the Seoul headquarters?

215
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,104
I thought the training
took place last week.

Yes.

Yes.

231
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,013
What happened to her brother
wasn't so shocking,

232
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,180
but this totally was.

Okay. I understand.

Apologize to Jae-eun…

No.

277

You should beg for her forgiveness.

No.

279
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,785
I could never do that.

280
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,330
Mom, I got into
the SNU School of Law today.

No, right?

Seung-hee.

Do you have anything to tell me?

I do.

292
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:50,976
Jae-eun

293
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,103
didn't lie.

294
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,107
She was molested by Seung-ho.

295

-What?
-Your mother was the one who lied.

She's been deceiving you for 20 years.

I'm innocent.

299
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,666
Kim Jae-eun is lying.

300
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,793
Seung-ho was innocent when he died.

301
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,878
He told me so.

302
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,297
That's not true.

303
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,756
He lied to you.

304

Before he died,

305
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,094
he came clean with your mother.

Did you meet with Jae-eun?

You did.

Do you like her?

309
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,322
Is that why you're accusing
Seung-ho and my mom of lying?

310
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,531
To defend her?

311
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,657
Seung-hee.

Seung-hee.

315
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,045
He was scheming with
Jae-eun's husband behind our backs.

316
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:05,592
He was going to give him
evidence of my real estate speculation.

317
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,261
I came to Seoul to confront him
and got into that accident.

318
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,013
Ms. Lee!

Choi Ki-young.

320
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:12,891
Is this true?

321
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,603
Seung-hee, let's talk outside.

322
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,521
You can leave.

323
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,941
Get out.

324
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,984
Right now.

325
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,699
What's the point of advocating
severe punishment for sex crimes

326
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,618
and conducting seminars?

327
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,537
We can't keep our own people in order.

328
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,415
Assemblyman Nam,
what's the matter with your family?

329
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,376
This will affect the general election.

330
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
Leave the party!

331
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,254
Look, Assemblyman Nam.

332
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:47,884
You should give up on
that Namgoong Sol's Law first.

333
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,928
With the election coming up,

334
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:53,515
I'm afraid a sensitive issue like this
will divide the people.

335
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,435
Bringing the people together
should be our priority.

336
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,772
I'm sorry for causing a stir.

337
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,609
But I will take care of my wife's case,

338
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,612
and I'll win the public over again.

339
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,324
Just like you said,
this is a sensitive issue.

340
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,120
If we handle it well,
it'll help us greatly in the election.

341
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:17,122
So I'm…

342
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,999
asking for your support.

343
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,546
Chairwoman Woo,
haven't you always supported

344
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,090
severe punishment for sex crimes?

345
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,468
I need your help.

346
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,054
We already have a ton of bills

347
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,807
pending at the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee.

348
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,226
Why would we put
all our eggs in that basket?

349
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,486
Mom, I'm here.

350
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,530
Hey, Yoon-seo.

351
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,244
You're here.

352
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,913
Did you come straight from school?
Are you hungry?

353
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,917
-Mom.
-Yes?

354
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,211
I read the post.

355
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,300
You did?

356
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,718
Yes.

357
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,761
But Mom.

358
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,018
You didn't lie, did you?

359
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,022
-Yoon-seo.
-After reading that post,

360
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,732
I'm having doubts.

361
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,277
You are an innocent victim

362
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,738
like you told me before.

363
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,657
Right?

364
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:43,249
Yoon-seo.

365
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,003
I didn't lie.

366
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:50,840
Why would I lie about that?

367
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,136
After he died, I was really--

368
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,513
But it's just odd.

369
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,475
He got into SNU
and had a bright future ahead of him.

370
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,768
So why would he do that?

371
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:06,105
Hye-joo, I'm here.

372
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,732
Are you telling the truth?

373
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,442
Can I believe you

374
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,196
instead of everyone else?

375
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:18,910
You didn't lie to get money, did you?

376
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:20,161
Yoon-seo!

377
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,096
Yeo-jin.

378
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,682
Can you take her to your restaurant?

379
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,769
Are you sure
you don't want to come with us?

380
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,649
Yes, I have some work to finish
before I leave.

381
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:55,488
Okay.

382
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,448
Call me.

383
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,786
Yoon-seo, let's go.

384
00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:06,291
Yoon-seo.

385
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:11,522
Sir.

386
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,483
Yes?

387
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,945
Ms. Kim called.

388
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,198
Some people showed up outside your house.

389
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,575
Because of that online post?

390
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,701
Yes.

391
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,205
She's at her studio right now.

392
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,375
They were gone by the time
Mr. Yoo went to check.

393
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,546
HYE-JOO

394
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,633
Hey, honey.

395
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,301
I'll go on TV.

396
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,513
And I want to do it as soon as possible.

397
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,432
If I can't avoid it,
I might as well get it over with.

398
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,019
Okay.

399
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,022
-Then--
<i><font color="white">-Hye-joo.</font></i>

400
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,359
Thank you for your courage.

401
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,778
I mean it.

402
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,048
She says she'll go on TV.
Let's do it tomorrow.

403
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,593
Not today?

404
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,639
No one cares about a guy
who puts out a small fire.

405
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,892
Let's wait for it to turn into a wildfire.

406
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,897
But the longer we wait,
the riskier it will be for us.

407
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,191
Those currently supporting
Namgoong Sol's Law

408
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,860
might turn their backs on us.

409
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,902
I know.

410
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,864
But for that law to pass,

411
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,825
I have no choice but to take a gamble.

412
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,662
But Ms. Kim will suffer
and be condemned for that much longer.

413
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,879
I have no choice

414
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,213
for the greater good.

415
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,633
Plus, I'm doing all of this

416
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,719
for her sake as well.

417
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,347
Yes, sir.

418
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,810
<i><font color="white">Ms. Jin accused my wife on the internet.</font></i>

419
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,479
What?

420
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,480
She did?

421
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:17,857
I guess you didn't know.

422
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,526
As a result,

423
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,820
my wife is suffering greatly.

424
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,371
I'm determined
to get to the bottom of that case.

425
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,042
<i><font color="white">And I'm about to give you

Okay.

434
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,450
Thank you.

435
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,536
Like I promised,

436
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:13,704
I'll keep you anonymous.

437
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,540
I'm giving you the evidence,

438

but not because I'm afraid
my wife will find out.

439
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,214

Bye.

447

DA-SOM'S MOM (HWANG JI-SOO)

448
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,169
Hey, Ji-soo.

449
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,466
Can I call you back? I'm a bit--

450
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,805
About Ji-hoon?

451
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,810
Let me get you on an IV first.

452
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,979
You look so pale.

453
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:21,522
Tell me what you wanted to say.

454
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,572
Actually,

455
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,324
I'm not supposed to tell you this

456
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,117
because of doctor-patient confidentiality.

457
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,538
But I thought you could
get some weight off your chest.

458
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,501
The…

459
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,339
The girl who was allegedly
sexually assaulted by Ji-hoon…

460
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,635
Is her name Kim Soo-bin?

461
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,222
How did you know that?

462
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,849
I see.

463
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,769
Last time we met…

464
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,441
Who's that in the picture?

465
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,486
She's Ji-hoon's…

466
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,489
<i><font color="white">I recognized her in the photo
that you dropped.</font></i>

467
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,868
She was a patient of mine.

468
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,663
She didn't know she had a miscarriage.

469
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,584
She had a miscarriage?

470
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,420
I guess you didn't know.

471
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,215
It was a missed miscarriage.

472
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:36,264
So…

473
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,101
So is she okay?

474
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,812
She came back with abdominal pain
after the surgery.

475
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,981
But it was nothing serious.

476
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,943
By the way,

477
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,445
did she tell you

478
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:55,116
that the baby was Ji-hoon's?

479
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,618
Yes.

480
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,415
Was it not?

481
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,003
No, it wasn't.

482
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:12,675
She got pregnant
while Ji-hoon was in prison.

483
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:15,052
So it couldn't have been his.

SOO-BIN, I'M IN TROUBLE
PLEASE ANSWER YOUR PHONE

489
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,822
How have you been?

490
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:50,254
She had the miscarriage
about eight weeks into her pregnancy.

491
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,215
Apparently, he was drunk.

492
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:57,970
<i><font color="white">Ji-hoon passed away about two weeks</font></i>

493
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,598

494
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:09,899
<i><font color="white">That means she became pregnant
during his time in prison.</font></i>

495
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,527
The pregnancy test kit can be inaccurate,

496
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,447
so I had a blood test
at the hospital yesterday.

497
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,575
This number means I'm five weeks pregnant,

498
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,036
so I got pregnant three weeks ago.

499
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,832
Which means there's no way
it could have been Ji-hoon's baby.

500
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,004
And I don't think

501
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,215
she was sexually assaulted either.

502
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,512
I have a question about induced abortion.

503
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,681
I was told at another clinic

504
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,724
that it's now legal

505
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,227
for someone who isn't
a rape victim to get it.

506
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,772
Anyway,

507
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,151
do you do that here?

508
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,240
I wasn't raped

509
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,659
or anything like that.

510
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,038
She said that she wasn't raped,

511
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,331
so it must be true.

512
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,960
Although you'd have to ask her to be sure.

513
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,559
Not who you were expecting?

514
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,771
You're so naive.

515
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,775
Why is Ji-hoon's family such a mess?

516
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,027
Even his mom made the news today.

517
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,405
Why?

518
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,907
When she was young and money hungry,

519
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,827
she framed a top student
for molesting her,

520
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,287
and he killed himself.

521
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,582
His sister exposed her online.

522
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,917
<i><font color="white">Yeo-jin.</font></i>

523
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,838
Back when I lived in Youngsan,

524
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,383
my friend's brother died.

525
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:04,722
I was molested by him,
so I went to the police.

526
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,309
And that night,

527
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,521
he killed himself.

528
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:16,942
She really was molested.

529
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:18,569
It's true.

530
00:37:18,652 --> 00:37:19,862
Who cares?

531
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,492
You know,

532
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,205
when I first found out you were pregnant,
I thought I was the father.

533
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,791
So I regretted breaking up with you.

534
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,876
It would have been the token of our love.

535
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,086
-I was pissed to find out Ji-hoon--
-Hold on.

536
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,300
How did you know I was pregnant?

537
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,183
What?

538
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,018
Ji-hoon's dad

539
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,104
didn't mention that
at the press conference.

540
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:55,606
How did you know?

541
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,030
Were you the one
who sent my medical records

542
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,116
to that other assemblyman?

543

Did you go through my phone too?

544
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:11,455
What did you expect after betraying me?

545
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,126
I didn't do much.

546
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,089
<i><font color="white">I found a medical document on your phone.</font></i>

You said the assailant was your boyfriend.

550

Why did you frame Ji-hoon for rape?

551
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,314
You couldn't get any money
because his dad told the press, right?

552
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,156
Hey.

What?

556
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,134
You lent out your bank account

And it doesn't seem like

he sexually assaulted her.

That's a huge relief.

590
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,857
Soo-bin told me

591
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,694
that Joong-do met Ji-hoon

592
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:55,405
just before his accident.

593
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:01,120
But Joong-do says
that he didn't meet him that night.

594
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,165
But he won't tell me who he met.

595
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:09,545
He lied to me
that he was attending a wake.

596
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:14,967
I even asked him
if he was having an affair.

597
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:19,638
But he still wouldn't tell me.
Who could it have been?

598
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,768
But you know what?

599
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,439
He told me he'd been
blackmailed by Soo-bin.

600
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,734
But what if…

601
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,196
God forbid, what if that was a lie?

602
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:41,535
I'm just so scared that there might be
something else I don't know about.

603
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:49,376
But I can't believe
everything Soo-bin tells me.

00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,131
I can't trust anybody right now.

I was wondering why
Ji-hoon had meth on him.

611
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:49,311
You had him make a drop, didn't you?

No.

I told him to deliver it

But he refused, so Ye-eun went instead.

But he snatched it

618

before the client could pick it up.

619
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,249
He refused to get involved in drug dealing

only to use it himself.

00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:12,370
Okay.

643
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,123
Good.

644
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,134
You're still up.

645
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,262
It's late.

646
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,518
TV is scheduled for tomorrow.

647
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,398
If you ever felt like
I was pressuring you to do this,

648
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,026
that's my fault.

649
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,529
I'm sorry.

650
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,783
Honey.

651
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,412
What you should be sorry about is

652
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,623
what happened that night.

653
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,546
Are you really not going to tell me
who you met that night?

654
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:15,684
Do you know how it feels
when the husband that I love

655
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,644
is hiding something from me?

656
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,151
It's a living hell.

657
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,740
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

658
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:40,792
I met Ji-hoon that day.

659
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,130
Ji-hoon?

660
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:50,427
You met him that night?

661
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,429
Is that true?

662
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,723
That's not what you said yesterday.

663
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,144
That night…

664
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,023
I…

665
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,069
scolded him.

666
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,912
Sir. You didn't drink too much, did you?

667
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:21,041
No, the patron didn't seem to drink much.

668
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,877
<i><font color="white">I'm almost home.</font></i>

669
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,053
NAM JI-HOON

670
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,644
Long time no talk, Ji-hoon.

671
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,854
How have you--

672
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,149
What?

673
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,235
You called me for the first time in months

674
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,779
to tell me you got in trouble while drunk?

675
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,364
What are you--

676
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,075
<i><font color="white">So get over here right now!</font></i>

677
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,036
Where are you?

678
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,288
Text me the address.

679
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,501
HYE-JOO

680
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,964
<i><font color="white">Okay. Get home safely.</font></i>

681
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,508
I swear, this kid…

682
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,596
Where are you meeting him? I'll drive you.

683
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,349
I can't go right away.

684
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,434
I told Hye-joo I was almost home.

685
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,522
And I can't tell her
he got in trouble again.

686
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,818
She might actually collapse
from the shock this time.

687
00:50:33,571 --> 00:50:35,323
You should go home and come out later.

688
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,616
I'll give you a call.

689
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,077
Tell her you're attending

690
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,540
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law's wake.

691
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,797
Why won't you let your mom live in peace?

692
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,301
Think about all the times
you got in trouble!

693
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,969
Get it together!

694
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,557
I got pretty upset with him.

695
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,687
And he passed right after.

696
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,859
It drove me crazy.

697
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,864
So when you asked me about it,

698
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,118
I got flustered and I lied to you.

699
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,830
I was in so much pain…

700
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,917
that I didn't want to tell anyone.

701
00:51:30,503 --> 00:51:32,047
Especially not you.

702
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,759
I really wanted to

703
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,636
hide it from you.

704
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,226
That's why I couldn't tell you.

705
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,899
I'm sorry

706
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,735
for hurting you.

707
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:02,035
Fine. I'd rather you disappear
than cause trouble like this!

708
00:52:11,669 --> 00:52:12,712
No.

709
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,257
Don't blame yourself, okay?

710
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,094
You had no idea

711
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,722
that it would be

712
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,017
the last time you'd see Ji-hoon.

713
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,515
CURRENT HUMIDITY

714

what I was going to tell you there was…

It was that your husband
might have killed Ji-hoon.

What?

Ji-hoon told me

he was going to confront his dad
about the affair that day.

You're having an affair.
