HUSBAND

3
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,078
Hey.

4
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:08,705
What's up?

5
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:09,831
Honey.

6
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,126
What's going on?

7
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,169
This may shock you, but…

8
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:19,674
Ji-hoon…

9
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:27,765
committed sexual assault.

10
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,062
What did you say?

11
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:36,357
Ji-hoon did what?

12
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:40,570
Honey, wait--

13
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,280
Hold on.

14
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,283
What do you mean?

15
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,327
Ji-hoon did what to whom?

16
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:55,084
Honey, I don't understand
what you're saying right now.

17
00:01:58,296 --> 00:01:59,589
Honey.

18
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:04,385
Kim Soo-bin.

19
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:08,890
Kim Soo-bin blackmailed me.

20
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:11,059
She claims she was raped

21
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:13,853
and that she'll expose it.

22
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,649
So I'll be holding a press conference…

23
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:20,568
in an hour.

24
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,987
Before Kim Soo-bin goes public with it.

25
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:37,126
No, honey, give me some time
before the press conference. Please.

26
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:39,462
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,799
No, wait. Honey!

28
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:46,052
CALL ENDED

29
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:11,119
First, Ms. Namgoong Sol,

30
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,621
then Ms. Kim's old incident,
and now his son.

31
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:15,957
It's one sex crime after another.

32
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,584
Jamsil Baseball Stadium
holds up to 25,000 people.

33
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:21,170
And with 30,000 sexual offense
cases reported annually,

34
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:23,923
that's over 80 cases a day.

35
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,550
It's a common occurrence.

36
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:33,683
I'll hold a press conference at 11 a.m.

37
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:50,283
The person you are trying to reach is…

38
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,665
Honey, please give me some time.

39
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,209
Pick up your phone.

40
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:01,794
Please.

41
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:18,019
I have to call her. Kim Soo-bin.

42

KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

43
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:25,109
The phone is turned off…

44
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:30,907
Oh, no.

45
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:49,884
HYE-JOO

NAM JOONG-DO

48
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,678
-Ms. Kim.
-Hello.

49
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,720
Where is…

50
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:41,435
I am…

51
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,231
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do

52
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,568
of Sinyang, Seoul.

53
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,779
Today, I came to know that

54
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:53,948
my son, who passed last month,

55
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,534
had a girlfriend

56
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,704
prior to his death…

57
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:05,459
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO PRESS CONFERENCE

58
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:07,920
…whom he sexually assaulted.

59
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:13,342
Hence, I apologize
from the bottom of my heart

60
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:16,304
to the victim and the citizens.

61

BELATED DISCOVERY OF
DECEASED SON'S SEXUAL ASSAULT

62
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:38,534
APOLOGIES TO THE VICTIM AND CITIZENS

63
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,918
REALITY

64
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:48,628
Also…

65
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:58,304
allow me to share

66
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:01,974
the details of the bill I wish to propose.

67
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,900
I am proposing

68
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,986
an amendment to the Criminal Act

69
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,531
that allows investigations to continue

70
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,953
even if the assailant is deceased
from suicide or otherwise.

71
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,792
You must all remember Ji…

72
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,086
Ms. Kim is at the office.

73
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,630
…to distribute an intimate video
of his ex-girlfriend,

74
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,841
causing her to take her own life.

75
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:38,844
He then committed suicide

76
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:42,515
when his arrest warrant was issued.

77
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:45,935
This amendment I am proposing

78
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:48,354
will be named after the victim,

79
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,942
the beloved granddaughter
of Ms. Cho Gwi-soon here,

80
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:56,487
and it will be called

81
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,824
Namgoong Sol's Law.

82
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:09,166
Under the current law,
when the assailant of a sex crime dies,

83
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,919
the investigation can no longer continue,

84
00:08:12,878 --> 00:08:16,298
which deprives the victim
of a chance to reveal the truth.

85
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,342
Therefore,

86
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,595
I propose an amendment to the Criminal Act

87
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:24,348
that allows investigations to continue

88
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:27,351
by retaining the right of arraignment

89
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:31,480
even when the sex offenders are deceased
due to suicide or otherwise.

90
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,067
The place is well-kept.
Thank you for showing it.

91
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:36,318
I'll give you a call.

92
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:37,570
Please do.

93
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:39,905
-Let's go.
-Okay.

94
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,991
-You know…
-Yes?

95
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:44,869
The place I told you about…

96
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,958
Come to the National Assembly right away.

97
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:00,051
Hello, sir.

98
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:11,187
NAM JOONG-DO

99
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,137
I asked…

100
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:49,225
I asked you to wait, honey.

101
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,646
I just needed a bit of time.

102
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:56,398
How could you do this?

103
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,944
How could you go ahead
with something like this

104
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:01,946
without talking to me first?

105
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:06,659
Soo-bin told me
that wasn't the case, honey.

106
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:09,328
When?

107
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:14,083
I asked her on the day
she first came to our place.

108
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:19,839
Did Soo-bin really tell you…

109
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:23,801
that Ji-hoon did that to her?

110
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,928
Did she? When?

111
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:29,807
She was here this morning

112
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,184
and threatened…

113
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,479
to disclose it.

114
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,656
Ja-young is giving Ms. Cho a ride home.

115
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,950
The phones will start
ringing off the hook--

116
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,082
Please respond the way I told you.

117
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,750
-Yes.
-Yes.

118
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:00,629
Hello?

119
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:04,383
-Hello, sir.
-Assemblyman Nam Joong-do's office.

120
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:09,638
Hey, Yeong-su.

121
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:21,400
Kim Soo-bin showed up this morning.

122
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:24,028
Should I write a post online?

123
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,239
She said Ji-hoon raped her
and got her pregnant.

124
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,951
She wanted to expose it.

125
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:34,079
That makes no sense.

126
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:39,126
Why would she have come to us then?
There's just no way.

127
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,211
And why would she deny it when I asked?

128
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:44,924
Who knows?

129
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,344
We know nothing about her past.

130
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:51,722
Do you believe her?

131
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:53,682
How?

132
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:58,687
You believed her enough
to hold a press conference.

133
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,899
She showed me her OBGYN records.

134
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,194
The doctor referred her

135
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,780
to a sexual assault victim support center.

136
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,574
She even has records
of her counseling sessions.

137
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:14,244
And think of everything Ji-hoon had done.

138
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:17,915
This isn't too far-fetched.

139
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,922
What did she ask for?

140
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:32,304
She must have blackmailed you
because she wanted something in return.

141
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:34,515
Was it money? How much?

142
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,060
Fifty million won.

143
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:42,272
It looks like I need
at least 50 million to find a place.

144
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:46,443
Honey.

145
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,990
If you had told me on the phone,

146
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:54,243
I would have found a way
to get 100 million, let alone 50.

147
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:55,619
Because I…

148
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:02,626
DON'T WASTE MY TAX MONEY
AND JUST EXECUTE HIM

149
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,044
BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY

150
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,587
DISGUSTING CRIMINAL

151
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:08,007
I GUESS THIS KID DOESN'T HAVE
DADDY COVERING HIS ASS

152
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,466
MAKE SURE HE ROTS BEHIND BARS!

153
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:19,184
How could you do this?

154
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:24,523
It was hard for me too.

155
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:29,486
But I couldn't let her blackmail me.

156
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,031
No secret lasts forever.

157
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:36,493
When you've done something wrong,
the best way to be forgiven is

158
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:39,538
to own up to it and ask for forgiveness.

159
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,457
It was for Ji-hoon's sake.

160
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,127
That's why I decided to come clean.

161
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:50,299
Taking a preemptive measure
was the only way.

162
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,384
Please understand.

163
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:55,929
A preemptive measure?

164
00:13:57,514 --> 00:13:58,682
Is that really all?

165
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,435
You're not

166
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,064
using Ji-hoon for your bill, are you?

167
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,232
What?

168
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:10,194
You decided to publicize my story
before asking me.

169
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:13,697
Did you set everything up
before letting me know today too?

170
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:15,449
Because you knew I wouldn't approve.

171
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,076
-Honey.
-Isn't that the case?

172
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:20,746
If you only confessed
because you'd been blackmailed,

173
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:22,498
why did you bring up the bill?

174
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,166
And when did you bring Ms. Cho?

175
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,209
Hye-joo.

176
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,086
That really isn't the case.

177
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:29,254
Do you think I'd use my son
for my political…

178
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,561
I guess I already
lost your trust yesterday.

179
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,022
It's all my fault.

180
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:51,402
I was going to propose
the bill soon anyway.

181
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:54,363
So if I had to disclose Ji-hoon's crime,

182
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,866
I wanted to divert
the attention away from him.

183
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:03,122
-We don't have any comments besides…
-Please refer to the statement we sent.

184
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,790
NAM PROPOSES NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW

185
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:07,418
If I hadn't mentioned the bill,
the news would only be

186
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,629
talking about Ji-hoon now.

187
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,846
This is too much for me to handle.

188
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,602
So this is how politics works.

189
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,566
You once asked me this.

190
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,235
Do you regret…

191
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:39,324
getting married to someone
who wants to be in politics?

192
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:41,660
Do you regret it?

193
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:44,204
I don't regret it.

194
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:45,914
Never.

195
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,462
But I do regret it now.

196
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,675
It's like I don't know you at all.

197
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:04,558
Hye-joo.

198
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,569
He must be insane.

199
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:17,696
Where did he get the idea
to call in reporters

200
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,615
and confess his son's sex crime?

201
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:23,118
But it's much better
than having the Nation and People's Party

202
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,369
expose it first.

203
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,872
Not when it's a sex crime.

204
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:28,290
What about the party's image?

205
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:29,917
Tell him to leave the party!

206
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,418
That's unnecessary.

207
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:35,214
Many people are applauding
his honest confession.

208
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:37,257
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party

209
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:39,801
held a press conference today
and confessed

210
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,803
-the sexual assault
-Watch your step.

211
00:16:41,887 --> 00:16:44,848
committed by his deceased son,
which caused a stir.

212
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:46,225
Namgoong Sol's Law…

213
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,392
Ms. Kim Hye-joo.

214
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,355
Were you aware of your son's sex crime?

215
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:53,649
-Don't film her.
-Why are you here?

216
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:54,733
Stop it.

217
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,152
Assemblyman Nam used
the medical student case

218
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:58,820
to cover up his son's drug usage.

219
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:01,615
-Today, he proposed a controversial bill.
-Watch the stairs.

220
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:03,951
He seems to keep covering up
his son's wrongdoings

221
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:06,119
using other people's misfortunes.

222
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:07,746
Any comments on this?

223
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,498
Hye-joo, don't answer. It's okay.

224
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,460
Your son was a hindrance
when he was alive.

225
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:15,212
Has he become a political tool now?

226
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,630
Look here!

227
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:18,173
-Are you--
-Ma'am.

228
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:22,302
You just crossed the line.

229
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:25,764
Have a little respect and courtesy.

230
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:30,352
Just because you're covering politics
doesn't mean it's okay to be inhuman.

231
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:35,566
Let's go, Hye-joo.

232
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:36,525
Come on.

233
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,903
Call me if you have anything to tell us.

234
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:40,862
Get out of the way.

235
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,002
Hye-joo.

236
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,298
Let's go home for now.

237
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,509
Yeo-jin.

238
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,599
People didn't believe me either back then.

239
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:10,434
Are you saying

240
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,312
Seung-ho molested you?

241
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:16,231
Stop lying.

242
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:19,026
Do you expect me to believe that?

243
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,195
They called me a liar.

244
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:25,282
It felt so unfair and harsh.

245
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:29,369
But now I'm thinking…

246
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,333
that Ji-hoon might have done bad things,

247
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,127
but he wouldn't have
done something so terrible.

248
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,088
I hear there's proof,

249
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:41,715
but I still can't believe Soo-bin.

250
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:45,427
I just wish she was lying.

251
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:49,264
But…

252
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,517
I, of all people,

253
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:57,356
shouldn't be doubting her, right?

254
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:14,247
YOON-SEO'S TEACHER

255
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:20,337
-I see.
-Sir.

256
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,798
-I appreciate your support.
-Please don't swear at…

257
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,760
Your press conference will be

258
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:29,429
the headline of
every news channel tonight.

259
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,098
CHOI JUN-WON, MBS REPORTER

260
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:34,226
Also, heated debates are going on

261
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:37,229
regarding Namgoong Sol's Law
on many online forums.

262
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:43,819
Anything about Ji-hoon?

263
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:44,778
There's a lot.

264
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,535
I canceled all of your schedule today.

265
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,579
You should go see Ms. Kim
before it gets late.

266
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,962
…loses its right of arraignment,
and the case is closed.

267
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:05,340
This morning, Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party

268
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:07,718
held a press conference
and disclosed a sex crime

269
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,387
that his deceased son committed…

270
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,472
-Sir, can you turn off the radio?
-before death.

271
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,891
-Sorry? Sure.
-Even after the sex offender dies…

272
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:17,060
Thank you.

Seung-hee.

278
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:00,812
You should get something to eat.

279
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,356
You haven't eaten anything all day.

280
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:05,609
I'm fine.

281
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:09,446
The doctor said Mom will wake up soon.

282
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:11,323
But still.

283
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:13,784
I'll stay with her,

284
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,410
so go grab a bite.

285
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,871
I'll call you when she wakes up.

286
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:51,363
You!

287
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:55,742
Are you the one who ratted out
Mr. Park to Nam Joong-do?

288
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:58,370
Mark my words.

289
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,956
I won't let you two

290
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:04,543
get away with this.

291
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:16,972
That's about his son who died, right?

292
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:18,557
Yes.

293
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,893
And Nam Joong-do came out
and said it himself.

294
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:26,189
Your neighborhood's going to get noisy.

295
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:28,316
I know.

296
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,485
I voted for him last time.

299
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,843
Seung-ho.

300
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:00,223
It's all right.

301
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:05,103
Nobody believes

302
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:08,732
Jae-eun.

303
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:12,360
I will…

304
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:16,239
take your secret with me

305
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:18,700

Aren't you going to tell us
why you fought?

310
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,908
Yoon-seo.

311
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:01,785
Why did you two fight?

312
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:11,378
Nam Ji-hoon.

313
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:15,423
Because of Nam Ji-hoon.

314
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:18,718
-He raped her.
-Raped?

315
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:21,179
What? He raped her? Impossible.

316
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:22,764
Her brother did drugs too.

317
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,058
No, he didn't.

318
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:29,062
And we don't know if he really raped her.
Don't jump to conclusions.

319
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:33,400
I mean, your dad says it's true.

320
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:36,236
Rape? Don't you think that's disgusting?

321
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,363
-Hey, Jang Hyeon-seo!
-Yes.

322
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:40,782
It's the worst.

323
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:45,370
-What?
-I'll say it again.

324
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:48,498
Sex offenders should drop dead.

325
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:50,792
Hey, Da-som.

326
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:02,178
Mom.

327
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,223
Did he…

328
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,643
really do that?

329
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,897
No, right?

330
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:14,524
It can't be.

331
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:18,111
Goodness.

332
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:20,405
I'm sorry I'm late.

333
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:23,032
I was with a patient
and wasn't able to check my phone.

334
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:25,243
Da-som.

335
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:27,704
Did you and Yoon-seo fight? Why?

336
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:31,875
Yoon-seo.

337
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,591
What's wrong? What is it?

338
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:48,183
Let's talk about this after your classes.

339
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:50,685
Submit an apology letter too.

340
00:25:51,644 --> 00:25:52,729
-Okay.
-Okay.

341
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:12,290
Hye-joo.

342
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:16,878
I'm sorry. One second.

343
00:26:18,963 --> 00:26:19,839
Hello?

344
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,300
Yes. You mean Ms. Kim Si-nae?

345
00:26:23,468 --> 00:26:24,928
How much has her cervix dilated?

346
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:35,980
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

347
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,318
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

348
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:43,738
Ms. Kim must be quite shaken up.
Please look after her.

349
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:15,353
DAON WOMEN'S CLINIC

350
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,362
-Hye-joo.
-Yes?

351
00:27:26,114 --> 00:27:27,740
Right, we're here already.

352
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,619
I'm sorry I can't take you home.
I have a patient in labor.

353
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:33,913
No, it's all right. Thank you.

354
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,291
You look awful right now.

355
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:39,168
Come up with me
and get an IV and some rest.

356
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:40,336
I'm fine.

357
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:43,756
-I'll be going. See you later.
-Bye.

358
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,593
-Oh, my.
-I'm sorry, Ji-soo. One second.

359
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,595
It's okay. Take your time.

360
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:54,350
Ms. Kim Soo-bin.

361
00:27:58,563 --> 00:27:59,772
-Hye-joo.
-Yes?

362
00:28:00,565 --> 00:28:02,567
Who's that in the picture?

363
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,283
This?

364
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:11,910
Who…

365
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,620
is that?

366
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:19,626
She's Ji-hoon's…

367
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:27,050
-Bye then.
-Okay. Bye.

368
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:30,470
See you.

369
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:50,615
I just parked. I'll be right up.

370
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:53,618
By the way,

371
00:28:54,452 --> 00:28:57,497
the patient we had on an IV
for stomach pain earlier…

372
00:28:58,498 --> 00:28:59,707
Has she left?

373
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,501
DAON WOMEN'S CLINIC

374
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:03,002
Soo-bin.

375
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,046
Soo-bin!

376
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,340
Soo-bin, did Ji-hoon really do that?

377
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:10,093
Is this true? Did Ji-hoon do that?

378
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:15,515
Say something.

379
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:16,975
Is this true?

380
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:18,559
Soo-bin!

381
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:20,895
People are looking.

382
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,272
Let's talk somewhere else.

383
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:33,408
Soo-bin.

384
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:37,120
When I asked you before,

385
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,541
you told me that wasn't the case, right?

386
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,459
So…

387
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:44,961
So why?

388
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:47,255
Did he really…

389
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:49,966
Did Ji-hoon really

390
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:52,844
do that to you?

391
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:05,690
No.

392
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:09,527
No, right?

393
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:11,779
He didn't, right?

394
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:15,241
Ji-hoon didn't do that.
You're telling the truth, right?

395
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,336
Then you're…

396
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:29,255
You're okay, right?

397
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:31,215
That didn't happen, right?

398
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:34,510
You're really okay, right?

399
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:40,433
What a relief.

400
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,393
Thank goodness.

401
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:44,687
Thank you, Soo-bin.

402
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:47,148
So that's not

403
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:50,902
how you got pregnant, right?

404
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:52,487
Right?

405
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:57,533
Then why did you do that, Soo-bin?

406
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,745
Why did you do that?

407
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:03,373
If you needed money,
you should have just asked for it.

408
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:07,460
Why did you have to frame Ji-hoon? Why?

409
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:10,380
And why did you blackmail
Ji-hoon's dad with a lie?

410
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:13,049
Why would you do that?

411
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:17,303
What?

412
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:19,722
Blackmail?

413
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,019
He said I blackmailed him?

414
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,689
You didn't?

415
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,276
He said you threatened
to go public with it.

416
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:37,490
I didn't blackmail him.

417
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,284
What?

418
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,371
Then…

419
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:45,248
Then are you saying he lied…

420
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:46,999
He…

421
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,252
You don't believe me, do you?

422
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:56,300
I understand.

423
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:59,595
I'm not your family or anything.

424
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:02,348
I'm just a kid you knew for a while.

425
00:32:04,642 --> 00:32:05,685
But…

426
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:09,021
I really didn't

427
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,232
blackmail him.

428
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,486
You don't have to believe anything else,

429
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,322
but I wouldn't ever

430
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:21,117
stoop that low.

431
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:52,648
He said you threatened
to go public with it.

432
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:56,903
I didn't blackmail him.

433
00:32:57,487 --> 00:33:00,490
Yes, I'm blackmailing you right now.

434
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,464
I met…

435
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,593
Soo-bin earlier.

436
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:05,846
How?

437
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:12,270
I ran into her in the afternoon.

438
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:15,106
And she

439
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:17,233
told me…

440
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:21,487
Ji-hoon didn't do that.

441
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,032
And…

442
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:29,036
she also said
she never threatened to go public.

443
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,416
Is this true?

444
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:37,587
Honey.

445
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,463
That makes no sense.

446
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,841
Do you believe what Kim Soo-bin said?

447
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:44,093
She's playing us right now.

448
00:34:44,677 --> 00:34:46,012
It's not that I believe her.

449
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:48,889
There's no reason for her
to play us like this.

450
00:34:48,973 --> 00:34:52,184
-Especially with something like this.
-Her medical records said so.

451
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:54,520
Fine.

452
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:56,397
Let's say she's telling the truth.

453
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:59,567
If she didn't blackmail me
with Ji-hoon's matter,

454
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,111
why has she been quiet
since the press conference?

455
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:04,530
Are you telling me

456
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:10,369
that I lied to you and the entire nation?

457
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:15,958
Do you really think I would

458
00:35:17,126 --> 00:35:19,670
accuse my son of being a scumbag
just to change the law?

459
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:21,505
Is that who your husband is?

460
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:40,107
I've never…

461
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:44,028
doubted you once.

462
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:48,866
But you can't trust me.

463
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:55,289
You don't need to explain anything to me.

464
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:59,543
There may be no proof or witnesses,

465
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:03,381
but I still believe you.

466
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,260
Because it's you.

467
00:36:11,597 --> 00:36:12,598
I…

468
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,101
never imagined…

469
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:17,978
you would trust someone else

470
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:22,983
more than me.

471
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:26,445
Especially not a girl like her.

472
00:36:57,852 --> 00:36:59,228
What else did she say?

473
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,022
Tell me everything she said.

474
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:06,193
Let me hear
what other lies she came up with.

475
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:14,452
What?

476
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:15,661
Nam Joong-do!

477
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:18,414
Nam Joong-do!

478
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:22,042
Nam Joong-do, you piece of shit!

479
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:24,503
I don't need these.

480
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:27,757
-How could you do this to Ji-hoon?
-Please let go of him.

481
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,216
Do you not care about your kid

482
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,218
now that you're wearing that badge?

483
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,473
Su-hyeon sacrificed her life
to give birth to Ji-hoon.

484
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:37,641
You're supposed to be his father

485
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:40,019
and you publicly ruined his reputation.

486
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:42,396
How can you call yourself his father?

487
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,482
He may have done something really bad

488
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:46,484
but he doesn't deserve this!

489
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,737
Please don't do this.

490
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,614
Stay out of this!

491
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:52,782
Honey, are you okay?

492
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,868
Leave her out of this.

493
00:37:55,951 --> 00:38:00,122
Did you just take
that woman's side in front of me

494
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:01,916
now that Su-hyeon is dead and gone?

495
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:04,001
-"That woman"?
-Su-hyeon died

496
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:07,671
without getting any treatment
to save your son.

497
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,715
She gave her life to save Ji-hoon.

498
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:12,009
Do you know what people are saying now?

499
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:16,180
That they should dig up his grave
and put an ankle monitor on him!

500
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:22,478
When you were getting remarried,

501
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:25,105
I told you to send Ji-hoon to us.

502
00:38:25,189 --> 00:38:26,690
But what did you say?

503
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:27,983
That you'd raise him well.

504
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,319
So I trusted that woman with him.

505
00:38:30,402 --> 00:38:31,737
Look where that got us!

506
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:34,323
If he didn't feel so unwelcome and lonely,

507
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:37,159
he wouldn't have become so bad!

508
00:38:39,036 --> 00:38:40,162
Goodness.

509
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,790
Goodness, Su-hyeon.

510
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,502
Poor Su-hyeon.

511
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:50,005
She must be turning in her grave!

512
00:38:57,388 --> 00:38:58,889
It's all my fault.

513
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:01,809
Ji-hoon.

514
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:04,186
What's going on with you?

515
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,313
Are your studies burdening you?

516
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:08,357
Or is someone harassing you?

517
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:11,819
You can tell me anything.

518
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:15,281
What can you do about it?

519
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:18,576
Everything sucks.

520
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:35,092
HOW TO DEAL WITH
TROUBLED TEENAGE CHILDREN

521
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:51,275
CREATING A HEALTHY
PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP

522
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:53,694
COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR TEEN

523
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:04,622
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

524
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:10,920
PUBERTY IN CHILDREN

525
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:11,921
PARENT MENTORING

526
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:12,838
WHAT'S WITH MY TEEN?

527
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:20,220
Joong-do did his best for Ji-hoon.

528
00:40:21,055 --> 00:40:23,807
If anyone's at fault, it would be me.

529
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:26,435
So please don't…

530
00:40:30,814 --> 00:40:32,066
I will accept

531
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:35,069
any criticism for what I did today.

532
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,988
But please direct it only at me.

533
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:41,241
She loved Ji-hoon more than anybody else.

534
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,702
She's Ji-hoon's mom.

535
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:25,285
Thank you

536
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,706
and I'm sorry for this afternoon.

537
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:03,574
When I accused you

538
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:09,079
of using Ji-hoon earlier today…

539
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,793
I was being unfair. I'm sorry.

540
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:20,507
You're his dad.

541
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:40,611
I'm sorry.

542
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:02,818
You're okay, right?

543
00:44:03,443 --> 00:44:05,654
That didn't happen, right?

544
00:44:05,737 --> 00:44:07,990
You're really okay, right?

545
00:44:08,574 --> 00:44:09,700
What a relief.

546
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,827
Thank goodness.

547
00:44:12,452 --> 00:44:14,037
Thank you, Soo-bin.

548
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:16,540
Did Ji-hoon…

549
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:23,839
force you in any way without your consent?

550
00:44:49,197 --> 00:44:51,992
JEONGSUN MEDICAL CENTER

551
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,578
Are you done?

552
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:55,662
Yes.

553
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:02,377
Goodness.

554
00:45:04,755 --> 00:45:06,089
I'll put these outside.

555
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:23,065
Ms. Lee, can we talk for a moment?

556
00:45:23,982 --> 00:45:24,983
Goodness.

557
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:27,861
Goodness.

558
00:45:27,945 --> 00:45:29,029
My head hurts.

559
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:33,200
Goodness, my head.

560
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,369
Jeez.

561
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,497
…he would make sure this amendment passes.

562
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,501
Assemblyman Nam
also promised to do his best

563
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:44,711
to destigmatize sex crime victims.

564
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:48,757
Under current law,
when sex offenders kill themselves…

565
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:54,680
You have seven interviews
on Namgoong Sol's Law from 13:00 today.

566
00:45:56,181 --> 00:45:57,474
And you have five tomorrow.

567
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:00,185
Sir.

568
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:03,355
You aren't wearing your badge.

569
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:07,109
Right,

570
00:46:07,192 --> 00:46:08,068
I didn't notice.

571
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:14,366
It has been an eventful couple of days.

572
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:09,671
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

573
00:47:15,677 --> 00:47:17,095
Right, the short ribs.

574
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:25,312
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

575
00:47:25,395 --> 00:47:26,813
He must have been in a hurry.

576
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:31,902
And I'm grateful that someone
who's busy as Assemblyman Nam

577
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:35,989
made time to come see her before sundown.

578
00:47:36,073 --> 00:47:39,284
But didn't he stop by late at night--

579
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:40,660
No, he didn't.

580
00:47:40,744 --> 00:47:44,748
How could I forget someone
wearing an assemblyman's badge?

581
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,710
I need to go out for a bit.

582
00:47:48,794 --> 00:47:50,045
There's a wake I have to attend.

583
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:51,713
But isn't it too late right now?

584
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:53,840
I have a tight schedule tomorrow.

585
00:47:54,716 --> 00:47:56,009
It's better to go now.

586
00:48:11,191 --> 00:48:15,195
NAM JI-HOON

587
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,167
We took several risks,

588
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:33,880
but things seem to be going
the way you intended.

589
00:48:38,844 --> 00:48:39,761
Goodbye.

590
00:48:57,696 --> 00:48:59,990
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG SOON-HONG

591
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:02,868
Hello, Assemblyman Kang.

592
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:04,661
You're calling quite early.

593
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:09,583
Sorry?

594
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,753
When Ms. Kim Soo-bin came in
and inquired about getting an abortion,

595
00:49:14,337 --> 00:49:16,840
I wrote in her chart that she got pregnant

596
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:18,550
as a result of a sexual assault.

597
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:22,679
She said the assailant was her boyfriend.

598
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:24,055
Right?

599
00:49:26,516 --> 00:49:30,145
I happened to book
the press conference hall

600
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:33,356
for 11 a.m. today.

601
00:49:34,107 --> 00:49:36,776
I'll yield it to you.

602
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,362
Why don't you use it

603
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:43,116
to announce that
the Youngsan land speculation

604
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,660
was nothing but a misunderstanding?

605
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:49,539
If you don't want to,

606
00:49:49,623 --> 00:49:52,042
I could just use it

607
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,544
to talk about your son.

608
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:09,059
INCOMING CALL

609
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,561
This is Nam Joong-do.

610
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:32,040
I wrote in her chart that she got pregnant

611
00:50:32,123 --> 00:50:33,625
as a result of a sexual assault.

612
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:37,462
She said the assailant was her boyfriend.

613
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:40,757
I only said that to the doctor

614
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:45,637
because I heard I couldn't get an abortion
unless I was a victim of a sex crime.

615
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,808
I didn't know they changed the law.

616
00:50:49,891 --> 00:50:50,725
Either way,

617
00:50:51,476 --> 00:50:53,270
that's not how I got pregnant.

618
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:54,562
Then who's the father?

619
00:50:55,855 --> 00:50:57,524
You said it wasn't sexual assault.

620
00:50:57,607 --> 00:50:59,276
Is Ji-hoon really the father?

621
00:51:03,863 --> 00:51:04,739
No.

622
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:07,659
It's my ex-boyfriend.

623
00:51:10,912 --> 00:51:12,414
What I'm saying is,

624
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:14,541
those records are

625
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,293
completely wrong.

626
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:22,966
Ji-hoon has nothing to do
with my pregnancy.

627
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:32,684
Are you insane?

628
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:35,395
You're going to hold
a press conference and say

629
00:51:35,478 --> 00:51:36,688
that Ji-hoon raped me?

630
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:39,232
You said you needed a place to stay.

631
00:51:39,316 --> 00:51:40,567
I'll handle the rest.

632
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:47,490
Ms. Kim will be hurt.

633
00:51:47,574 --> 00:51:49,784
She has nothing to do with you now.

634
00:51:50,618 --> 00:51:52,203
She was only good to you

635
00:51:52,787 --> 00:51:55,373
because she thought
you were pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby.

636
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:05,008
Okay.

637
00:52:08,636 --> 00:52:10,013
When are you going to pay me?

638
00:52:13,016 --> 00:52:15,101
I apologize from the bottom of my heart

639
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:17,854
to the victim and the citizens.

640
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:21,608
In addition, I accused
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong

641
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:24,444
of the Nation and People's Party
last month

642
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:27,113
of engaging in
land speculation in Youngsan.

643
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:34,120
I promise to get to the bottom of it

644
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:37,290
and reveal the whole truth of it soon.

645
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,125
What the…

646
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:41,544
That bastard.

647
00:52:42,128 --> 00:52:43,296
What…

648
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:45,799
This wasn't part of the plan.

649
00:52:51,012 --> 00:52:52,514
I'll feel guilty for what I did

650
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:56,935
to Hye-joo and Ji-hoon
for the rest of my life.

651
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:02,941
But I had no other choice.

652
00:53:04,984 --> 00:53:06,611
For the greater good…

653
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:09,739
and for this world.

654
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:27,424
Listen up.

655
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,427
Break your promise again,

656
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,345
and you'll lose everything
including this place.

657
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:35,598
Understand?

658
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,813
Okay.

659
00:53:46,067 --> 00:53:47,569
Kim Soo-bin will

660
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:49,404
no longer be a problem.

661
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:50,530
However…

662
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:56,035
if Ms. Kim finds out…

663
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:03,751
That won't happen.

664
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:06,838
IN APPRECIATION OF BAE GYEONG-GUK

665
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:10,216
Assemblyman Nam?

666
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,302
I think he was

667
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:14,679
the first to arrive at the wake.

668
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:16,139
Yes.

669
00:54:16,222 --> 00:54:17,932
He came around dinnertime

670
00:54:18,016 --> 00:54:20,935
but he didn't even stay for dinner
because he was busy.

671
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:25,315
My wife…

672
00:54:29,694 --> 00:54:31,613
never doubts me.

673
00:54:31,696 --> 00:54:35,700
NAM JI-HOON

674
00:54:50,048 --> 00:54:52,509
Jin Seung-ho's case will get out
today or tomorrow.

675
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:54,260
Be prepared.

676
00:54:54,844 --> 00:54:56,930
Jin Seung-hee won't sit idle

677
00:54:58,181 --> 00:54:59,641
after my press conference.

678
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:02,560
Even with the land issue aside,

679
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:05,730
she'll think that Namgoong Sol's Law
is targeted at her brother.

680
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:09,734
Yes, sir.

681
00:55:11,027 --> 00:55:13,613
There's no way to prove the truth anyway.

682
00:55:16,032 --> 00:55:17,033
Which means…

683
00:55:18,618 --> 00:55:20,453
whoever wins the public's support

684
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:24,791
will be the one telling the truth.

685
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:31,506
Right.

686
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:34,801
I think Assemblyman Nam was

687
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:38,596
the first guest after you.

688
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,600
NAM JOONG-DO, HEO JI-HYE, KIM MYEONG-JA…

689
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:44,227
Look.

690
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,772
His name is written at the very beginning.

691
00:55:49,899 --> 00:55:52,777
NAM JOONG-DO

692
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,196
-There's a wake I have to attend.
-Whose wake?

693
00:55:56,322 --> 00:55:59,200
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law passed away.

694
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:01,619
But isn't it too late right now?

695
00:56:02,203 --> 00:56:03,705
I have a tight schedule tomorrow.

696
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:05,623
It's better to go now.

697
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,507
Hello. Thank you.

698
00:56:15,174 --> 00:56:16,759
Thank you, Assemblyman Nam.

699
00:56:16,843 --> 00:56:17,802
HALL 5, NAMGOONG SOL

700
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:18,886
Just a moment.

701
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,482
Who are…

702
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:42,535
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

703
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:46,331
He came with his badge on that day.

704
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:48,625
I clearly remember seeing it.

705
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:52,337
The moment he stepped
into the funeral hall,

706
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:54,797
I recognized him

707
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:56,841
thanks to his golden badge.

708
00:56:57,425 --> 00:57:00,720
I may forget everything else,

709
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:05,266
but I'll never forget
seeing his badge on that day

710
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,936
until the day I die.

711
00:57:27,205 --> 00:57:28,873
The night Ji-hoon died,

712
00:57:35,004 --> 00:57:37,215
Mr. Nam was the last person he met.

713
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:39,467
I'll make sure

714
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,427
that you'll never be in politics again.

715
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:54,273
What about you, sir?

716
00:57:54,357 --> 00:57:55,525
Did you meet with him?

717
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:57,276
No.

718
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:53,916
TROLLEY

719
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,918
On the night of Ji-hoon's accident.

720
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:59,714
-Did you meet him?
-Assemblyman Nam kind of scared me.

721
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:02,675
I wrote all about it online.
It'll be over soon.

722
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:06,054
-On what condition?
-Oppose Namgoong Sol's Law.

723
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:08,806
Stop hanging around Ms. Kim
and just cooperate.

724
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,641
I have no choice for the greater good.

725
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:12,935
I can't trust anybody right now.

726
00:59:13,436 --> 00:59:18,316
