an accident.

You were home.

What's the matter? What is it?

<i><font color="white">Oh, right.</font></i>

27
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,138
I heard a chief advisor
was caught soliciting sex.

28
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,556
It was on the news.

29
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,558
Whose advisor was it?
Anything on the group chat?

Not yet.

31
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,063
I hope it's not anyone
from our party this time.

32
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,567
Mr. Jang, didn't you once cover
a similar case when you were a reporter?

33
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,903
Do you remember who and which party?

34
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,823
That one? It was…

-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

-Yeo-jin.
-Yes?

45
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,733
Do you think Soo-bin left
because she saw this?

46
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,989
Why else would she suddenly leave?

47
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,451
That can't be.

48
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,579
She couldn't have seen this.

49
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,791
Then why did she leave all of a sudden?

50
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,085
Yeo-jin.

51
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,088
Where do you think she is?

52
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,009
Do you think she went
to a single mothers' shelter?

53
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,514
How can I find her?
She doesn't even have a phone.

54
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,224
I…

55
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,227
I really need to find her.

56
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,273
I need to find out

57
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,859
what this is all about.

58
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,405
Get yourself together, Hye-joo.

59
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,161
Look.

60
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,955
Let's say we find her.

61
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,082
But when we do,

62
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,168
do you think you could
believe what she says?

63
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,171
I couldn't.

64
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,423
Look at this.

65
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,550
They had a rocky relationship.

66
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,385
She was scared that you'd find out.

67
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,388
Hye-joo.

68
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,016
Let's not look for her.

69
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,727
I think that'd be best for everyone.

70
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,272
They obviously had a bad breakup.

71
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,983
Who knows what she'll say
when we do find her?

72
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,322
No, Yeo-jin. She's still…

73
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:32,243
She's still the last person
that Ji-hoon talked to.

74
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,787
SOO-BIN

75
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,747
What did they talk about

76
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,791
that he suddenly--

77
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,307
Hello?

<i><font color="white">Hello, ma'am. Are you not at the studio?</font></i>

81
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,460
Mom.

82
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,547
Have you decided?

83
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,634
What will you do with the baby?

84
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,598
Mom.

85
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,021
Is that…

86
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,189
all you have to ask?

87
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,402
You acted the same way last time.

88
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,030
Do you even care about how I've been,

89
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,490
what I'm doing, or how I'm getting along?

90
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,909
Why don't you ask me those things?

91
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:56,953
Why?

92
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,584
You're pregnant?

93
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,712
Who's the father?

94
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,632
Do you not know who it is?

95
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,968
I know who the father is.

96
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,845
Hey, Mom.

97
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,181
Hi, Yun-seo.

98
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,433
Aren't you tired?

99
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,821
Ma'am.

100
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,242
Would you like a bag for 100 won?

101
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,166
Ma'am.

102
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,713
No. Just the reward points, please.

103
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,256
Here's my number.

104
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,972
Please look it up and give me my points.

105
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,225
Ma'am.

106
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,022
You forgot your purchase.

107
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,163
Your daughter shows up in 10 years
and says she's pregnant,

108
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,165
but you weren't worried at all.

109
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,084
How could you not even ask me

110
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,253
if I'm doing okay

111
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,588
or if I'm feeling sick?

112
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,382
Talk to me.

113
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,929
But that lady…

114
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,392
Do you know what she said to me
when I told her I'm pregnant?

115
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,310
By any chance, did Ji-hoon…

116
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,441
force you in any way without your consent?

117
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,527
<i><font color="white">She asked if it was consensual.</font></i>

118
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,697
That's what she asked.

119
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,949
But you…

120
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,537
I gave you my number
after I told you I was pregnant.

121
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,831
How could you not call once?

122
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,210
Did you know

123
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,338
that I kept this phone on
in case you'd call?

124
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,928
What do you want me to do?

125
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,057
To take responsibility
for leaving you as a child?

126
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,644
Or are you here to ask me
to raise your baby?

127
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,562
Is that it?

128
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,903
I'd never ask you to do that.

129
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,946
Be happy with your new daughter.

130
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,408
Was it Yun-seo?

131
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,079
How do you know her name?

132
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,665
If you ever…

133
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,295
If you ever approach her
or try to hurt her,

134
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,713
I will make you regret it.

135
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,176
Sure.

136
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,762
I don't know what I was expecting.

137
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,308
I won't bother you again.

138
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:06,935
Goodbye.

139
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,146
Soo-bin.

140
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,691
That lady you mentioned earlier.

141
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,318
Who is she?

142
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,490
Is she forcing you to do things
you don't want for money?

143
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,200
What do you take me for--

144
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,369
Then who is she?

145
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,709
She's just a lady I know.

146
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:27,223
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

147
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,600
That's why I was torn about

148
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,228
whether I should tell my mom

149
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,398
that my dad is cheating.

150
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,816
You should've told me sooner.

151
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,568
I had no idea.

152
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,279
I just thought
you were being weird lately.

153
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:43,948
Sorry.

154
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,368
I feel much better
now that I got it off my chest.

155
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,121
Stay strong.

156
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,457
Thanks.

157
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,380
I actually have a secret too.

158
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,883
What is it?

159
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,510
You can't tell anybody about this.

160
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,311
What?

161
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,563
Your brother's girlfriend
showed up pregnant?

162
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:16,981
Yes.

163
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,275
I hate that she's living with us.

164
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,904
I understand.

165
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,988
Yes.

166
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,117
But I'm better off than you, right?

167
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,953
You have it worse. I mean, an affair…

168
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,539
It's so gross.

169
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,916
It's the worst.

170
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,508
As you can see, all the ripped pages

171
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,178
have been restored,

172
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,015
and all the stained pages
have been cleaned up.

173
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,810
I hope you like it. Please take a look.

174
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,936
Okay.

175
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,687
Goodness.

176
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,773
Touch it. Isn't it so pretty?

177
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,611
It got a complete makeover.

178
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,446
-What is this?
-It's a magpie.

179
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,200
A magpie flew into my arms in my dream
when I became pregnant with you.

180
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,160
You still remember that?

181
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,580
How could I ever forget that?

182
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,209
Right. Her son is the same age as you.

183
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,505
What was his conception dream?

184
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,425
I think you may have told me,
but I can't seem to remember.

185
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,387
I can't believe how brand new this looks.
This is so incredible.

186
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,513
Right?

187
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,189
<i><font color="white">I'm nearby, so call me

189
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,365
So…

190
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,742
you can't tell Ms. Kim

191
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,204
about this.

192
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,623
Okay?

193
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,092
Thank you so much for this.

194
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,969
I'll come again.

195
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,387
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

196
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,930
-I got it.
-Okay.

197
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,599
What do you want to eat?

198
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,350
<i><font color="white">-Seolleongtang?</font></i>
-Sure.

199
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,519
-Are you okay with that?
-I love it.

200

201
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,586
Is something wrong?

202
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,713
Honey.

203
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,508
Honey.

204
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,094
Ji-hoon…

205
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,015
Honey, our Ji-hoon…

206
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,518
What's the matter?

207
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,273
Hye-joo!

208
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,486
She should try not to be
stressed out for a while.

209
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,530
Okay. Thank you.

210
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,680
-What did they say?
-She'll be okay

211
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,267
She was just really shocked.

212
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,111
I picked it up at her studio.

213
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:54,991
Thanks.

214
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll stay with her.

215
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,581
You can go on home.

216
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,749
Okay.

217
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,670
Here's her bag.

218
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,047
Let me know when she wakes up.

219
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,468
Yeo-jin.

220
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,181
Please keep it a secret from Yoon-seo.

221
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,061
About what happened today
and everything else.

222
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,191
All right. I will.

223
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,110
Thanks.

224
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,825
Hye-joo.

225
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,413
Honey.

226
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,960
Honey.

227
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,339
Ji-hoon…

228
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,719
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,100
I didn't want you to know.

230
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:52,858
<i><font color="white">Sir,</font></i>

231

<i><font color="white">please keep this a secret from my wife.</font></i>

232
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,738
Whether he fell or walked into the water,

233
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,409
it's all the same to you.

234
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,163
If she hears about this,

235
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,290
she'll be crushed.

236
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,503
<i><font color="white">So just like the autopsy report suggests,</font></i>

239
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,266
I think this could be good for us.

240
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,187
We can pin the blame for his death…

241
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,192
on that girl.

242
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,602
SEUNG-KYU'S DINING TABLE

243
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,829
We're closed for the day.

244
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,124
Excuse me.

245
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,837
Look at this.

246
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,092
I don't even know how they found
the restaurant's social media page.

247
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,095
We lost the will to live
after losing our son,

248
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,808
but we had to keep working
to make ends meet.

249
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,645
Regardless,

250
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,438
I can't believe that couple

251
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,899
both took innocent lives.

252
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:00,903
That's actually…

253
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,696
why I'm here.

254
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,617
Let's

255
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,245
work together as victims

256
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,330
and make something happen.

257
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,099
<i><font color="white">Stay safe, Soo-bin.</font></i>

258
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,602
Both you and your baby, okay?

259

<i><font color="white">I'm Ji-hoon's mom,</font></i>

260

I didn't want to see the baby.

<i><font color="white">The fetus died,

263
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,952
You can't tell Ms. Kim about this.

264
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:57,876
Hyeong-tae,

265
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,837
did the old man have good things to say?

266
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,214
I haven't reported back to him.

267
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,049
I don't know how she's
related to Nam Joong-do.

268
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,385
If I'm not thorough,
he'll give me an earful.

269
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,762
You fixed up the package
you opened, right?

270
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:12,016
Come on. That's my specialty.

271
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,272
I'm positive that I've seen her before,

272
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
but I can't put my finger on it.

273
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,359
Maybe she's a call girl.

274
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,030
I think she's the dead son's girlfriend.

275
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,073
Judging by his conduct,

276
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,827
-his girl could have been one of those.
-Don't be absurd.

277
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,788
I handpick my call girls.

278
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,373
She's not one of them.

279
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,294
Plus, I haven't seen one in a while
with the election coming up.

280
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,420
I need to be careful.

281
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:42,838
I see.

282
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,051
Right.

283
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,385
About that girl…

284
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,012
Who?

285
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,394
Other than the police,

286
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,315
does anyone else know
what really happened to Ji-hoon?

287
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,233
Woo-jae does.

288
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,570
Then honey.

289
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,783
Let's not tell Yoon-seo, okay?

290
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,911
Okay.

291
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,917
Why?

292
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,462
It was Seung-ho back then…

293
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,507
and now it's the medical student
and Ji-hoon.

294
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,217
Why does this keep happening?

295
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,764
Ji-hoon is different.

296
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,517
He's not the same.

297
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,771
He might have made his share of mistakes,

298
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,191
but he didn't die
to run from his crimes like the others.

299
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,780
So let's not torture ourselves
thinking he was like the others.

300
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,533
Okay?

301
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,708
Here.

302
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,420
There are photos of Ji-hoon in there.

303
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,591
I looked at them in the study

304
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,969
whenever I missed him.

305
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,393
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.

306
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,955
How come you haven't
talked to that assemblyman yet?

307
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,418
I won't be able to relax
until that land issue gets sorted out.

308
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,420
Mom, I'm home.

309
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,633
Why didn't you take
your husband with you today?

310
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,386
Where have you been?

311
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,389
I had some errands to run.

312
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,768
Had Seung-ho been alive,

313
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,938
he would have easily
taken care of all my headaches.

314
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:05,898
Mom.

315
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,193
What's the use of having
a daughter and a son-in-law?

316
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,944
Jeez.

317
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,285
Let's work together as victims
and make something happen.

318
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,166
They took not one, but two innocent lives.

319
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,545
Will you still let him go on
living as an assemblyman?

320
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,424
Let's talk to the press
or write something online--

321
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,550
No.

322
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,803
I just want this

323
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,430
to be over.

324
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,349
Ma'am,

325
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,185
I know how difficult it's been for you.

326
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,815
Had it not been for that assemblyman,
your son would still be alive.

327
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,902
If you stop here,
you'll regret this forever.

328
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,530
Just like my mom.

329
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,910
Actually,

330
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,621
there's a reason we want to end this.

331
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,582
We haven't told anyone,

332
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,418
but the cops told me after his funeral.

333
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,754
They said the girl

334
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,714
was a sex worker.

335
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,592
Apparently, that's how they met.

336
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,179
A sex worker?

337
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,014
It wasn't like…

338
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,184
he picked her up at a street corner.

339
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,771
She was a call girl.

340
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,233
We don't want people to find out.

341
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,278
That's why we don't want
to pursue it any further.

342
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,539
Ki-young.

343
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,793
If a victim of illegal filming

344
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,671
turned out to have been a sex worker,

345
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,717
some people would say
she brought it upon herself, right?

346
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:58,844
A sex worker?

347
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,598
I guess some people might react that way.

348
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,558
Although they shouldn't.

349
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,185
Why do you ask?

350
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,896
What?

351
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,649
No reason.

352
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,942
I was just wondering.

353
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,593
-Yeo-jin.
-Are you all right?

354
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,227
I'm fine.

355
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,402
Mom, I'm hot.

356
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,723
If you hid Ji-hoon's phone
out of concern for Hye-joo,

357
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,142
you should have deleted
those texts beforehand.

358
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,604
She showed up here the day
the police gave me the phone.

359
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,691
I thought the texts
might be useful one day.

360
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,236
One of his texts failed to send.

361
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,448
I thought I might show it to her one day.

362
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,657
Goodness.

363
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,910
Were you planning to use the
text against her?

364
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,208
I didn't feel good about it.

365
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,087
Imagine how I felt whenever
Hye-joo told me to be nice to her.

366
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,593
Just by not showing her that text,

367
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,387
I was being as generous
as I possibly could.

368
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,228
I did my best given the situation.

369
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,272
But I…

370
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,903
I didn't expect Hye-joo
to open that drawer.

371
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,656
She usually doesn't touch
my stuff in the study.

372
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,326
It was…

373
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,454
just a mistake.

374
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:13,914
Exactly.

375
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,166
If you were going to hide it,

376
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,876
you should have been more thorough.

377
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,089
What do you want me to do now?

378
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,050
Are you saying this is all my fault?

379
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,072
<i><font color="white">How's Ms. Kim doing?</font></i>

380

382
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,006
It feels so weird
to see you home at this hour.

383
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,050
-You don't like it?
-Of course I do.

384
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,553
I love it.

385
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,596
-Dad.
-Yes?

386
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,973
Are you taking the day off?

387
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,224
This is a first.

388
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:20,564
Actually, we're going to
visit your brother today.

389
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,236
I wish I could go.

390
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,574
Take me with you next time.
I miss him too.

391
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,287
All right. We'll go together next time.

392
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,957
-Hurry. You're going to be late.
-Okay.

393
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,710
Mom and Dad, I'm off to school.

394
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,045
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

395
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,818
Right.

396
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,029
My phone.

397
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:30,967
Hello?

398
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,889
Yes, this is Soo-bin's phone. Who is this?

399
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,728
Her boyfriend?

400
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,231
Are you the father of her child?

401
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,069
POOREUN EUNHA MEMORIAL PARK

402
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,408
You came together today.

403
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,169
LEE GYEONG-SUN
I MISS YOU GRANDMA. SINCERELY, JI-HOON

NAM JI-HOON

405
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,352
I said I'd be smiling
the next time I saw you.

406
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,148
I'm sorry I couldn't
keep my promise, Ji-hoon.

DRAW AND WRITE JOURNAL
NAM JOONG-DO

408

I HAD A LOOSE TOOTH.
MY MOM PULLED IT OUT USING A STRING.

TODAY IS CHILDREN'S DAY

I WANT TO BECOME A GOOD DAD

411
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,241
I WANT TO BECOME A GOOD DAD
WHEN I GROW UP

412
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,409
A good dad?

413
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,124
I completely failed to be one.

414
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,753
That's not true.

415
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,007
You've always been a good dad.

416

I'm always proud of you

Let's talk to the press
or write something online--

420
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,410
We don't want people to find out.

421
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,205
That's why we don't want
to pursue it any further.

422
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,425
CREATE A NEW POST

423
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,728
A SEX WORKER…

424
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,607
DEOKSUNG MILL

425
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:37,821
Ms. Cho.

426
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,413
People are bad-mouthing me

427
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,708
for still running the mill…

428
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,503
despite losing

429
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,297
my granddaughter.

430
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,927
But I have to support myself.

431
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,472
And I need to keep busy

432
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,851
to keep my mind off of her.

433
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,568
Was it this spring?

434
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,779
Sol told me

435
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,534
since she was making a lot of money
through her part-time job,

436
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,996
I can stop working.

437
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,040
But…

438
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,294
had I listened to her back then,

439
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,840
I don't think…

440
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,010
I could have handled all of this.

441
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:49,058
I'm sure she's in a better place now.

442
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,686
Thank you.

443
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,524
Ms. Kim, thank you so much.

444
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,779
I'm thankful that someone like you

445
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,033
came to see her off.

446
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,994
And I'm grateful that someone
who's busy as Assemblyman Nam

447
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,165
made time to come see her before sundown.

448
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,631
But didn't he stop by late at night--

449
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,049
No.

450
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:25,386
How could I forget someone
wearing an assemblyman's badge?

451
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,140
Are you in?

452
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,225
Yes.

453
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,061
Goodness. You had a guest.

454
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,979
She's a very special guest.

455
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,816
Right. Give me a moment, ma'am.

456
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,819
It's okay. I should get going now.

457
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,861
All right.

458
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,828
Do you think Assemblyman Nam is okay?

459
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,371
He even took the afternoon off.

460
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,707
To be frank,
I don't think he took enough time off

461
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,751
after what happened to his son.

462
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,922
He looks like he's completely fine,
but there's no way he is.

463
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,465
I agree.

464
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,425
He didn't have time to grieve,

465
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,636
but the aftermath can be devastating.

466
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,556
I'm worried about him.

467
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,890
And about Ms. Kim.

-What?

474

DID NAM REALLY HAVE TO EXPOSE HIM?

These comments are just fantastic.

479
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,438
The nature of the post
is quite provocative.

480
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,441
The girl everyone considered
to be the innocent victim

481
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,569
turned out to be a sex worker.

482
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,866
It doesn't change the fact
that she's a victim of a crime,

483
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,746
but it's only natural

Why would you do that?

495

He wasn't a stranger.

496
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,696
He called and said he was your boyfriend.

I don't know.

500
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,870
A girl came to pick up your phone.

501
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,457
I thought you had sent
your friend to pick it up.

Mom.

You didn't say much to the guy, did you?

Like what?

You didn't tell him

The call girl from Sangsu.

You haven't seen her in a while, right?

No. What about her?

She died? Why?

Remember that medical student
who killed himself

after Nam Joong-do called him out on TV?

553
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,328
He was also a client of hers.

554
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,207
He threatened to leak a sex video of her.

555
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,252
That's why she committed suicide.

556
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:43,843
I bet Nam Joong-do
is quite ticked off right now.

557
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,262
That's why this is the best time

558
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,016
to blackmail him with his wife's past

559

around the real estate speculation.

cover up the news

645
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,703
He's using you.

646
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,544
My granddaughter died
because of their son!

647
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:15,174
Were you that worried about his parents?

648
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:16,633
Were you?

649
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,218
Ma'am.

650
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,723
How could you betray me like this?

651
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,686
Goodness. My poor baby.

652
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,979
Ms. Cho.

653
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,234
If you were using Sol to your advantage,

654
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,905
I will not let you get away with this.

655
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,707
Stay here.

656
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,339
Ms. Cho,

657
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,966
There was no other intention
in my visit to the hospital.

658
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,471
-I simply went there as a parent who--
-Stop making excuses!

659
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,142
Leave.

660
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,604
And don't ever come back here.

661
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:12,856
Ms. Cho.

662
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:14,691
Ms. Cho.

663
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,917
Why is nothing going right?

664
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,878
Didn't I advise you
not to go to the hospital?

665
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:39,174
Everything a politician does
sends out a message.

666
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:42,845
Please do not try to explain
your intentions ever again.

667
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:46,014
Regardless of your reasons,
if the victim's family is offended,

668
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,353
you're at fault no matter what.

669
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,649
All right.

670
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,861
I get it. You can stop talking about it.

671
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,416
Is that you, Yoon-seo?

672

Come in.

673

What's the matter?

674
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,343
Are you sick?

675
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,095
Mom.

676
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,181
What's wrong?

677
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,310
Did something happen on your way home?

678
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,561
No.

679
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,855
Mom.

680
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,523
Dad…

681
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,650
Dad got…

682

684
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,373
<i><font color="white">You have no right to come here,
you murderer!</font></i>

685
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,298
I wish you'd stop using the media

686
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,342
to make a bigger issue out of this.

687
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,928
Please stop this.

688
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,388
I'm begging you.

689
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,725
Were you that worried about his parents?

690
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,768
Were you?

691
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,774
You're still up?

692
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,904
Honey.

693
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,789
I'm sorry, honey.

694
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,416
I'm sorry.

695
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,046
I had no idea what you were going through,

696
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,839
and I…

697
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,635
I'm really sorry, honey.

698
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,599
Are you okay?

699
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,685
Are you hurt anywhere?

700
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:00,023
Why didn't you tell me? I had no idea.

701
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:05,445
I see you every day
and I still didn't know.

702
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,283
I'm okay.

703
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,493
It didn't hurt at all.

704
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,704
I'm completely fine.

705
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,541
Don't cry.

706
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,751
I'm really fine.

707
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,383
What's wrong?

708
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,846
-That's where it hurts, isn't it?
-It's nothing.

709
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,222
-Let me see.
-I'm okay.

710

Hi.

716

I forget about criticism in no time.

So don't worry about me.

718

How do you do that?

719
