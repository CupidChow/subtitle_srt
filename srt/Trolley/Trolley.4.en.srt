00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,681
It's all my fault.

2
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,977
They lost their son.

6
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,160
I haven't been here for so long.

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,954
I know.

8
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,723
Do you want to go out and get some air?

9
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,517
No, let's just stay here.

10
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,065
You can work. I won't bother you.

11
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,777
It's okay. I'm not in a rush.

12
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,279
Should we just go home then?

13
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
No.

14
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,992
I just want to…

15
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,621
be here with you.

16
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,208
Feel free to work.

17
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,211
I came by to see you,
so I'll just be doing that.

18
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,798
That's all I need.

19
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,930
I'm back.

20
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,306
-Hello.
-Hello.

21
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,643
Is Assemblyman Nam all right?
What about the hospital?

22
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,270
He's fine. He's just a little tired.

23
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,980
I see. What a relief.

24
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,691
After the final inspection,

25
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,985
he'll be busy preparing
for the general election.

26
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,030
He hasn't taken a day off
since his last term,

27
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,490
so I was getting worried.

28
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,158
He hasn't had a single day off?

29
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:24,162
No, I was in charge
of his schedule back then.

30
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,790
On weekends,
he'd do rounds in his district

31
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,625
or party events around the country.

32
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,170
And on holidays, he'd visit
senior welfare centers and such.

33
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,840
So he hasn't taken a whole day off

34
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,008
for seven and a half years now.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,635
-Good grief.
-My gosh.

36
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,012
At least today's schedule was light.

37
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,476
A lot of assemblymen skip
plenary sessions around this time, right?

38
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,854
Some are busy
preparing for the inspection,

39
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,273
and others only care
about the general election.

40
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,401
They return to their districts
to secure votes.

41
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,777
That's not the case anymore.

42
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,029
The people are watching.

43
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,326
And they can keep bills pending
by keeping their seats in those sessions.

44
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,828
He's right.

45
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,414
Especially around the end
of a term, like now.

46
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,000
If a bill doesn't pass before the term,

47
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,334
it gets scrapped.

48
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,044
You're right.

49
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,714
I see, a bill can get scrapped
at the end of a term.

50
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,050
This is Assemblyman Nam's jacket.

51
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,011
-Can you get this dry-cleaned?
-Yes, sir.

52
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,347
Actually, never mind.

53
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,265
I'll go.

54
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,266
Okay.

55
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:59,508
The wake is taking place
at Kwangsun University Hospital.

56
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,470
You're not going, are you?

57
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,557
<i><font color="white">I'm sorry, but could you cancel
my schedule for the day?</font></i>

58
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,268
Mr. Jang, should I drop you off
in Yeouido?

59
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,020
No, one second.

60
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,569
KWANGSUN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

61
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,844
Let's go to Yeouido.

62
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,267
Wait, one second.

63
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,987
Ji-hoon might not be the father.

64
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,406
You're right.

65
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
He might not be.

66
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,160
How much did he pay you?

67
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,706
-What?
-How much do you charge for a night?

68
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,708
How much did Ji-hoon pay?

69
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,588
Let go of me.

70
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,547
Let go of me!

71
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,840
I said let go!

72
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,260
Pay attention when an adult
is talking to you.

73
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,312
So you haven't put out for money.

74
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,023
Ji-hoon and I dated.

75
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,274
Even so,

76
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,027
that's no guarantee
that this child is Ji-hoon's.

77
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,986
Just like you said.

78
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,990
Just cut to the chase.

79
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
Sure.

80
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,331
Are you going to stay in that house?

81
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,210
Then lay low, as if you're dead.

82
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,174
If you're not up for that,
feel free to just die.

83
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,805
Should you be saying that?

84
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,016
The dashcam is…

85
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,913
<i><font color="white">The dashcam is now connected.</font></i>

86
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,125
You're right.

87
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,169
Who knows what it'll capture?

88
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,797
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

89
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,219
<i><font color="white">An assemblyman?</font></i>

90
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,305
A list member?

91
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,601
Yes.

92
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,396
I met Assemblywoman Woo Jin-seok
from the Daehan Party last night

93
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,608
and she offered to nominate me
as a list member.

94
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,695
She even gave me a favorable slot.

95
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,746
You already made your decision.

96
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,667
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,296
But…

98
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,424
I would still…

99
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,970
like your support in this decision.

100
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,391
I've dreamt of this for a long time,

101
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,770
and I could use that reassurance.

102
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,366
I promised you when we got married

103
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,244
that even if I got into politics one day,

104
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,622
I'd make sure that
you would keep living a quiet life

105
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,083
just as you wanted.

106
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,630
I'll keep that promise at all costs.

107
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,343
I will never do anything
to break the peace in your life.

108
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,637
I promise.

109
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,108
Under one condition.

110
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,530
I know nothing about politics

111
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,075
and I probably never will.

112
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,413
So from now on, we'll be living together

113
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,415
but we'll be walking on different paths.

114
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,418
But…

115
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,047
if things ever get too hard,

116
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,634
please share it with me.

117
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,556
That's my condition
for supporting your decision.

118
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,686
I will.

119
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,938
I'll make sure I do that.

120
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,900
I promise.

121
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,534
Thank you, honey.

122
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,620
Thank you so much.

-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

127

-Yeo-jin.
-Yes?

128
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,327
Aren't you working too late?

129
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,704
Am I not allowed to?

130
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,124
Well, I wouldn't say
you're not allowed to,

131
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,710
but Hye-joo asks me
to make sure you don't work too much

132
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,004
every time she sees me.

133
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,715
This is me making sure.

134
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,885
So if you feel sick tomorrow,
it's not on me.

135
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,639
Fine, I'll leave.

Come and eat.

00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,844
Thank you for the food.

142
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,556
How can you be
so relaxed about everything?

143
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,601
Meanwhile, everyone in this family
is stressed out because of you.

144
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,605
They say being calm is good for the baby.

145
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,440
Good for the baby?

146
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,027
Do you think pregnancy is that easy?

147
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,487
Have you experienced it?

148
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,158
Are you having the baby?

I'm not sure.

150
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,044
This has gone bad.

151
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,266
It's fine.

152
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,233
It must be morning sickness.

153
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,527
Welcome.

154
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,654
May I have the name on your reservation?

155
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,322
Hey, Choi Ki-young!

156
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,824
Hey, over here!

157
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,493
Look at you.

158
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,252
Anyway, how long have you been
married to Seung-hee?

159
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,463
-Five years?
-Already?

160
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,758
Time sure flies, doesn't it?

161
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,095
It was when you were
visiting from Australia

162
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,596
that I invited you to the reunion.

163
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,098
That's when you met her.

164
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,099
Remember that?

165
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,476
I do.

166
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,561
Hold on.

167
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,021
Were you two even close in high school?

168
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,067
No, we were just in the same class
in senior year.

169
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,277
Right?

170
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,197
That's why we were surprised to hear
that you two were getting married.

171
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,992
Hey, Ki-young.

172
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,370
I played a huge part
in your marriage, okay?

173
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,705
Don't you ever forget that.

174
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,624
All right.

175
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,628
So what's with this three-year-long
language exchange program she's on?

176
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,172
Wasn't she going for a year?

177
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,176
And why didn't you go with her?
Why are you here like a widower?

178
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,305
She finished her studies
and came back today.

179
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,389
Today?

180
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,975
I wouldn't have called you if I knew that.

181
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,976
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:17,977
Right.

183
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,729
You don't have any kids yet, do you?

184
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,856
I won't ask to go for another round.

185
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,193
Go home early and have a great time,
if you know what I mean.

186
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,532
Anyway, Ki-young…

187
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,286
Can I borrow some money?

188
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,246
-Money?
-Yes.

189
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,291
I'm sorry to even ask you this,

190
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,877
but it's my work,
so could you spare 50 million?

191
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,255
I'm sorry, but I don't
have that kind of money.

192
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,426
You own so many buildings.
Of course, you have money.

193
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,136
I don't. I mean it.

194
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,430
I just manage
my mother-in-law's buildings.

195
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,516
They're all under her name.

196
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,850
Hey, same difference.

197
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,645
It'll become your wife's soon.

198
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,191
You married into
the richest family in Youngsan.

199
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,443
Don't play innocent with me.

200
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,528
Forget it.

201
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,867
Have a good night, sir.

202
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,286
-Okay.
-I'll give you a call.

203
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,666
Gosh.

204
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,461
Ms. Lee, thank you for taking the time
to write up the contract.

205
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,423
She said she'll only seal the deal
once you're in Korea,

206
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,802
so the seller and I waited
for over a month.

207
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,597
Mom, if you need someone,
you have Ki-young.

208
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,141
He manages your real estate anyway.

209
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,476
He's not my son.

210
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,021
I need to seal the deal before you

211
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:48,067
so you know where my land
and buildings are even after I'm dead.

212
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,821
Stop talking about dying.

213
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,990
Everyone dies.

214
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,298
<i><font color="white">When will you be home?</font></i>

215
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,012
Hey, you're home early.

216
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,765
Yes, I guess I am.

217
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,768
Have you had dinner?

218
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,937
I ate with Mom.

219
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,029
You must be tired. You should go to bed.

220
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,114
Okay.

221
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,687
-You're home.
-Hey.

222
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,773
I'm home too.

223
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,858
How come you two came together?

224
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,318
We met out front.

225
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,528
Are you going out again?

226
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,989
-No, I clocked out.
-What's gotten into you?

227
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,574
Yoon-seo isn't home yet, right?

228
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,284
Where's Soo-bin?

229
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,170
Come in.

230
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,383
No, stay in bed.

231
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,053
I heard you felt sick and skipped dinner.

232
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,221
Do you feel better now?

233
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,641
-Yes.
-That's a relief.

234
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,435
It can be really painful
when morning sickness gets bad.

235
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,813
I had that in the early stages
of my pregnancy too.

236
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,192
I brought some barley tea
that Yeo-jin made.

237
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,318
It should help.

238
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,739
Then get some rest.

239
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,324
Wait.

240
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,043
Here.

241
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,798
I got tested for drugs.

242
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,136
<i><font color="white">Was it really negative?</font></i>

243
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,722
I saw the test results.

244
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,895
Honey.

245
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,693
I don't know what to feel
whenever I see her.

246
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,363
I'm still quite confused
about this situation.

247
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,282
But…

248
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,827
she's pregnant with Ji-hoon's child,

249
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,122
so I'm trying my best to like her.

250
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:54,170
So just try to be
a bit more understanding, okay?

251
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,090
She even brought up
the drug test before I did

252
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,134
and got herself tested.

253
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,013
And she's having morning sickness now.
It must be hard for her.

254
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,933
Okay.

255
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,480
But honey,

256
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,941
don't get too attached to her.

257
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,737
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

258
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,615
Okay.

259
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,785
But we already let her into our house,

260
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,163
so let's just try to trust her, okay?

261
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,876
And she doesn't seem like a bad kid.

262
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,882
Do you want to take a bath?
I'll draw a bath.

263
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,720
You should. You must be tired.
It'll help you sleep.

264
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,305
Okay, thanks.

265
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,100
Where's your top?

266
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,269
What?

267
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,189
I mean your suit jacket.

268
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,858
We must have left it at the studio.

269
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,236
No, it's in my car.

270
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,779
I see.

271
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,500
Why is her bag…

272
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,793
Hey, Yoon-seo.

273
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,462
Jeez, Mom.

274
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,714
I was startled
thinking you were throwing up.

275
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,176
Soo-bin isn't feeling well.
She has morning sickness.

276
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,097
I can't believe her.

277
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,808
Watch what you say.

278
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,185
What did I do?

279
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,520
-Nam Yoon-seo.
-Nam Yoon-seo.

280
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,689
Don't talk to your mom like that.

281
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,483
Why are you always scolding me?

282
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,777
This is so annoying.

283
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,113
-Yoon-seo.
-Nam Yoon-seo!

284
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,576
She's doing that
because you keep scolding her.

285
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,119
Look at her attitude.

286
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,122
I've babied her
because there was so much going on.

287
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,165
Nam Yoon-seo, come out.

288
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,167
Stop it. I'll talk to her, okay?

289
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,379
You should go to your room.
That's enough, okay?

290
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,184
Let go of me.

291
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,185
Let go of me!

292
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,395
I said let go!

293
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,452
Don't be so hard on Yoon-seo.

294
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,704
This must be confusing
and tough for her too.

295
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,539
I'll talk to her.

296
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,295
It's not just about today.

297
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,173
Being a good student isn't everything.

298
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,260
Yoon-seo is in middle school, honey.
She's an adolescent.

299
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,764
And she's been through a lot.

300
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,561
Your daughter is kind
and brilliant just like you

301
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,231
and I couldn't be more proud of her.

302
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,278
I've stayed the closest
to Yoon-seo for the last eight years,

303
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,488
so I can vouch for it.

304
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,450
Are you scolding me
for making you raise her alone?

305
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,495
You catch on quick.

306
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,955
You're a smart one, aren't you?

307
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,416
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,003
I have no excuses.

309
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,257
You know that…

310
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,262
I gave you up to share
with the world, right?

311
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,600
I do.

312
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,688
Thank you.

313
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,816
I love you.

314
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,152
Me too.

315
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,989
I love you too.

316
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,106
JIN SUSHI

317
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,760
Good morning.

318
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,355
You got ready so early.

319
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,774
One second.
I have to bottle the vegetable juice.

320
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,819
Take your time.
I'll be putting my shoes on.

321
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,456
<i><font color="white">First off, I made a round in Youngsan.</font></i>

322

Lee Yoo-sin's family, that is,
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong's in-laws,

323
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,130
have been community leaders
in this area for generations.

324
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,424
No one around here is willing to talk.

325
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,554
Nonetheless, I did find
a new piece of information.

326
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,558
<i><font color="white">Lee Yoo-sin doesn't approve
of her son-in-law.</font></i>

327
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,518
Her son-in-law?

328
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,145
The one who manages her real estate?

329
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,815
Yes, his name is Choi Ki-young,

330
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,733
<i><font color="white">and he runs an indoor driving range.</font></i>

331
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,068
<i><font color="white">Is he a local?</font></i>

332
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,821
Yes, he met Lee Yoo-sin's daughter

333
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,198
<i><font color="white">at a high school reunion
before he married her.</font></i>

334
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,951
They live in
Lee Yoo-sin's home to this day.

335
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,663
<i><font color="white">Also, Lee Yoo-sin's daughter
went to Canada alone about three years ago</font></i>

336
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,041
<i><font color="white">to study abroad, then returned recently.</font></i>

337
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,044
Leaving her husband
with her mom who disapproves of him?

338
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,630
<i><font color="white">Yes.</font></i>

339
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,341
I see. What an interesting couple.

340
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:01,221
But if her son-in-law is in charge of
managing her real estate,

341
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,140
it means she trusts him.

342
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,350
So why does she disapprove of him?

343
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,602
Well, apparently…

344
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,730
his family isn't very wealthy.

345
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,483
<i><font color="white">They weren't well-off to begin with,</font></i>

346
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,696
<i><font color="white">so Lee Yoo-sin gifted him
the driving range when they got married.</font></i>

347
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,156
FROM MOTHER-IN-LAW LEE YOO-SIN

348
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,827
<i><font color="white">She drags him around
and walks all over him.</font></i>

349
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,873
<i><font color="white">-So people are reluctant to talk,</font></i>
-Not from there. What are you doing?

350
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,666
<i><font color="white">but they all feel bad for him.</font></i>

351
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,209
Get a good angle. Good.

352
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,005
If she left her husband alone
to go overseas

353
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,423
in spite of all that,

354
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,300
the couple may not be on good terms.

355
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,469
Did she return to finalize their divorce?

356
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,723
You can't find out
what's going on between a couple.

357
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:49,561
Right, but the word about Choi Ki-young
and his mother-in-law seems to check out,

358
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,647
so why don't we talk to him?

359
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,983
<i><font color="white">If everyone else could see
how much she belittles him,</font></i>

360
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,735
<i><font color="white">I'm sure he's got a lot bottled up.</font></i>

361
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,447
Right, and if he's managing
her real estate, he'll have information--

362
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,283
No, let's not mess with the son-in-law.

363
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,286
Things may be bad between them,
but they're family.

364
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,456
They'd have each other's backs
through worse things.

365
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,793
But he's just an in-law.

366
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,420
Family is more than just blood.

367
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,675
And if he's staying in that marriage

368
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,677
despite all the public mistreatment,

369
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,554
it could speak to how much
he loves his wife.

370
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,348
I see.

371
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,267
Love is so difficult.

372
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,310
Do you think that's
why I'm not married yet?

373
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,020
-Precisely.
-Darn it.

374
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,647
-Ms. Kim.
<i><font color="white">-Yes, sir.</font></i>

375
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,440
I know you're working hard,

376
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,861
but can you find a different approach
not involving the son-in-law?

377
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,030
<i><font color="white">-Yes, sir.</font></i>
-Okay, good work.

378
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,287
Hey, it's me. Can you talk right now?

379
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,708
You were in a delivery? You must be busy.

380
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,546
Actually, I called to ask something.

381
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,758
I hear there's a medicine
for morning sickness these days.

382
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,761
What?

383
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,557
It's not for me. That's nonsense.

384
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,271
About five weeks now.

385
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,900
I see.

386
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,113
Okay, you should get back to work.

387
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,906
Yes, okay. Thank you.

388
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,093
I LOVE YOU, MOM AND DAD.
SINCERELY, NAM JI-HOON

389
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,359
Darn it, where's my lip balm?

390
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,072
I got it back from her
and then put it in here.

391
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,492
Did I drop it somewhere?

392
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,917
MS. KIM

393
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,922
I'll ask her later tonight.

394
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,174
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

395
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,803
Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok will come by
during the campaign, right?

396
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,015
I really hope she does.

397
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,435
She was of great help
during the last general election.

398
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,812
I know that very well.

399
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,024
And Assemblyman Nam.

400
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,654
You need to be more active
in making contact with local residents.

401
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,949
Sure, I'll make more time.

402
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,454
I wasn't talking about you.

403
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,164
I meant Ms. Kim.

404
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,586
I didn't want to bring this up again,

405
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,881
but as the chief of the district office

406
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,050
and the chief of your election campaign,

407
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,637
frankly, I'm very disappointed
in your wife.

408
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,722
I said it.

409
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,601
Other assemblymen have their wives

410
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,312
visit local residents
to secure their votes,

411
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,232
but Ms. Kim never participates.

412
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,317
I mean, okay.

413
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,154
I can understand that to a certain extent.

414
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:30,490
But she has to come out
during the elections.

415
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:35,662
Honestly, it's very discouraging.

416
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,746
And no,

417
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,208
we may not be your family.

418
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,544
But we work day and night for months,

419
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,505
taking IV fluids
and breaking our backs for you.

420
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,341
But your wife doesn't even show up

421
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,552
and doesn't seem to care at all.

422
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,638
We can't help but get discouraged.

423
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,443
I completely understand what you mean.

424
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,572
However…

425
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,074
I'm sorry.

426
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,701
I don't think…

427
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,454
my wife can help.

428
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,428
I'm so sorry, Mr. Yoo.

429
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,263
Wait, Assemblyman Nam.

430
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,641
Goodness.

431
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,103
I'll put in the extra effort
to make up for her absence.

432
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,815
So please do understand.

433
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:51,279
That's a promise I made to my wife.

434
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,032
I'm sorry.

435
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,537
Goodness, Assemblyman Nam.
Please don't do this.

436
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,288
Assemblyman Nam. Please.

437
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,638
SINYANG-GU'S SON!
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER!

438
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,599
Why is a flier from
the last general election here?

439
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,894
I was so young.

440
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,273
Time flies.

441
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,316
I worked so hard back then.

442
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,115
Assemblyman Nam.

443
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,660
Why did you want to get into politics?

444
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,996
That was out of nowhere.

445
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,460
I wanted the world
to change for the better.

446
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,174
Having said it out loud,
it sounds like a kid's journal entry.

447
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,178
But it's true.

448
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,600
That's what I wrote when they asked me
what I wanted to be and why

449
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,643
back when I was young.

450
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,774
In that case,

451
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,653
if you had to choose

452
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,325
between the world you dream of
and your wife,

453
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,954
which one would you choose?

454
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,952
Honey.

455
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,329
Hey, honey.

456
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,123
-Were you on your way home?
-No.

457
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,335
Is something wrong?

458
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,544
No, everything is fine.

459
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,130
I was just at the district office.

460
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,966
The main street was jammed,
so we took a detour and saw you.

461
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,301
I see.

462
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,929
-Were you on your way home?
-Yes. Have you had dinner?

463
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,264
I'm on my way to a dinner engagement.

464
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,433
-Don't drink too much.
-Yes, ma'am.

465
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,853
Hello.

466
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,063
-Hello.
-Hello.

467
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,690
Thank you for your hard work.

468
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,316
Go on.

469
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,984
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

470
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,830
There.

471
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,000
What's wrong?

472
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,919
It's nothing. You should go.

473
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:53,837
Goodbye.

474
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,588
-See you later.
-Bye.

475
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,733
I'd like to hear the answer
to my question before.

476
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,239
Do you choose your wife?

477
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,661
What makes you think
I can only have one of the two?

478
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,422
Don't get too attached to her.

479
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,382
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

480
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,427
You've barely touched your food.

481
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,346
-Is it bad?
-No, it's not that.

482
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,681
I just don't have an appetite.

483
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,267
Good grief.

484
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,644
One has morning sickness
and the other has no appetite.

485
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,772
Give me a role too, will you?

486
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,735
What is it?

487
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:00,695
Is something wrong?

488
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,532
It's nothing.

489
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,684
Come in.

490
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,692
Are you coming back from work?

491
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,277
Yes.

492
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,115
What is it?

493
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,492
Well,

494
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,828
about your lip balm…

495
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,664
The one with sticker residue.

496
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,999
Yes, it was at your studio, right?

497
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,587
No, I didn't see it around.

498
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,922
It wasn't there?

499
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,217
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.

500
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,139
Could you take another look
when you get to work tomorrow?

501
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,394
Sure. I'll do that.

502
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,520
Thank you.

503
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,523
But what did you want to say about it?

504
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,277
-Right.
-If you didn't find it,

505
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,903
what was it about?

506
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,867
I wanted to ask you
about the name of the color.

507
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,243
The name of the color?

508
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,329
It was pretty,
so I wanted to get one for Yoon-seo.

509
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,417
Right.

510
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,670
There's a lot of them in the shop,

511
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,922
so you just pick one out.

512
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,966
I see.

513
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,261
-Thank you.
-Sure.

514
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,535
Lucky her.

515
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,005
Hey, you're home.

516
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,257
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

517
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,052
No, I wasn't asleep. I couldn't sleep.

518
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,678
Why not?

519
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,472
Just because.

520
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,100
You're late. You said
you'd be home around midnight.

521
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,479
I had dinner with the district delegates,

522
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,315
and one of the entourage
hit a car while pulling out theirs.

523
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,859
So I drove them home in my car.

524
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,112
Back to their home? Who?

525
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,323
You wouldn't know them.

526
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,034
It was Delegate Song Yu-jin.

527
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,828
Wait a second.

528
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,164
How come you're suddenly interested in me?

529
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,999
-What?
-Think about it.

530
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,963
You never showed any interest
in who I meet and what I do.

531
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,340
But now you're asking who I was with

532
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,342
and asking if I took them home.

533
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,468
That's…

534
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,388
making my heart race.

535
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,558
Dream on.

536
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,478
I do not care at all
about Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

537
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,479
Wash up and sleep.

538
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,440
I like it. Give me some attention.

539
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,359
Stop it. You need to wash up.

540
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,945
-Goodnight.
-Okay.

541
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,201
-Actually, honey.
-Yes?

542
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,123
-Do you usually have…
-Yes?

543
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,960
other people in your car
besides you and Woo-jae?

544
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,003
Other people?

545
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,088
Yes.

546
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,589
Well, I guess so.

547
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,094
Other than Mr. Jang,
I usually take Ms. Kim

548
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,681
to the district offices
or to events outside of the office.

549
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,891
I see, Ms. Kim too?

550
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,309
Yes, usually.

551
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,439
Pretty much everyone from the office.
Ko Min-seok, Choi Ja-young, everyone.

552
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,983
-Why do you ask?
-What?

553
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,027
It's nothing.

554
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,112
You must be tired. Go wash up.

555
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,115
-Okay, goodnight.
-Goodnight.

556
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,791
My heart's still racing.

557
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,171
What is wrong with you?

558
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,054
I must have been mad.

559
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,548
Oh, right.

560
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,508
Are you still in touch
with anybody in Youngsan?

561
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:39,927
-Youngsan?
-Yes.

562
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,929
Why all of a sudden?

563
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,558
I've been doing something
and Youngsan came up.

564
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,102
It's your hometown,
so I was wondering if you knew anyone.

565
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,770
I see.

566
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,773
I've been away for so long,

567
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,359
so I've lost touch with friends
from the children's home or school.

568
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,571
That's what I thought.
I was asking just in case.

569
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,906
-Sure.
-I'll go now.

570
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,240
-Take this.
-Right.

571
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,995
-Have a great day.
-You too.

572
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,038
Thanks.

573
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,106
NAM JOONG-DO, YOUNGSAN

574
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,984
KANG'S IN-LAW SUSPECTED OF
LAND SPECULATION IN YOUNGSAN

575
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,364
NAM'S PRESS CONFERENCE
ON SPECULATION CONTROVERSY

576
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,326
"Lee"?

577
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,245
Lee…

578
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,875
I can't think of anyone.

579
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,447
Assemblyman Kang.

580
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,032
Yes?

581
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,618
Oh, Yoo-sin.

582
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,537
Hello, Soon-hong.

583
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,456
That assemblyman's secretary or whatever

584
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,792
came down to stir things up.

585
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,877
I mean, that's all fine.

586
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:42,717
But she keeps snooping around
and harassing these busy people.

587
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,385
Yes, right.

588
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,513
So I told them to warn her
that they'll report her

589
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,017
for obstruction of business
if she ever visits them again…

590
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,934
What?

591
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,563
It's not like you did anything illegal.

592
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,859
Your late mother told you
to buy some land in a dream,

593
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,569
so you bought some.

594
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,488
And it just happened
to become a development site.

595
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,161
Yes, there's nothing to worry about.

596
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,787
Okay, Soon-hong.

597
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,123
Goodbye, then.

598
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,291
Okay.

599
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,710
Darn it.

600
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,879
What did he say?

601
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:24,341
He told me not to worry
since it was just a baseless accusation.

602
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,970
It's easy for him to say
when he's all the way in Yeouido.

603
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,889
Good grief.

604
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,601
I'm so annoyed about that secretary
snooping around the neighborhood.

605
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,312
Goodness.

606
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,732
Just because I have family in Yeouido,

607
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,318
they're coming all the way down
to this rural town

608
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,071
to dig up dirt on me
just for buying some land

609
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,239
when I'm just a hard-working woman.

610
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:51,327
This is a serious case of defamation
and a violation of my human rights.

611
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,620
What's going on?

612
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,165
I just managed to fall asleep
because of my jet lag.

613
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,544
What's going on?

614
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,296
Is something wrong?

615
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,006
It's none of your concern.

616
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,760
Soon-hong is right.

617
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,347
They don't have the money
or the connections for investment

618
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,641
and call it speculation
because they're jealous.

619
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,726
Good grief, this is unbelievable.

620
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,522
-Ki-young.
-Yes?

621
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,024
You need to silence that assemblyman.

622
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,653
Say we'll report him for spreading
false information and defamation.

623
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:32,993
Why haven't you done
anything to prevent this?

624
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,954
Why are you yelling at Ki-young?

625
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,249
Why do you think?
He can't even do his job right.

626
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:39,959
You're late. Let's go.

627
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,295
You aren't late!

628
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,047
She's always siding with him.

629
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,050
Yes, I see.

630
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,428
Then please send me a photo
of that secretary's business card.

631
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,431
Okay, thank you.

632
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,604
-Is he an assemblyman around here?
-No, in Seoul. He's with the Daehan Party.

633
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,565
I see, the Daehan Party.

634
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,733
Your mom bought that land

635
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:08,487
because Uncle Soon-hong told her
that it'll be developed soon.

636
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,739
It was announced soon after,

637
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,075
and the land tripled in value
over six months.

638
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,704
So what do we do now?

639
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,292
What do you mean?
She told me to take care of it.

640
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,502
And how will you do that?

641
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,504
Don't get yourself involved.
Just stay put.

642
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,090
How will staying put get anything done?

643
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:33,429
Ki-young, I know that
this is tough for you,

644
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,307
but you know why my mom
is so obsessed with real estate.

645
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,934
-I know it's tough, but--
-Seung-hee.

646

I'll do whatever I can
to figure out this issue.

647
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,107
But…

648
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,234
I can't keep doing this.

649

LEGISLATION AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
CONFERENCE ROOM

712
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,935
This is preposterous.

713
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,606
This bill proposed and represented
by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do

714
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,275
is framing innocent people
as potential economic criminals

715
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:24,112
just for having politicians
in their families.

716
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,619
First, you make accusations about me
and my family without any evidence.

717
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,747
And now this?

718
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:38,085
What's lacking is your conscience,
not the evidence.

719
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,046
Watch yourself, Assemblyman Nam!

720
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,216
Were you really unaware that
your sister-in-law bought land last year

721
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,636
that was recently announced
for development by the MOLIT?

722
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,973
Assemblyman Nam.

723
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,809
Do you know every little economic activity

724
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,520
conducted by every single relative?

725
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,730
I would say a sister-in-law
is close family.

726
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,735
In that case,
you must have been well aware

727
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,488
of your son's economic activities

728
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,617
since he's your direct family.

729
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,787
I'm talking about the meth!

730
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,588
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong.

731
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,007
You've crossed the line.

732
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,133
How so?

733
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,261
This is just a fact supported by evidence!

734
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,807
Marijuana would be bad enough, but meth?

735
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,435
He was a junkie.

736
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,103
Watch your words!

737
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,480
Assemblymen,

738
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,691
please refrain from digressing--

739
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,735
What I'm saying is,

740
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:51,283
don't try to pass a bill like this
and insult politicians and their families!

741
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,634
Since there isn't anyone
that can continue the debate in his place,

742
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,385
we have to move on to the voting.

743
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,638
But since Assemblyman Kang
has left the room,

744
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,682
we don't have a quorum
for a vote at the moment.

745
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,518
Therefore, we'll have to take a vote

746
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,271
on another day when the situation allows.

747
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,068
Next bill.

748
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,780
