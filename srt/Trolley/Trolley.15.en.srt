1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,078
Hello.

2
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,165
I am Kim Hye-joo,

3
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,750
the wife of Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party.

4
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,765
Tell me everything
that you've lied to me about.

5
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,392
Don't leave anything out.

6
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:36,895
And I mean anything.

7
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,565
And I'm not forgiving you for any of it.

8
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:44,360
There's nothing else.

9
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:47,822
Are you sure?

10
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:57,665
Twenty years ago,

11
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,710
I was molested

12
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,712
by a boy I went to school with.

13
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,343
I reported it to the police,

14
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,264
but the assailant
immediately took his own life,

15
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,141
and the case was closed

16
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:19,229
without further investigation
as there was no one to indict.

17
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:22,398
"Molested"? This is ridiculous.

18
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,152
As a result, I lost my chance
to reveal the truth of the incident.

19
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:31,491
I ended up having to leave my hometown
as I was falsely accused of lying…

20
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,285
and driving the boy to his death.

21
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:36,871
She came to our house

22
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,707
and demanded settlement money
for her alleged molestation.

23
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,463
The claim that I lied about being molested
for money is completely untrue.

24
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:49,801
I see. I would like to ask
Assemblyman Nam a question.

25
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:52,720
You proposed an amendment
to the Criminal Act

26
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:55,223
that you named "Namgoong Sol's Law".

27
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:58,476
But ironically enough,

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,730
your son was an assailant of a sex crime
who died shortly after his offense,

29
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,983
bringing his investigation

30
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,318
to an end.

31
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,028
Am I right?

32
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,239
Yes, that's correct.

33
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:17,745
Yes.

34
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,622
It's true.

35
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:22,333
The anchor will bring up Ji-hoon.

36
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,336
She'll point out
that I proposed Namgoong Sol's Law

37
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,464
when my own son is a sex offender.

38
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,259
But Ji-hoon is innocent.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,971
And do you have to
mention that bill today?

40
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,391
Talking about Ji-hoon

41
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,103
will be the most effective way
to appeal my sincerity

42
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:43,479
to the public.

43
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,775
I'll make sure the bill gets passed

44
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:50,486
so that no one will suffer like you did.

45
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,989
Isn't that what you want as well?

46
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:56,659
Even though

47
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:00,371
he put me through much emotional pain,

48
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:03,708
I can swear that I never wished
for him to take his own life.

49
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,004
Not even for a moment.

50
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,673
When he took his own life,

51
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,092
it turned my life completely upside down.

52
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,596
Even if Namgoong Sol's Law gets passed,

53
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,724
my case will not be revisited.

54
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,518
However,

55
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:26,773
I mustered up all the courage I had
to come out here today

56
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:31,694
in hopes that there won't be
any more victims like me.

57
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,449
For a very long time, I thought

58
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:39,952
that I shouldn't have reported him
to the police back then.

59
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,040
I was filled with regret.

60
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,921
But thanks to my husband,

61
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:53,841
I am now convinced
that I would do the same thing

62
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,388
even if I were to go back in time.

63
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:01,516
I will…

64
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,018
never…

65
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,105
run away again.

66
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:27,834
THE TRUTH

67
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,175
I'm going to see a lawyer tomorrow.

68
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,094
We can sort out our divorce through them.

69
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,013
Don't take off your ring.

70
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,602
You and Namgoong Sol's Law
have just become

71
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,979
the center of attention.

72
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,189
So not just yet.

73
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,152
How can you be so shameless?

74
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,237
The bill needs to pass
before the election.

75
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,489
If it doesn't,

76
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,867
it'll be discarded when my term is over.

77
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:03,828
We can't get divorced until then.

78
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,873
Shall we go, sir?

79
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,166
One minute.

80
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,254
We need a moment to talk.

81
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:29,353
THIS IS OCY REPORTER LEE JEONG-JI.
ARE YOU AVAILABLE FOR AN INTERVIEW?

82
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:35,776
REPORTER KWON IL-RYUL, QTBC
REPORTER LEE YONG-I, YTE

83
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,406
YEO-JIN

84
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,668
YEO-JIN

85
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:55,671
What is it?

86
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:01,552
Yes, that's me.

87
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:05,139
Jeongsun Medical Center?

88
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:10,811
What?

89
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,313
Suicide?

90
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:18,444
Yeo-jin.

91
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:22,698
Yeo-jin.

92
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,534
Yeo-jin.

93
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,245
Yeo-jin.

94
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,372
Yeo-jin.

95
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:32,583
Are you Ms. Hyeon Yeo-jin's guardians?

96
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,043
-Yes.
-Yes.

97
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,419
How is she?

98
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,421
She was brought here in time,

99
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,465
so her life's not in danger.

100
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:42,969
What happened?

101
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:45,930
She overdosed on sleeping pills
and fainted at her restaurant.

102
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,935
A regular was passing by
when they found her unconscious.

103
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:53,813
So what now?

104
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,358
She needs to be hospitalized
until she wakes up.

105
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,945
But we only have
private wards available now,

106
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:02,780
so she'll stay in the emergency room.

107
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,824
Take her to a private ward.

108
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,242
Pardon?

109
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,243
Please do that.

110
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,579
Okay. One minute, please.

111
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:11,831
I'll be going now.

112
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:12,832
Thank you.

113
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,797
I'll stay here. You can go.

114
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:22,466
-What?
-Honey.

115
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,302
Isn't that our district's assemblyman?

116
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:26,596
You're right.

117
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,222
It's Nam Joong-do.

118
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,432
-Right?
-Yes.

119
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,893
I just saw him on the news.

120
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:32,935
-You did?
-Yes.

121
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,064
Do you want to shack up with her?

122
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:41,068
Do it after we're divorced.
For now, just leave.

123
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,406
Okay.

124
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,075
I'll call you.

125
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:51,996
Don't let Yoon-seo know.

126
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,540
About any of this.

127
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,208
Ever.

128
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:00,796
Okay.

129
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:19,857
But ironically enough,

130
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:23,903
your son was an assailant of a sex crime
who died shortly after his offense,

131
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:28,783
bringing his investigation to an end.

132
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:30,618
Am I right?

133
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,286
Yes, that's correct.

134
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:37,750
INTERVIEW WITH ASSEMBLYMAN
NAM JOONG-DO'S WIFE

135
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,834
Yes.

136
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,087
It's true.

137
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,927
You're going on the news with him today?

138
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:51,597
How can you do that
after finding out about his affair?

139
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:57,144
This is the only way right now

140
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,940
to reveal the truth to the world.

141
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,108
But still.

142
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,381
I watched it.

143
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,176
The dashcam footage of Ji-hoon.

144
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,513
I don't blame you.

145
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,934
I'm sorry for doubting you.

146
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,732
And I'm sorry for letting you down.

147
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,863
It's fine, sir.

148
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:27,234
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

149
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,658
Congratulations, Ji-hoon.

150
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,077
I didn't think you'd make it.

151
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:38,162
I can't miss this.

152
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:40,790
Guess what, Dad?
Mom is taking us out for jjajangmyeon.

153
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,000
It's your lucky day.

154
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,085
What happened?
I thought you couldn't come.

155
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,462
Can you have lunch with us?

156
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,464
No, I have to get back. I just dropped by.

157
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:05,564
YOON-SEO

158
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:15,783
Hey, Yoon-seo.

159
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,243
Are you back from your classes?

160
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:18,744
Yes, I just got home.

161
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,330
Mom, I saw the news.

162
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,457
Everyone's rooting for you now.

163
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,918
I'm so relieved.

164
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,879
By the way, where's Auntie Yeo-jin?

165
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,214
She isn't home.

166
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,176
She's out of town?

167
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,302
Yes.

168
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,473
So make sure to lock up, okay?

169
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:40,724
I'm sorry

170
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:45,271
for thinking you were lying the other day.

171
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,358
Mom.

172
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,277
Stay strong.

173
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,737
I love you.

174
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,031
Thanks, Yoon-seo.

175
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,743
You know I love you very much, right?

176
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:00,911
Good night.

177
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:15,593
POWER OFF

178
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,892
Kim Jae-eun is lying.

179
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:26,228
I want you to interview
her and me together.

180
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:50,419
-The National Assembly is observing
-Signatures are being gathered

181
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:53,339
-the public's response to the bill.
-throughout Seoul in support of the bill.

182
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:56,300
-Daehan Sex Crime Victim Support Center…
-Heated debates are going on…

183
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,678
Thank you for supporting
Namgoong Sol's Law.

184
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:02,222
I will relay your message
to Assemblyman Nam.

185
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:03,641
Thank you.

186
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:04,642
Bit-na.

187
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,061
This was Gangnam Station this morning.

188
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,105
Petitions are being signed
all over the city.

189
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,523
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

190
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:15,027
The donations for Assemblyman Nam
just reached the annual limit.

191
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,154
-We got 60 million won just today.
-What?

192
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:18,447
No way.

193
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,823
I can't believe it.

194
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,623
Thank you for interviewing with us, sir.

195
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,541
Thank you. Take care.

196
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,834
See you another time.

197
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,046
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

198
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:37,591
Hello, sir.

199
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,260
Reporter Shin Jae-hui
from Daeho Daily, right?

200
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:41,887
-Yes, that's me.
-Nice to meet you.

201
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,639
Please come on in.

202
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,598
This way, please.

203
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,728
The public sentiment is
in support of Namgoong Sol's Law.

204
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:51,855
Shouldn't we show support as well?

205
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:55,276
No. It was an arbitrary decision
by Assemblyman Nam

206
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,987
made without any discussion
with the party at all.

207
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,073
We don't even know if the bill
will pass the committee's review

208
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:03,325
with the juridical issues it entails.

209
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,327
We need a cause if we're going to

210
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,121
support it as a party.

211
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,540
Public sentiment is
the only cause we need.

212
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:13,460
He completely excluded the party
from his decision.

213
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:15,421
That's just a lack of discipline.

214
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,674
You left these clothes
in the car yesterday.

215
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,801
Thank you.

216
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:25,848
You must feel uncomfortable
being with her.

217
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:28,350
I'll stay with her.

218
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,060
You can talk when she wakes up.

219
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,521
You should go home for now.

220
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,108
Were you aware of their relationship?

221
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:41,739
Yes.

222
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:48,537
I had forgotten.

223
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,747
For you, Woo-jae…

224
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:54,835
I mean, Mr. Jang,
my husband always comes first.

225
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,297
How long have you known?

226
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,342
Was I the only one in the dark?

227
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,016
I'll stay here.

228
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,448
Nam Joong-do is
our district's assemblyman.

229
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,618
Hey, I saw him
in the emergency room yesterday.

230
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,620
-Really?
-Yes.

231
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:33,165
This is the only big hospital in the
neighborhood after all.

232
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:34,750
I wonder why he was here though.

233
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,460
No idea.

234
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:43,300
Your dad was amazing on TV yesterday.

235
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:45,761
Your mom has cleared her name too.

236
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,012
This is so great.

237
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:50,057
But her brother is still a sex offender.

238
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,226
I'd be too humiliated to come to school.

239
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,938
Hey, shouldn't you drop out?

240
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:59,400
Hey, that's enough.
It's not like she did anything wrong.

241
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,152
Do you want to be called
to the disciplinary committee?

242
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:05,197
Why are you always bringing up
the committee? You snitch.

243
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,157
That's right.

244
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:11,036
Nam Joong-do's son molested me
dozens of times.

245
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:13,539
But Nam Joong-do made it

246
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:16,625
sound like it was just once.

247
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:21,547
Jeez. He deserved to die.

248
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,134
Right. I heard his son was a meth addict.

249
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,636
Did he force it on you too, by any chance?

250
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,140
Of course he did.

251
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:35,018
He tried to make me use it too.

252
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,019
You're lying.

253
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:41,066
Ms. Kim, this isn't right.

254
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,737
MS. KIM

255
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:53,078
The phone is turned off.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

256
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,893
JICHEONG JEIL REAL ESTATE

257
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,024
The lady from the other day
wants to buy your restaurant.

258
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,150
Please give me a call.

259
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,530
I'll call the doctor.

260
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:11,949
No, Hye-joo.

261
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,910
I'm okay.

262
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,248
The realtor called.

263
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:23,919
Were you going to sell
the restaurant and flee

264
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,546
before I found out about you two?

265
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,174
Did you take the pills
because you got caught?

266
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:36,098
You know how much I suffered
because of what happened in the past.

267
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,766
How could you do this?

268
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,769
Did you hate me that much?

269
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,940
Did you want to make me suffer
even after you died?

270
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,694
I am

271
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:52,030
really mad at you,

272
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,824
but I never wanted you to die.

273
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:58,412
Don't you feel bad about it at all?

274
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:01,790
You couldn't do this if you do!

275
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:03,208
I'm sorry, Hye-joo.

276
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,007
I lied.

277
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,804
What else have you not told me?

278
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:20,267
I thought I was saving you
from bigger pain.

279
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:23,729
Cut the crap.

280
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,481
Just cut to the chase.

281
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,443
Nam Joong-do…

282
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:35,032
He…

283
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,535
raped me.

284
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,926
You're out of your mind.

285
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:06,104
JI-HOON'S GRADUATION

286
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,920
Don't come any closer.

287
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:32,547
I'm going to call the police.

288
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:41,932
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:44,893
I made a mistake.

290
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,690
Please forgive me.

291
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:51,191
"A mistake"?

292
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,069
You call that a mistake?

293
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:56,738
How can you call yourself human?

294
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:59,366
How could you…

295
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,284
How could you do that to me?

296
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,912
Please forgive me this once.

297
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,164
It will never happen again. I promise.

298
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,166
So…

299
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,379
please forget about…

300
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:15,465
what happened last night.

301
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,719
I truly regret it.

302
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,890
I will become a better assemblyman

303
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:26,435
and make up for what I've done.

304
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,646
Do you even hear yourself?

305
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,191
If Hye-joo finds out,

306
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:36,403
she won't be able to handle it.

307
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,072
Please, Yeo-jin.

308
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:46,872
How could you use Hye-joo as an excuse?

309
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,011
Yeo-jin.

310
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:04,556
Are you still feeling unwell?

311
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,604
I'll leave your medicine outside the door.

312
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:12,481
Take it and get better soon, okay?

313
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,460
COLD MEDICINE

314
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,178
Yeo-jin, are you sleeping?

315
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,808
I'm about to go to bed.

316
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:52,312
You've been sick for so long.

317
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:55,190
I made a doctor's appointment
for tomorrow. Let's go together.

318
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:57,526
Okay.

319
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,988
And I made some seaweed soup.

320
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:04,908
Tomorrow is Chae-eun's birthday.

321
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,998
Please give this to Chae-eun.

322
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:13,333
From Ji-hoon's mom.

323
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,841
Let's go together tomorrow.

324
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,137
Okay.

325
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,348
Good night.

326
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,100
Rest up.

327
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:53,039
That's the day I decided

328
00:23:54,874 --> 00:23:56,084
to forget everything

329
00:23:57,877 --> 00:23:59,421
and move on.

330
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,449
Yeo-jin, you're up.

331
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,492
Give me a second, honey. I'm almost done.

332
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:30,535
Take your time.

333
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:34,623
Are you going to work?

334
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,542
Yes.

335
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,630
Honey.

336
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,756
But…

337
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,800
-Don't forget this.
-Thanks.

338
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,720
-it wasn't easy.
-Won't you be cold, dressed like that?

339
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:53,600
You've been coming in
for five years already.

340
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:55,477
But if you don't tell me anything,

341
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,395
I can't help you.

342
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:01,107
I'm sorry.

343
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,736
I just need some sleeping pills.

344
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,581
Then why did you say
that it was an affair?

345
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,709
I thought the truth would

346
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,254
hurt you even more.

347
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:26,841
That's why I lied.

348
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,845
You wouldn't look any further

349
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:34,391
if you thought it was an affair.

350
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,438
What about that conversation

351
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:46,486
that Ji-hoon and Soo-bin
overheard that day?

352
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,827
It's a misunderstanding.

353
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,123
-A misunderstanding?
-I tried my best to forget about it

354
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:00,417
for the past five years.

355
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:03,128
But…

356
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,590
I still couldn't set foot into his study.

357
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:10,760
Just seeing the door ajar

358
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:14,180
suffocated me.

359
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,145
But that afternoon…

360
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:24,149
-Yeo-jin.
-Yes?

361
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:26,359
Have you seen any envelopes in my study?

362
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,947
I don't know. I never go in there.

363
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,409
You don't?

364
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,119
I thought you cleaned the study.

365
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:37,412
How can you…

366
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,583
How can you even think
I could go in there?

367
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,668
-Why are you suddenly so upset?
-"Suddenly"?

368
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:45,128
Does this seem sudden to you?

369
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:47,422
I've never forgotten it for a moment.

370
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:52,010
Right. I'm sorry.

371
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,972
But I apologized for that.

372
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,392
I made a mistake.

373
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:00,477
Don't call it a mistake.

374
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:04,731
It wasn't a mistake.

375
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:06,983
Will you keep it down?

376
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:07,984
Why?

377
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:10,445
Are you afraid that Hye-joo will find out?

378
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:18,620
Fine.

379
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:21,289
It may have been a mistake to you.

380
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:24,125
But I've been confused
and tormented ever since.

381
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:30,924
I can barely look Hye-joo in the eye.

382
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,721
Everything will be fine if you keep quiet.

383
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,306
-So--
-That's enough.

384
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,142
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

385
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:50,235
When he mentioned the study
so nonchalantly,

386
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,279
I couldn't hold back my anger.

387
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,663
And Ji-hoon must've gotten the wrong idea.

388
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,179
I still couldn't set foot into his study.

389
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:21,307
Just seeing the door ajar

390
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,601
suffocated me.

391
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:31,025
The study?

392
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,945
I don't want to misplace anything
in there by mistake.

393
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:35,446
I see.

394
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,823
Sure, I'll clean it.

395
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:39,242
Thanks.

396
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:53,756
Yeo-jin.

397
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:56,134
What's wrong?

398
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:58,887
Can you close the door?

399
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,680
Right.

400
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:01,890
Okay.

401
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,892
There's a cold breeze coming in, right?

402
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,060
Gosh.

403
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:24,662
Come in.

404
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:32,670
Let's talk inside. Yoon-seo is upstairs.

405
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:42,865
I thought

406
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:46,703
you were just coming down with the flu.

407
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,790
I thought you'd feel better…

408
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,545
after a good night's sleep.

409
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:59,215
But

410
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:02,719
you've been in pain…

411
00:31:05,388 --> 00:31:07,265
all this time.

412
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,478
And I had no idea.

413
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,526
I'm sorry, Yeo-jin.

414
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:21,195
Yeo-jin.

415
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,364
I'm so sorry, Yeo-jin.

416
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,701
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:27,744
I'm…

418
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:33,041
I'm sorry.

419
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,084
I'm…

420
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:38,087
I had no idea. I'm sorry, Yeo-jin.

421
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:39,547
I'm so sorry.

422
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:46,596
You are probably the one person
in the National Assembly

423
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,099
who cares the most about
the less privileged.

424
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,228
As I've been following
your activities over the years,

425
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,189
I wasn't surprised at all

426
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:59,150
to find out that you're the one
who proposed Namgoong Sol's Law.

427
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:00,860
Thank you.

428
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,239
Was her name Chae-eun?

429
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:08,409
The girl who was murdered by her father.

430
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,288
I covered your story
when you filed that appeal

431
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:15,458
to punish filicide as an aggravated crime.

432
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,627
I see.

433
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,254
You proposed the same bill
during your last term as well, right?

434
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:22,590
Although it didn't go through.

435
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,759
He proposed it this term too.

436
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,344
It's pending at the committee.

437
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,512
I see.

438
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:28,513
I knew it.

439
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:31,307
Chae-eun's mother and the other victims

440
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,810
must feel reassured to have you.

441
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:35,978
Thank you.

442
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,441
I don't think

443
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,443
I can report him.

444
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,820
Why not?

445
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:45,655
Let's go to the police together.

446
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:47,990
It's already been five years.

447
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:49,867
There's no evidence.

448
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,248
I'm sure we can find a way.

449
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,837
I know how hard it is to be called a liar.

450
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:04,465
I've seen it.

451
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:07,135
I was right by your side.

452
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:11,431
I…

453
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:14,517
just don't want to do that.

454
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:17,603
Plus…

455
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,068
he did help me with Chae-eun's case.

456
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:26,654
I'll just

457
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,242
keep living like I have so far.

458
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:43,463
Assemblyman Nam stated
that he had evidence

459
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:46,674
of Assemblyman Kang providing
his in-laws with sensitive information

460
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:48,676
about the MOLIT's land development plans.

461
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,678
He plans to report it to the police.

462
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:54,223
As soon as Lee,
Kang's sister-in-law, purchased the land,

463
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:56,767
-the development plans were announced,
-Seung-hee.

464
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:59,687
-causing the price to skyrocket.
-Seung-hee. Where did she go?

465
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,897
Seung-hee!

466
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:11,365
Seung-hee.

467
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,249
I heard everything about your husband.

468
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:27,173
Do another interview.

469
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,343
Say that you lied yesterday

470
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:32,470
and that you framed Seung-ho.

471
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:35,431
If you don't,

472
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,478
I'll go public with
what your husband did to that woman.

473
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:46,859
Hold on.

474
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:50,071
The owner of this place
is related to that case.

475
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:52,865
-No way. Are you serious?
-Yes.

476
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:54,283
The kid who killed himself

477
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,577
after molesting that assemblyman's wife
when she was young?

478
00:34:58,037 --> 00:34:59,622
That was the owner's son.

479
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,626
And that man, Nam Joong-do,
is the victim's husband.

480
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:06,796
He seems determined to take revenge.

481
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:17,056
It was a mistake.

482
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,353
It was an accident.

483
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:26,857
It was one mistake.

484
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:40,871
How could you call that a mistake?

485
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:45,710
You can't do something
like that by mistake.

486
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:48,754
Wake up! You didn't just have an affair.

487
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,633
How?

488
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:55,595
I mean…

489
00:35:55,678 --> 00:35:57,680
Why did you do it?

490
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,226
That day, I--

491
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,311
No.

492
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,314
Don't say anything.

493
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:10,026
I don't want to hear your excuses
and I have no reason to.

494
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:11,277
Just stop talking.

495
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:19,577
I'm sorry.

496
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,289
It's all my fault.

497
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,003
How could you do something so heinous…

498
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,633
and preach Namgoong Sol's Law?

499
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:37,136
Did you never feel guilty about it?

500
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:42,516
Did you completely erase the incident
from your memory?

501
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,726
No.

502
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,979
That was the reason
I was so obsessed with the bill.

503
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,610
It was the guilt driving me at first,
but after hearing your story,

504
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,737
I became determined to push it.

505
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,657
I thought passing this law

506
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,408
would be my atonement.

507
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,704
I've truly repented
and tried my best to live righteously.

508
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,249
You know how I lived
for the past few years.

509
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,919
Don't ever say that you lived righteously.

510
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,714
You betrayed Yeo-jin, me,

511
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:19,470
and the trust of all the people
who voted for you.

512
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:22,932
And you're sitting there
telling me you lived righteously?

513
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:29,730
Turn yourself in.

514
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:32,775
If you don't, I'll disclose everything.

515
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:34,527
I'm sorry, but I can't.

516
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,654
What did you say?

517
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,116
Namgoong Sol's Law is gaining support.

518
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,660
It might really get passed.

519
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:44,912
I'm the one who proposed it.

520
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:47,456
If I turn myself in right now,

521
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:50,000
that'll be the end of the law--

522
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:51,460
Enough already!

523
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:55,047
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing about that!

524
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,433
What about Yoon-seo?

525
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:11,522
What will happen to her if this gets out?

526
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:16,026
Will she be able to go to school?

527
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,947
Will you be okay with that?

528
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:24,160
How dare you even say her name?

529
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,809
Do you know what I asked Soo-bin
when she first came to our house

530
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,811
and said she was carrying Ji-hoon's baby?

531
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:53,522
By any chance,

532
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:59,445
did Ji-hoon force you in any way
without your consent?

533
00:38:59,528 --> 00:39:00,654
Did he force himself on me?

534
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,784
No, it wasn't like that.

535
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,455
I felt terrible afterward.

536
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:12,500
I'm his mom,

537
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:15,836
and I had suspected him
of doing such a thing.

538
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:23,677
But I've never doubted you.

539
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,723
Because never in my wildest dreams
did I think you'd do something like this.

540
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:29,850
That's how much I trusted you.

541
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:37,024
Do you know why Ji-hoon made the mistake

542
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:39,235
of believing you were having an affair?

543
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,573
It's because

544
00:39:45,658 --> 00:39:48,202
he also trusted you.

545
00:39:51,747 --> 00:39:55,000
He never imagined
that you would do something like this!

546
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:57,461
That's why he thought
it was just an affair!

547
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:30,286
SONMAT NOODLES

548
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:33,497
The owner of this restaurant
tried to kill herself? Why?

549
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:34,415
I don't know.

550
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,418
But there were ambulances
and everything here last night.

551
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,841
-Excuse me.
-Goodness.

552
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:45,801
-Gosh, you scared me.
-The owner lady…

553
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:46,760
Yes?

554
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,388
Did she really try to kill herself?

555
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:51,974
Yes, but I don't know

556
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:54,435
what happened
after she was taken to the hospital.

557
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,519
Why?

558
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,023
Do you know which hospital?

559
00:40:59,732 --> 00:41:01,775
Probably Jeongsun Medical Center.

560
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,903
It's the closest hospital.

561
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:05,863
Wait, so who are you?

562
00:41:07,323 --> 00:41:10,117
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

563
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:18,000
You knew?

564
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:25,925
-Yes, sir.
-When did you find out?

565
00:41:26,008 --> 00:41:27,092
Never mind that.

566
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,345
How much did you know?

567
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,561
Everything, sir.

568
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:50,908
At first, I thought you were
just having an affair.

569
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,328
You're cheating on Mom with Aunt Yeo-jin!

570
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,621
I'm going to tell Mom.

571
00:41:55,704 --> 00:41:56,705
That's not true!

572
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:00,084
Why won't you let your mom live in peace?

573
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:03,087
Plus, do you really think
she'd believe you?

574
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:09,468
Back then, I thought it would be fine
as long as I kept my mouth shut.

575
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:11,553
Because Ji-hoon was

576
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:15,391
no longer around to disclose it.

577
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:19,103
But that was a miscalculation on my part.

578
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,730
I'll be going now.

579
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,859
Assemblyman Nam…

580
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:30,864
sexually assaulted me.

581
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:34,410
Sorry?

582
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,122
What did you just say?

583
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,501
Five years ago,

584
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:46,338
I was raped…

585
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:52,845
by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

586
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:58,392
But if I knew anything about you,

587
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:01,478
it was that you never make
the same mistake twice.

588
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:05,983
Don't…

589
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,819
do anything.

590
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,864
If people find out about this,

591
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:14,992
you won't be able
to handle the consequences.

592
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,703
The media will dig into it persistently,

593
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,414
and it'll be the talk of the town.

594
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:24,918
But most of all,
Ms. Kim will be utterly shocked.

595
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,633
In the end, you'll be left alone.

596
00:43:33,635 --> 00:43:36,138
I'm saying this for your own good.

597
00:43:41,643 --> 00:43:42,895
I advise you…

598
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:46,565
to forget about this.

599
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:54,782
I thought everything would be fine
if I quietly handled it myself.

600
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,619
I believed it would be better
if you stayed in politics.

601
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,538
For me…

602
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:06,418
and for this world.

603
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:13,967
After what happened,

604
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,763
I worked like a dog…

605
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,266
to make this world a better place.

606
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:26,104
I believed that was my way of atonement.

607
00:44:28,524 --> 00:44:31,735
Do you think Ms. Kim will
stay quiet about this?

608
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:39,993
I'll just have to believe that she will.

609
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:02,516
No.

610
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,433
Please don't get up.

611
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:10,858
Hello.

612
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,194
This is the first time we meet formally.

613
00:45:14,862 --> 00:45:18,949
So what brings you here at this hour?

614
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:26,081
Five years ago,

615
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,418
my husband, Assemblyman Nam,

616
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,839
sexually assaulted a woman.

617
00:45:38,468 --> 00:45:39,720
Yes.

618
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,097
Okay.

619
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:50,522
Ms. Kim is speaking in private
with Chairwoman Woo at the moment.

620
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:00,198
I would go to the police,

621
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:04,161
but I'm worried that
it won't be properly investigated,

622
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:06,997
or that I'll end up
getting even more hurt.

623
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:10,667
Most importantly, the victim is scared.

624
00:46:12,044 --> 00:46:15,130
She's afraid of the consequences
of this going public.

625
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:18,717
I don't know what to do.

626
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:23,263
That's why I'm here.

627
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:27,225
After all, you're the one who chose him.

628
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,822
If I were you…

629
00:46:46,244 --> 00:46:47,537
I'd keep quiet about it.

630
00:47:05,514 --> 00:47:06,765
I didn't think

631
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:09,476
Namgoong Sol's Law would pass

632
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:12,020
due to many juridical issues.

633
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:15,482
But with such enthusiastic
support from the public,

634
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,943
even if it doesn't pass,

635
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:21,613
I believe it could bring about
some meaningful changes.

636
00:47:23,031 --> 00:47:24,157
However,

637
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,245
if people find out
that the very person who proposed the bill

638
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,163
is guilty of sexual assault,

639
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,252
isn't it obvious
what would become of the bill?

640
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,756
Ms. Kim.

641
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,676
Didn't you want the bill to pass as well?

642
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,102
He tells me

643
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,521
that he has repented

644
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:57,566
and worked hard for the good of the world.

645
00:47:58,066 --> 00:48:00,902
And he asks me to put the bill first.

646
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:04,406
But I'm very confused.

647
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:08,368
To think that his efforts

648
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:11,121
really have been genuine and sincere,

649
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:14,124
it feels wrong and disgusting.

650
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,502
But to think that he's been
putting on an act all along…

651
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,131
I'd be so disheartened and miserable.

652
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,677
I'm so lost.

653
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:28,263
At this point,

654
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:31,308
I'm starting to doubt
whether it even matters

655
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:33,769
if his intention
for pushing this bill is sincere.

656
00:48:40,776 --> 00:48:41,777
You see,

657
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:46,782
I have no intention
of defending his crime.

658
00:48:47,365 --> 00:48:48,283
However,

659
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:50,243
let me tell you this

660
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,830
as someone who's in politics
for the people and the society.

661
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:58,460
If Assemblyman Nam remains in politics,

662
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,171
the world will change for the better

663
00:49:01,254 --> 00:49:04,424
with Namgoong Sol's law and more.

664
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:05,509
It will probably

665
00:49:06,218 --> 00:49:08,386
put this world closer

666
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:12,057
to your image of an ideal world.

667
00:49:14,226 --> 00:49:16,103
But some may believe

668
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:20,482
that we must sacrifice
Namgoong Sol's Law among others

669
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,112
and shed light on
what Assemblyman Nam has done

670
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:28,115
for this world to become a better place.

671
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,576
So…

672
00:49:33,286 --> 00:49:37,332
as for which option will
change this world for the better,

673
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,378
it's up to you to decide.

674
00:49:53,348 --> 00:49:54,266
So please,

675
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:56,643
Yeo-jin.

676
00:49:57,727 --> 00:49:59,146
Please keep quiet about this.

677
00:50:02,149 --> 00:50:03,775
I'll

678
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:06,027
retire from politics as soon
as the bill passes.

679
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:09,865
So please.

680
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,200
I beg of you.

681
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:17,330
Your silence will

682
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,458
change the world for the better.

683
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:23,336
I promise.

684
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,754
So please help me.

685
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:27,257
I beg of you.

686
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,054
Piece of shit.

687
00:50:46,902 --> 00:50:47,861
1 ITEM SELECTED

688
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,279
DELETE VIDEO

689
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:53,366
It's not synced to a cloud drive.

690
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:55,827
So that's it.

691
00:50:56,578 --> 00:50:57,746
It doesn't matter.

692
00:50:59,247 --> 00:51:00,582
I heard everything.

693
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:03,752
Who will believe you
when you have no proof?

694
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,506
I guess we'll find out

695
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:10,300
whether they'll believe me or not.

696
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:15,513
Here.

697
00:51:16,181 --> 00:51:18,225
This is your last warning.

698
00:51:48,755 --> 00:51:49,589
Excuse me.

699
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:52,634
Aren't you Assemblyman Nam's wife?

700
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,495
Ms. Hyeon.

701
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:23,957
I heard everything.

702
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,378
About what Mr. Nam did to you.

703
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:35,218
Call the police right now.

704
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,475
Why won't you answer me?

705
00:52:43,685 --> 00:52:45,562
If you don't do it, I will.

706
00:52:46,479 --> 00:52:47,480
Soo-bin.

707
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,942
What do you think you're doing?

708
00:52:51,026 --> 00:52:52,152
Don't do this to her.

709
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,321
She won't take it to the police.

710
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,989
You can't force her to do that.

711
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,073
I'm not.

712
00:52:58,158 --> 00:52:59,909
I'm telling her to reveal the truth.

713
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:01,745
Soo-bin.

714
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,123
No one's suffering more than her.

715
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:10,795
I was devastated when my incident
became public against my will

716
00:53:10,879 --> 00:53:12,047
and I still am.

717
00:53:12,881 --> 00:53:14,049
So please.

718
00:53:15,216 --> 00:53:16,343
Don't do this to her.

719
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,302
Also,

720
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:20,764
don't tell anyone about this.

721
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:21,681
Please.

722
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:36,863
When you appeared on the news yesterday,

723
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,867
you lied that Ji-hoon was a sex offender.

724
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:45,997
Because of you,

725
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,919
people are now spreading rumors
saying he was a serial sex offender.

726
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,383
You turned him into a sex offender.

727
00:53:58,093 --> 00:54:01,346
Why are you turning a blind eye
to the real sex offender?

728
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:12,023
If this comes to light,

729
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,609
that'll be the end of Namgoong Sol's Law.

730
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:21,199
I went through something similar
when I was young.

731
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,370
I don't feel bad that he's dead.

732
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,997
I actually think he deserved it.

733
00:54:28,957 --> 00:54:30,083
However,

734
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:32,669
people criticized me

735
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:36,297
for telling a lie
and causing a person to die.

736
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:38,758
I hope

737
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:41,469
that bill will be passed

738
00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:44,013
so that there won't be any more victims

739
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,099
like us.

740
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:52,480
Countless people are desperately waiting
for Namgoong Sol's Law,

741
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:56,359
and I don't want
there to be any more victims.

742
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,154
So…

743
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:02,699
I believe keeping this a secret

744
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,619
will ultimately be
the better decision for this world.

745
00:55:15,086 --> 00:55:16,337
You know what it's like

746
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:21,259
to be falsely branded as a liar
and to suffer because of it.

747
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,139
And now…

748
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,975
you say you want to reveal the truth,

749
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,897
but you're turning a blind eye
to another truth.

750
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,611
Are you really okay with that?

751
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:23,756
Yoon-seo.

752
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:25,800
Yes?

753
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:36,686
I'm…

754
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,485
I'm…

755
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:56,497
I AM KIM HYE-JOO,
THE WIFE OF ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO…

756
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,636
I am Kim Hye-joo.

757
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:15,808
My son…

758
00:58:19,187 --> 00:58:21,606
did not sexually assault anyone.

759
00:58:23,858 --> 00:58:24,901
I…

760
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:27,320
NAM'S WIFE KIM HYE-JOO'S PRESS CONFERENCE

761
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,948
lied despite knowing the truth.

762
00:58:31,032 --> 00:58:32,116
And…

763
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:35,578
my husband…

764
00:58:50,301 --> 00:58:53,054
sexually assaulted a woman five years ago.

765
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:32,051
