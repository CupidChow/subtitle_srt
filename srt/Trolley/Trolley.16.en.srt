Since he owned up to it,

you could have talked in private

Did you really have to advertise it

Ms. Hyeon is making false accusations.

She put her restaurant up for sale.

00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,680
As for Ms. Kim,

156
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,308
we'll say she was mentally unstable

157
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,143
due to Ji-hoon's incident and her past

158
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,020
and blindly believed Ms. Hyeon.

159
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,982
-Jang Woo-jae.
-Your marriage is already over.

160
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,234
So deny it at all costs.

161
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,861
There's no evidence,

162
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,239
so even if they take you to court,
it will take a while,

163
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,742
and people will have forgotten by then.

164
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,038
So don't turn yourself in.

165
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,877
Why won't you say anything?

166
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,880
Answer me, sir.

167
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,594
Do you understand me, sir?

168
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,304
You can't turn yourself in.

169
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,890
Okay?

170
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,350
Answer me.

171
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,978
Please just answer me!

172
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,694
You can't turn yourself in.

173
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,115
Not after what I've done for you.

174
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,495
DAEHAN PARTY
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO SUPPORTERS

175
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,138
Promise me that you'll
never turn yourself in.

176
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,390
Are you just going to give up?

177
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,977
Are you going to throw it all away?

178
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,569
If you admit to the allegations,

179
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,363
all your achievements and plans…

180
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,534
They'll all go down the drain.
Is that what you want?

181
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,460
So just deny the allegations,

182
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,713
get Namgoong Sol's Law passed,

183
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,968
continue to do good for our society,

184
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,012
and create a better world.

185
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,227
That's how you can atone
for what you've done.

186
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,449
<i><font color="white">The person you are
trying to reach is currently…</font></i>

187
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,910
MS. KIM

188
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,752
-This morning, Ms. Kim Hye-joo…
-Listen.

189
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,755
-Who are we?
-…exposed her husband's sex crime

190
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,674
–and it's been causing a great stir.
-Assemblyman Nam Joong-do…

191
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,927
-His whereabouts are currently unknown…
-Many people are out here…

192
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,930
I know her well
because I've worked for her.

193
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,307
There's no way she was raped.

194
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,935
Why would he do that
when he has a young and pretty wife?

195
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,770
It doesn't make any sense.

196
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,313
And if what she said was true,

197
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,857
how could they have been
living under the same roof?

198
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,694
So why do you think she started this?

199
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,489
She had feelings for Assemblyman Nam.

200
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,575
Right. A long time ago,

201
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,954
he gave her legal assistance
after her husband killed her daughter.

202
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,165
That's when she got feelings for him.
But when he turned her down,

203
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,793
she lied that he had raped her.

204
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,797
When I found out about her feelings,
she fired me right there and then.

205
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,048
She's lying!

206
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,219
She got fired for stealing money.
That's why she's bad-mouthing her.

207
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,471
-I didn't steal anything!
-I saw you!

208
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,557
Everything she says is a lie--

209
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,475
I'm sorry, but who are you?

210
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,686
Do you know the victim?

211
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,521
Or are you Ms. Kim's acquaintance?

212
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,022
How do you know them?

213
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,280
I'm just…

214
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:49,991
a kid they know.

215
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,325
-How do you know them?
-How do you know them?

216
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,244
What's your relationship with Ms. Kim?

217
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,204
-Tell us!
-Who are you?

218
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,540
-What's the relationship?
-Do you know the victim?

219
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,000
-Tell us!
-Say something!

220
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,878
-Tell us who you are!
-What's your relationship?

That's enough.

229
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,568
I know how you feel,
but this has nothing to do with Seung-ho.

230
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,195
What are you saying?

231
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,406
Her family didn't just screw me
with Seung-ho's incident.

232
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,493
I've been losing sleep
over that land deal.

233
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,579
But Nam Joong-do is going down on his own.
How great is that?

234
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,665
With that land, I can make
at least 30 billion won.

235
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,626
What do you know?

236
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,586
Goodness.

237
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,381
I should give Soon-hong a call.

Seung-hee. Ms. Lee.

239
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,135
Hey, Ki-young.

240
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,972
You couldn't have cared less
if I got discharged from the hospital.

241
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,474
Are you here to get your share?

242
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:01,395
You did absolutely nothing
to resolve that land issue,

243
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,105
so don't even dream about it.

244
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,482
Uncle Soon-hong announced

245
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,402
that he'd sell the land
and donate the profits.

246
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,946
What?

247
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,031
He's going to do what?

248
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,534
Nam Joong-do got his hands
on some evidence

249
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,869
of you and Uncle's land speculation.

250
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,497
That's why Uncle Soon-hong
turned his back on you.

251
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,582
There's no way.

Call Nam Joong-do right now

00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,429
and tell him to bring the evidence. Now!

258
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,014
He's not insane.

259
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,349
Why would he give it back?

260
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,143
Make a deal with him.

261
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,480
Tell him I'll forget about Kim Jae-eun

262
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,483
as long as he lets me keep my land.

263
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,485
You can't make a deal with that.

264
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,530
You lied about Jae-eun to begin with.

265
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,323
Who cares about that?

266

Everyone believed me!

267
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,289
Go ask what I can do for him.

268
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,792
If he tells me to sign a paper that says

269
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,794
Kim Jae-eun didn't lie, I will.

270
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,004
-So please--
-Mom.

271
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,596
What are you talking about?

272
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,353
Was Jae-eun really molested by Seung-ho?

273
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,897
And you knew that?

274
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,863
Say something!

275
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,826
Yes.

276
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,579
I lied.

277
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,042
No matter what happens,

278
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,670
my child comes before anyone else.

279
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,256
You ruined a person's life

280
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,508
just to cover up your child's fault.

281
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,053
Would you prefer it

282
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,141
if I went around telling everyone

283
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,893
what my own son did?

284
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,313
I would rather die.

285
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,773
I could never…

286
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,109
-Mom!
-Ms. Lee.

287
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,407
After I found out

288
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,078
she had lied about Jae-eun,

289
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,581
I hoped the truth would come out

290
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,042
whether it was about the land or Seung-ho.

291
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,585
That's why

292
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,671
I took this risk.

293
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,133
All this time,

294
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,345
I thought

295
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,390
Jae-eun was the one lying.

296
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,740
It's a friend's vacation home.

297
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,827
You can stay with me and clear your mind.

298
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,761
I'll grab a few things we'll need.

299
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,874

307
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,279
Long ago,

308
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,072
I had to suffer

309
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,784
because of an irresponsible choice
made by someone else.

310
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,080
And I was denied the opportunity

don't you know it'll hurt everyone

Do you want to be remembered

358
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,815
I was…

00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,236
so ashamed of what I'd done.

360
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,614
I couldn't take it anymore.

361
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,872
Then just live with that shame.

Live in shame and be punished!

Why would you die?

366
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,007
I was too arrogant.

367
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,929
I had sincerely repented
and apologized for what I had done,

368
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,641
so I thought I had been forgiven.

369
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,602
That's why I tried my best…

370

to make the world better
as a means of atonement.

371
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,987
But that was just me being arrogant.

372
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,492
I shouldn't have been the one…

00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,131
I won't…

376

make any excuses.

Right.

473
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,579
Because you had fun with Ji-hoon too?

It was yours, not Ji-hoon's.

479

What?

480
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,220

If I have to be punished, so be it.

One more thing.

I just don't have many photos of him.

506
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,743
I was wondering if you had any.

507
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,162
Is there something important
on that phone?

508
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:23,499
You could have gotten

Ji-hoon said…

he regretted getting into
trouble after finding out

513

about his dad.

514
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,153
At first, he was disgusted
by his dad and Ms. Hyeon…

<i><font color="white">-…and Mom seemed completely oblivious.</font></i>

Be safe.

519
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,665
I ended up on the news

520
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,794
and started getting in my dad's way.

521
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,589
I thought I should
actually ruin his career

for good.

523
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,761
But that was stupid of me.

but to do as he was told.

He also said…

he didn't want to break your heart again.

00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,388
you did the right thing
by telling your mom.

630
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,599
Thanks.

631
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,313
Do you

632
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,441
still resent your mom

633
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,153
for exposing your dad?

634
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:26,328
Because she was the one
who gave me courage.

635
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,081
She was?

636
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:31,041
Yes.

637
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,128
She faced the inconvenient truth

638
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,505
and decided not to hide it.

639
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,174
It takes great courage.

640
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,802
Now that I've done it,
I'm starting to get it.

641
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,812
Gross. A rapist?

642
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,272
That is so disgusting.

643
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,773
I'd drop out if I were her.

644
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,066
Does she have no shame?

645
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,818
-Hey.
-Yes.

646
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,195
I'm a rapist's daughter.

647
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,324
But I'm also the daughter of my mom,
who bravely exposed him.

648
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:05,659
Why don't you talk about that?

649
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,495
If you want to talk about my parents,

650
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,205
you should acknowledge my mom too.

Don't cry.

666

YOU INSPIRED ME TO BE BRAVE
THANK YOU

667
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,714
I still can't sleep without the pills.

668
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,302
But it's much better than before.

669

I could…

670

get better from now on, right?
