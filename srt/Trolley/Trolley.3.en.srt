JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

2
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,305
Today, we'll be learning about
the Trolley Dilemma.

3
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,558
Who knows what a "trolley" is?

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,061
-What is that?
-Trolley?

5
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,396
-Beats me.
-What is it?

6
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,693
It's a streetcar. Do you recognize it now?

7
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,195
-I've seen that on TV.
-I see.

8
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,488
I saw it in a movie.

9
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,950
This trolley's brakes are broken,

10
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,662
and there are five workers
working on the track.

11
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,416
<i><font color="white">If you do nothing about it,
all five of them will die.</font></i>

12
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,335
But if you pull a lever,

13
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,922
you can change the trolley's course

14
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,549
to a different track.

15
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,175
However,

16
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,346
there's another worker working
on that track as well.

17
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,224
Let's think about this.

18
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,851
If you don't do anything,

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,770
<i><font color="white">the trolley will kill five people.</font></i>

20
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,816
<i><font color="white">If you pull the lever
to change its direction,</font></i>

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,068
<i><font color="white">the five workers will survive</font></i>

22
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,404
<i><font color="white">but that one worker will die.</font></i>

23
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,492
What will be your decision?

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,704
I'll definitely pull the lever.

25
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,205
I'm not sure.

26
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,123
Yes?

27
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,668
I would definitely switch the tracks.
It's five to one.

28
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,130
But those five were fated to die.

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,216
If I pull the lever, that one worker

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,302
would suddenly meet their death.

31
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,220
That would haunt me forever.

32
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,681
This is giving me a headache.

33
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,391
Do we have to decide?

34
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,352
Then who will?

35
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,770
Not me.

36
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,980
Hey, you can decide.

37
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,441
No. Why should I?

38
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,735
There's no right answer to this dilemma.

39
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,695
We each have an opinion.

40
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,824
All right. Write a paper
about what you would do and why.

41
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,494
Then submit it in two weeks.

42
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,041
Seung-kyu.

43
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:46,958
Seung…

44
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,923
-Seung…
-Seung-kyu.

45
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,424
-Seung-kyu.
-Seung-kyu.

46
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,676
Seung-kyu!

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,428
-Seung-kyu!
-Seung-kyu.

48
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,307
Please come this way. It's all right.

49
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,600
Help!

50
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
Please help.

51
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,062
-Help!
-It's all right.

52
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:18,031
MURDERER
NAM JOONG-DO

53
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,409
THE BLAME

54
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,244
Good work.

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,870
-Good work.
-Good work.

56
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,172
This is Nam Joong-do.

57
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,260
Of course, I remember you.

58
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,471
Ms. Na Mun-suk, the head
of Taeyang Apartment's resident committee.

59
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,141
Didn't we meet
at the district office last time?

60
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,893
Yes, it really is my personal number.

61
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,483
NEW MESSAGE FROM
SENIOR SECRETARY LEE SANG-HUN

62

<i><font color="white">The police, as they deemed the assailant…</font></i>

72
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,810
I see.

73
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,523
But like I told you before,

74
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,942
I have no say in that.

75
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,573
Yes, that would be an issue
with the procedure.

76
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,035
Is that so?

77
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,912
What is it?

78
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,539
All right.

79
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,585
I will relay your message
to our district office

80
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,796
and get back to you.

81
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,797
Goodbye.

82
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,968
What's the matter?

83
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,763
Sir.

84
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
<i><font color="white">What is she doing?</font></i>

85
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,563
I don't know. She's in her room.

86
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,732
What could she be doing in there all day?

87
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,275
She even lost her phone.

88
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,402
Just let her be. Yes.

89
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,738
Call me if anything happens, okay?

90
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,658
All right. See you tonight. Bye.

91
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,553
It's illegal to have a paternity test
for an unborn baby, sir.

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,390
It's not impossible,

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,309
but it's too big of a risk
with the general election coming up.

94
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,314
Let her stay here.

95
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,692
That lowers the risk,

96
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,194
and she may be helpful to us.

97
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,531
Not only did you lose Ji-hoon,

98
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,492
but you took in his pregnant girlfriend
who had nowhere to stay.

99
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,370
They'll feel your sincerity.

100
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,873
Woo-jae, that wasn't what I meant.

101
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,916
I know, ma'am.

102
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,085
I understand.

103
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,756
What I'm saying is that the girl
may seem like a ticking bomb,

104
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,469
but she could actually be
a double-edged sword for us.

105
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,472
It was only a couple of days ago

106
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,975
that the Nation and People's Party
were on our case

107
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,853
about Ji-hoon's meth possession
and the favor from the police.

108
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,272
The election is in seven months.

109
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,484
If you kick her out now,
things could get out of control.

110
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,362
You should be glad that she came to you.

111
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,490
Imagine if she had gone
to the opposing party instead.

112
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,577
We don't know
her true intentions just yet,

113
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,581
but you should keep her here

114
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,834
and humor her for the time being.

115
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,339
Sir.

116
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,175
You have to focus on the general election.

117
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,703
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

118
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,847
Who was it that you had to
take the call outside?

119
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,141
-Was it a guy?
-Don't be ridiculous.

120
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,601
You still have a lot to do.

121
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,104
Are you dizzy again?

122
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,148
Sit down. Goodness.

123
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,030
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

124
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,701
You were doing better
after taking herbal medicine.

125
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,745
I'll finish up making the dumplings.
Just go home and rest.

126
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,208
I've already been clocking out early
despite being the owner.

127
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,585
-Now you want me to leave earlier?
-Yes.

128
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,381
-Gosh.
-Do you want some water?

129
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,272
Come in.

130
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,318
What were you up to?

131
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,904
Nothing.

132
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,950
I need to go to work. This is your lunch.

133
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,410
Okay. Goodbye.

134
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,581
Also, I thought you'd be bored
since you lost your phone.

135
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,625
Yoon-seo and I enjoyed reading them,
but I'm not sure if you'll like them.

136
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,086
Okay. I'll give them a try.

137
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,547
Okay. I'll be back.

138
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,090
Okay.

139
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,053
<i><font color="white">Take that girl to a hospital
and get her tested for drugs.</font></i>

140
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,433
Tomorrow, are you--

141
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,478
Right. I'm going to the hospital later.

142
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,773
I'm going to get that drug test.

143
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,484
I gave it some thought.

144
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,070
I think it makes sense
that you and your husband

145
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,905
have trouble trusting me.

146
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,033
After all, Ji-hoon had bought drugs.

147
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,410
Although he didn't use them.

148
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,789
I swear that I'm clean as well.

149
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,457
I'll prove it to you.

150
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,295
Okay. Thanks.

151
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,379
Don't mention it.

152
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,758
Then I'll be out later today.

153
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,095
I'll go to work then.
I'll be back before dinnertime.

154
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,429
Okay. Goodbye.

155
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,893
You know, that lid…

157
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,991

158

Everything looks so interesting here.

159
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,594
I heard you fix books.

160
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,225
Ji-hoon told me.

161
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,729
-He told you that?
-Yes.

162
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,107
How do you fix books?

163
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,984
Well…

164
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,279
I tend to say "conserve"
rather than "fix."

165
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,448
What's the difference?

166
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,788
Take a seat and have a look.

167
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,003
ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE

168
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,796
I'm sorry. Just a second.

169
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,428
I reported it to him.

170
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,513
Let's get to work.

171
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,307
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

172
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,148
Hello, this is Ko Min-seok.

173
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,775
We'll contact you right away
once we're ready.

174
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,237
If it isn't Mr. Park Yeong-su.

175
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,866
When are we going out for drinks?

176
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,702
Are we strangers
just because I quit eight years ago?

177
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,000
I know, why did he have to fall
in front of the kindergarten bus

178
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,335
and traumatize the kids?

179
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,129
Assemblyman Nam's statement?

180
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,757
We're still working on it.

181
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,508
Yes.

182
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,428
I'll send it over as soon as we're done.

183
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,222
Okay.

184
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,558
Goodbye.

185
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,271
We'll need a draft of his statement.

186
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,564
Sure.

187
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,612
I'll be back in a bit.

188
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,655
-Okay.
-Okay.

189
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,951
<i><font color="white">Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party</font></i>

190
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,119

193
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,007
Hello, ma'am.

194
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,302
Thank you so much for your time.

195
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,096
Don't mention it.

196
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,349
I should be the one
thanking you for inviting me.

197
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,270
She's put so much effort
into preparing for your visit

198
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,940
over the past three months.

199
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,776
And I've been losing sleep
for the past three months

200
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,278
because I was so eager
to participate in this seminar.

201
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,907
-Shall we go inside?
-Sure.

202
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,866
This way.

203
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,582
What's the matter?

204
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,003
Ji Seung-kyu jumped off a building.

205
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,132
He jumped off a building?

206
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,843
Ma'am, are you serious?

207
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,597
That medical student committed suicide
by jumping off a building?

208
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,392
Yes, the articles
are being posted as we speak.

209
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:34,063
Come to think of it,
Assemblyman Nam was often referred to

210
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,482
as Daehan Party's sharpshooter.

211
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,527
But publicly attacking a mere civilian

212
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,531
and driving him to suicide?

213
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,950
I'd say this is a terrible case of…

214
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,746
improper handling of a firearm.

215
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,748
You're absolutely right.

216
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,000
Goodness.

217
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,586
JI SEUNG-KYU'S SUICIDE
SHARPSHOOTER NAM'S IMPROPER HANDLING

218
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,841
Mr. Shin.

219
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,593
Yes, sir.

220
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,306
Although there's nothing
we could possibly do to comfort

221
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,767
the parents who lost
their child so tragically,

222
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,853
find out where his wake is being held

223
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,356
and send them some flowers under my name.

224
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,025
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,488
Goodness.

226
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,282
I can't fathom
how Assemblyman Nam must feel.

227
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,410
Anyway, we'll get going.

228
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,537
-Please call me if anything happens.
-I will.

229
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,622
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

230
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,540
Let's go.

231
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,011
FUNERAL HALL

232
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,024
No way.

233
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,693
How is this possible?

234
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,697
This is so fascinating.

235
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,035
It's a totally different book.

236
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,456
Do you think

237
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,750
this could be done with people too?

238
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,669
What?

239
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,842
I was just asking.

240
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,303
So…

241
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,098
why did you bring me here?

242
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,017
Right. Can you give me
that thing from earlier?

243
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,228
Right.

244
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,752
There.

245
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,089
No way.

246
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,757
Here you go.

247
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,759
This must be a new lipstick.

248
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,054
Someone gave it to me.

249
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,141
And it's a lip balm, not lipstick.

250
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,935
It's for moisturizing your lips.

251
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,313
I see.

252
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,565
They make such great products these days.

253
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,567
It's a pretty color too. It suits you.

254
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,952
By the way, what's that?

255
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,080
It's a dehumidifier.

256
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,876
Since I work with paper,

257
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,587
maintaining the right amount
of humidity is crucial.

258
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,923
It can't be too humid or dry here.

259
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,344
What if the weather
was fine during the day,

260
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,763
but it starts to rain at night
when you're home?

261
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,848
In that case…

262
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,354
I can control it remotely
through the app on my phone.

263
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,814
That's cool.

264
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,778
But if it suddenly
starts pouring at night,

265
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,155
I come by to check at times.

266
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,242
Why? I thought you could do it
on your phone.

267
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,247
Because I'd rather check in person.

268
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,792
Come take a look.

269
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,261
These are all my clients' books.

270
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,806
I can't have these books
getting more damaged.

271
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:42,019
After all, they entrusted me
with their precious books

272
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,648
that they've cherished for years.

273
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,734
So when there's heavy rain,

274
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,279
I can't just rely on my phone.

275
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,907
I have to come and see for myself
that these books are safe.

276
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,744
Seeing them for myself
is much more reassuring.

277
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,415
Yes. I guess you're right.

278
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,630
Where did you learn to do this?

279
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,439
BOOK REPAIR

280
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,195
<i><font color="white">I used to go to the library often</font></i>

281
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,781
<i><font color="white">when I worked at the welfare center.</font></i>

282
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:36,866
<i><font color="white">Then one day,</font></i>

283
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,830
<i><font color="white">I saw that the library</font></i>

284
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:46,167
<i><font color="white">was looking for volunteers
in the book repair department.</font></i>

285
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,460
You're here again.

286
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,544
Hello.

287
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,174
Excuse me.

288
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,763
Thank you.

289
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,605
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

290
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,899
Do you want to give this a try?

291
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,402
I do.

292
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,280
All right.

293
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,990
Make sure to remove all the adhesives.

294
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,242
That's it. You're doing great.

295
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,858
<i><font color="white">The more I conserved damaged books,</font></i>

296
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,235
<i><font color="white">the more fascinating it got.</font></i>

297
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,863
<i><font color="white">It became fun and I wanted to know more.</font></i>

298
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:06,497
Then I taught myself
through books and online research,

299
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,915
and I opened up this studio

300
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,126
after quitting my job there.

301
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,671
Hello, I'm afraid Assemblyman Nam
can't do any interviews for now.

302
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,966
-Yes. We're still looking into it.
-I see.

303
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,469
-I'll call after we release a statement.
-A statement?

304
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,721
-He's…
-Thank you.

305
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,974
We're still working on it.

306
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,934
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,854
We'll email it to you
as soon as it's ready.

308
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,606
Thank you.

309
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,027
All the reporters are waiting
for his statement, aren't they?

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,944
Yes.

311
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,533
This is Assemblyman Nam's office.

312
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,035
This is Assemblyman Nam's office.

313
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,580
-We're still looking into it.
-Hello. Yes.

314
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,498
Right.

315
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,874
We're sorry.

316
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,004
Please be patient,
and we'll send out his statement soon.

317
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,134
-Thank you.

Did you cancel your old phone?

324
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,151
You don't want a stranger using it.

325
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,028
I did.

326
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,531
There's nothing important in there anyway.

Like I said before,

331
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,130
this is Yeo-jin's restaurant

00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:24,927
If you want to live with us,
you should get to know the staff here.

333

Who will you tell them I am?

334
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,399
Just tell them I'm some kid you know.

335
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,570
Okay. I'll say that.

336
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,071
Let's go inside.

337
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,450
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

338
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,870
-Please throw away the receipt.
-Sure.

339

-Have a good day.
-You too.

340

Have a good one.

She sure has a great appetite.

342
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,137
You were so skinny when you were pregnant
because you couldn't eat anything.

343
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,514
It's different for everyone.

344
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,933
And I had it rough back then.

345
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,978
I was pregnant with Yoon-seo not long
after my mother-in-law passed away,

346
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,147
and Ji-hoon was starting school soon.

347
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,275
And my husband was too busy with his work.

348
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,153
I felt so helpless.

349
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,739
When you moved in with us,

350
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,949
you didn't just move in.

351
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,826
You practically saved my life.

352
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,245
That's why you're my savior.

353
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,789
One who came to ruin your life?

354
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:36,915
Yes.

355
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,251
That's why you should always
be there for me.

356
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,377
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,296
Can I have some more kimchi?

358
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,632
Yes, ma'am.

359
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,563
Soo-bin.

360
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,398
You can get home by yourself, right?

I consider myself a part of their family.

I can do anything for them.

that I couldn't look my granddaughter

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,943
Assemblyman Nam can overcome this.

477
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,655
This is a surprise.

478
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,535
Your in-laws' real estate speculation
which Assemblyman Nam mentioned

479
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,456
seemed to be getting swept
under the rug due to this current matter.

480
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,167
So I thought you'd be glad.

481
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,879
I was actually worried
about whether or not

482
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,173
you'd be able to overcome it.

483
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,926
What are you…

484
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,261
Goodbye, then.

485
00:32:58,852 --> 00:32:59,728
Why that…

486
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,024
I see.

487
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,859
Thank you.

488
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,154
Goodbye.

489
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,657
Was it another call
complimenting Assemblyman Nam?

490
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,658
Yes.

491
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,495
They thanked him
for taking out the garbage

492
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,954
and said they'll keep rooting for him.

493
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:23,710
Right. It was the caller who used
the word "garbage," not me.

494
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,172
You know, it would be more helpful

495
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,090
if they thanked us by making a donation.

496
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,842
Exactly.

497
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,554
I was worried sick earlier.
I'm just glad things are working out.

498
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,931
Agreed.

499
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,017
I'm exhausted right now
from being so tense all day.

500
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,270
All right. Who's down for a drink
after work today?

501
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,272
-I am.
-Should I book a place?

502
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,232
Sure.

503
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,691
Why? I thought it was good.

504
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,194
You liked the eggplants?

505
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,946
Yes. It wasn't bad.

506
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,158
Yoon-seo, did you watch the news?

507
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,202
I can't believe it.

508
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,411
What do you mean?

509
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,329
You haven't heard?

510
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,624
You know that medical student
your dad called out on the news?

511
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,875
He committed suicide today.

512
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,673
Your dad is so amazing.
Justice was served.

513
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,675
Seriously. He's the best.

514
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,802
I can't believe it either.

515
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,055
Seriously. It'd be a waste of tax money
to send him to prison.

516
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,267
I wish all murderers and robbers
would commit suicide too.

517
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,228
-That's intense.
-I wish…

518
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,397
adulterers would also die.

00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,721
Yes, sir.

634
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,816
Are you going somewhere?
We can drive you there.

635
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,027
That's okay. Could you take
my suit to a dry cleaner?

636
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,197
I'm sorry. See you tomorrow.

637
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,643
By the way,

638
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,398
do you have to graduate from university
to become a book conservator?

639
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,026
I didn't go to university.

640
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,071
-Really?
-Yes.

641
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,156
I see.

642
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,157
Right.

643
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,534
I think Ji-hoon mentioned that.

644
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,583
He told you that?

645
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,126
Yes.

646
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,090
I don't have any parents. Just like you.

647
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,345
Ji-hoon told me.

648
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,059
Did he tell you anything else?

649
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:32,229
Did Ji-hoon tell you
anything else about me?

650
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:41,989
He did.

651
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,789
That you're not his birth mother.

652
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,003
Anything else?

653
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,131
No.

654
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:00,925
That's all.

655
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:13,980
I'm sorry, Soo-bin,

656
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,565
but could you go
and buy me a bottle of water?

657
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,776
Water?

658
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,029
Do you remember seeing
a convenience store nearby?

659
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,489
Can you get me one from there?

660
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,992
I forgot to buy it.

661
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:28,995
Sure.

662
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:32,248
My purse is in my handbag. Take it.

663
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,874
I have enough money for water.

664
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,127
I'll be back.

665

What did you expect?

668
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,299
Mom, I'm home.

669
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,801
You came together.

670
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,056
Yes, I picked her up from the airport.

671
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,767
Why didn't you just leave
while you were at the airport?

672
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,101
Why did you come back?

673
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,688
Come on, Mom.

674
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,274
Don't be like that.

675
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,318
Didn't you miss me? It's been three years.

676
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,821
Why would I miss the daughter
who abandoned me?

677
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,899
Honey.

678
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,445
Hye-joo.

679
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,251
This is just too hard.

680
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,053
Someone died…

681
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,642
because of me.

682
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,360
No.

683
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,904
It wasn't your fault.

684
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,366
You didn't do anything wrong.
You're not to blame, honey.

685
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,786
You didn't know this would happen.

686

But…

687
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,378
But they lost their son

688
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,839

Don't worry about tomorrow.

Goodbye. Go home safely.

HAJEONG-DONG, SINYANG-GU

715
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,922
She must work at the community center.

No.

717
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,009
I asked her and she said she didn't.

718
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,471
Then where?

719
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,015
I'm not sure. I don't even know her name.

720
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,892
She won't tell me.

721
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,229
But you haven't told me
where you're from either, young man.

722
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,816
I'm not that young.

723
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,818
Goodness. Are you married?

724

You look so young.

725
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,238
I have a child.

-Ma'am, the stew is getting cold.

-Okay.

It's been three years now.

Who could it be?

730
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,862
They sent us a hefty sum.

731
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,821
Exactly.

732
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,533
-And it's anonymous, so they'll be taxed.
-Did the Anonymous Angel come by again?

733
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,370
Yes. Along with a million won,
just like the other times.

734
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,913
Let me help.

-One, two…
-One, two…

I fixed it,

It's okay. You two stay and eat.
I'll go get it.

Sit down.

758

Come on.

759
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,927
About that rice…

760
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,723
I didn't tell anyone, so don't worry.

I'm Hye-joo.

How pretty.

768
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,050
I meant your name. You have a pretty name.

769
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,297
My child died

770
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,341
because of you.

771
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,221
Get out!

How dare you come here?

773

Get out of here this instant!

774
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,268
Get out!

775
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,771
How dare you set foot in here?

776
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,363
Mom, I'm hungry. Let's eat.

777

-I don't want to.
-We haven't eaten together in a while.

Why are you being so friendly? Let me go.

-Mom.
-Did you forget that you left me?

780
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,480
Will you have the baby?

781
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,361
I'm not sure. Would you prefer that?

782
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,783
I guess that depends on who the father is.

783
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,245
Ji-hoon might not be the father.

784

You're right.

785
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,630
He might not be.
