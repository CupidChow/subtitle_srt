00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:18,434
Your husband is…

2
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,438
having an affair with that lady.

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,859
Ji-hoon and I saw everything
at your house that day.

4
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,572
That's why he went
to see his dad that night.

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,950
To tell him he knows
and that he needs to stop.

6
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,786
That's why I think…

7
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,790
he might have killed Ji-hoon.

AUGUST 19, 2022
THE DAY OF JI-HOON'S ACCIDENT

12
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,315
Mom.

13
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,153
I guess she's not here.

14

15
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,584
MOM

16
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,088
Let's go to my house.

17
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,424
She must be there.

18
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,178
Your house?

19
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,305
That would be kind of awkward--

20
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,306
It's okay.

21
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,683
My mom will definitely help you.

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,853
She knows

23
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,939
what it's like to be without family.

24
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,777
You want to end it with Jung-dae,

25
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:52,779
don't you?

26
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,373
Who parked in front of my house?

27
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,424
Come in.

28
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,113
Mom.

29
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,335
Why did you stop in high school?

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,838
What?

31
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,048
You stopped measuring after middle school.

32
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,385
No reason.

33
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,554
Here's some water.

34
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,806
Thanks.

35
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,108
Can I take a nap until your mom gets home?

36
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,986
I've been oddly tired lately.

37
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,612
I can't seem to stay awake.

38
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,825
-Sure.
-Just a quick nap.

39
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,938
Where are you going?

40
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,612
Is your mom here?

41
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,323
No.

42
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,535
Then what is it?

43
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,407
I made a mistake.

44
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,741
Don't call it a mistake.

45
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,120
It wasn't a mistake.

46
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,163
Will you keep it down?

47
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,081
Why?

48
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,292
Are you afraid that Hye-joo will find out?

49
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:41,799
Fine.

50
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,802
It may have been a mistake for you.

51
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,763
But I've been confused
and tormented ever since.

52
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,101
I can barely…

53
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,260
Let's get out of here.

54
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,602
Hey.

55
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,230
Are you all right?

56
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,027
Don't tell anyone

57
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,988
about what you just saw.

58
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,865
Okay.

00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,580
5 YEARS AGO, THE NIGHT OF

<i><font color="white">It's so disgusting.</font></i>

64
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,384
That was five years ago
and it's still going on.

65
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,428
That's exactly why I left home.

66
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,771
I'm sorry you had to see me like this.

67
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,817
It's so embarrassing.

68
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,988
I feel the same way.

69
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,742
I've been trying to break up
with Jung-dae but I can't.

70
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,204
And you've put up with that.

71
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,543
I'm surrounded by pieces of shit.

72
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:52,800
That does it.

73
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,468
I need to meet Dad.

74
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,846
-Right now?
-No.

75
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,764
I can't see him at this hour anyway.

76
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,724
His schedule is always full.

77
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,394
He wouldn't show up

78
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,146
unless I was dead or something.

79
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,399
Jung-dae wanted to see me today.

80
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,818
I'll meet up with him first

81
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,736
and I'll go see my dad late at night.

82
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,033
Do you have to meet Jung-dae?

83
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,536
Why does he want to see you?

84
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,705
No idea.

85
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,040
But if I don't go,

86
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,876
he'll think I helped you run away.

87
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:35,301
I'm going to tell my dad
that I'll expose his affair

88
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,011
if he doesn't stop now.

89
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,180
If he wants to keep
his political career alive,

90
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:42,474
he'll have to stop.

I'm sorry, but who are you?

Could you let me stay here?

109

Ji-hoon said he was going to

threaten his dad
saying he'll expose his affair.

111
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,765
That's why I'm saying his death
might not have been an accident.

112
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,975
That's not what happened, Soo-bin.

113

Ji-hoon was going to…

114

I know his text said he was going to
kill himself because of me.

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,812
<i><font color="white">I'm going to kill him.</font></i>

162
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,523
I'M GOING TO KILL MYSELF

163
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,486
At first,

164
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,114
I tried to tell myself
that no father would kill his own son.

165
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,993
And the news said Ji-hoon
got drunk and fell to his death,

166
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,328
so I believed that.

167
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,040
But I changed my mind
when Mr. Nam went ahead

168
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,668
and held that press conference
after I told him I wasn't raped.

169
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,713
He's definitely capable

170
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,132
of killing his own son

171
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,052
over his affair.

172
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,853
I had no money after I left your house,

173
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,855
so I went to blackmail him.

174
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,608
He told me he'd find me a place to stay

175
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,194
if I kept my mouth shut about it

176
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,364
and went along with the rape story.

177
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,244
That's why I stayed quiet
after the press conference.

178
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,455
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,170
But something is definitely going on

180
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,006
between those two.

181
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,093
And it has been for years.

182
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,213
You didn't pick up your phone.

183
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,508
Were you at the studio?

184
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,760
Yes, it's raining.

185
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,180
You were asleep, so I snuck out.

186
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,682
I didn't know you called.

187
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,395
You walked there in the rain?
You should have woken me up.

188
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,356
I woke up, so I started some work.

189
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,235
Right, and your car will be here tomorrow.

190
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,487
Okay.

191
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,197
Let's go back to sleep. It's late.

192
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,913
Wait.

193
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,668
I forgot to finish up some work.

194
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,919
You did?

195
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,340
Yes, I'll do it on Yoon-seo's computer.
You can go to sleep first.

196
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,550
It's late. Do it tomorrow.

197
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,509
No.

198
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,762
I have to do it today.

199
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,722
You go ahead.

200
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,766
Are you sure?

201
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,310
Then I'll work some more too.

202
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,188
Let me know when you're done.
I'll go to sleep then.

203
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,315
Okay, I will.

204
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,307
JANG ***-JAE

205
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,185
<i><font color="white">They're the dashcam and items

213
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,692
and Ms. Hyeon accompanied me.

214
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,069
You didn't know, right?

215
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,948
That's because I told her
I'd expose her affair

216
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,034
if she told you.

217
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,922
Come in.

218
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,930
Are you done?

219
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,515
One second.

220
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,726
Honey.

221
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,644
Yes?

222
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,692
I forgot to ask you something earlier.

223
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,361
What is it?

224
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,698
It's about that day.

225
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,118
The day of Ji-hoon's accident.

226
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,916
What kind of

227
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,461
trouble was he in?

228
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,506
What?

229
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,426
You said he had to see you
because he got in trouble.

230
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,097
What did he do?

231
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,433
It wasn't a big deal.

232
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,893
What was it?

233
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,312
Drugs?

234
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:56,856
Or raping Soo-bin?

235
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,526
No.

236
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:03,238
It was just an excuse.

237
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,990
He wanted money.

238
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,702
Money?

239
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,580
Yes.

240
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,251
Did he blackmail you
into giving him money?

241
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,504
Just like Soo-bin did?

242
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,975
Did Ji-hoon blackmail you
just like Soo-bin did

243
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,271
saying he'd expose your affair?

244
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,028
What?

245
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,382
Honey.

246
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:06,635
Did you meet Kim Soo-bin again?

247
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,346
Did she tell you some nonsense again?

248
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,015
Are you…

249
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,436
Are you and Yeo-jin…

250
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:19,356
really having an affair?

251
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,440
Me and Yeo-jin?

252
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,609
That's ridiculous, Hye-joo.

253
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,777
Lower your voice.

254
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,737
Yoon-seo is upstairs.

255
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,366
Ji-hoon had told Soo-bin

256
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,118
that he was going to meet you

257
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,122
and tell you he knew everything
and you needed to stop.

258
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,168
You said you met him that day.

259
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:44,506
And Ji-hoon

260
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,468
died right after meeting you.

261
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,556
Hye-joo.

262
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:57,185
Just what are you accusing me of?

263
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,271
Are you sure what I just said…

264
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,733
wasn't the reason

265
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,154
-he needed to see you?
-No, it wasn't.

266
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,281
Why do you trust her
more than me, Hye-joo?

267
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,493
Is that so?

268
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,163
Was I fooled by Soo-bin again?

269
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,506
Okay then.

270
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,175
I'll check with Yeo-jin.

271
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,605
Good.

272
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,275
I was just coming to see you.

273
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,903
Come in.

274
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:56,077
Let's talk inside.

275
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,412
Yoon-seo is upstairs.

276
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,933
If I'm talking crazy, just tell me.

277
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:21,436
Is there…

278
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,024
really something going on between you two?

279
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,158
Answer me.

280
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,868
Yes.

281
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,413
What?

282
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,336
-No.
-Yes.

283
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,962
Are you insane?

284
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,883
Hye-joo, it's not true.

285
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:53,009
It is.

286
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,806
There is something going on.

287
00:25:58,389 --> 00:25:59,766
What's wrong with you?

288
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,771
Hye-joo, let's talk in private.

289
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,897
Get out.

290
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,153
I want both of you
out of this house right now.

291
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,088
Pardon?

292
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,465
What did she find out?

293
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,010
That time.

294
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,556
Kim Soo-bin showed up

295
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,726
and said she was aware
of your affair with Ms. Hyeon

296
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,352
and asked for money?

297
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,271
Yes, it's all crazy nonsense.

298
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,483
But things can get messy
if she runs her mouth.

299
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,111
Find her a place to stay.

300
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,073
Yes, sir.

301
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,494
<i><font color="white">What Kim Soo-bin said is…</font></i>

Don't worry about Kim Soo-bin.

306
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,354
Whatever she says,

307
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,105
we can just deny it.

308
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,902
<i><font color="white">Please just keep an eye on Ms. Kim.</font></i>

Ms. Kim.

315
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:22,023
Hello.

316
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,317
How come you two are coming together?

317
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,862
-We met on the bus.
-I see.

318
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,031
What are you looking at?

319
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:34,827
PASS NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW
TRUTH MUST BE REVEALED!

320
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:40,249
But that online post
about Assemblyman Nam's wife

321
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,251
goes directly against that law.

322
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,169
I know.

323
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:45,838
They haven't made
a statement yet, have they?

324
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,964
No.

325
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,139
Let's hope the tables will turn

326
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,099
after Ms. Kim's TV appearance tonight.

327
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,809
Yes.

328
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,394
As long as that goes well,

329
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,273
her past will play a big part
in publicizing Namgoong Sol's Law.

330
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,859
Let's go.

331
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,409
Assemblyman Kang.

332
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,329
That bill won't pass, will it?

333
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,999
If it actually passes
with the public's support,

334
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,126
the Daehan Party will get all cocky,

335
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,212
saying the citizens are on their side.

336
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,423
Don't worry about that.

337
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:32,927
Even the Daehan Party
is divided on that bill.

338
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,555
So why should we worry?

339
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,224
Are they not supporting it?

340
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:42,812
But Nam Joong-do is one of
Woo Jin-seok's closest associates,

341
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:47,149
and she's so vocal about
severe punishment for sex crimes.

342
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,444
I'll be resuming your shave.

343
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,321
Excuse me.

344
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,619
I understand.

345
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,455
If the party won't help me,

346
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,750
I'll handle Namgoong Sol's law on my own.

347
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,225
What did the Nation and People's Party…

348
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,978
No, what did
Assemblyman Kang offer in return?

349
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,483
Assemblyman Nam.

350
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,112
Who are you in politics for?

351
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,034
In my case,

352
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,869
I'm in it for the citizens,

353
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,079
not for the Daehan Party.

354
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,625
I guess your definition of "citizens"

355
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,962
doesn't include sex crime victims
whose assailants have killed themselves.

356
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,448
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

357
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:19,825
<i><font color="white">It's Choi Ki-young.</font></i>

358
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,079
<i><font color="white">I just emailed you the evidence.
Please check.</font></i>

359

Hello.

360
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,670
Welcome.

361
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:41,972
I JUST EMAILED YOU THE EVIDENCE.
PLEASE CHECK.

362
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:48,604
Me?

363
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:50,523
A news interview?

364
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:53,693
Yes, I already did mine outside.

365
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,944
Yes, ma'am.

366
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,572
We just need you to share with us
how much you've been suffering

367
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,825
since the loss of your son.

368
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,386
You two were

369
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,014
the first family I ever had in my life.

370
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,894
I learned that family
isn't just about blood

371
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,354
thanks to you two.

372
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,486
How could you do this to me?

373
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,992
What went through your mind
every day when you saw me?

374
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,173
I'll give you two hours.

375
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:00,050
Pack up your things and leave.

376
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,655
Right.

377
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,116
The post on the internet.

378
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,953
Yes.

379
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,456
My wife is all right.

380
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,543
I heard about Ms. Kim from a customer.

381
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,338
I was just so worried.

382
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,883
Yes, everything will be resolved soon.

383
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,053
Thank you for your concern.

384
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,722
Yes, goodbye.

385
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,409
HUSBAND

386
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,592
What?

387
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,719
About the news appearance tonight.

388
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,848
I'll send you a car later.

389
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:34,186
It seems like

390
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,314
I really didn't know you at all.

391
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:42,236
Do you really think
I'll still go on the news with you?

392
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,196
We're doing this for your sake.

393
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:46,740
And this is unrelated.

394
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,243
<i><font color="white">Please consider it so.</font></i>

395
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,829
<i><font color="white">And about what happened…</font></i>

396
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,540
Let's talk about it tonight.

397
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,833
<i><font color="white">Let me ask you something.</font></i>

398
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,421
When you said Soo-bin blackmailed you
saying Ji-hoon raped her,

399
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,006
you were lying, weren't you?

400
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,721
Yes.

401
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,639
<i><font color="white">I'm sorry.</font></i>

402
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,811
How can you do this?

403
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,440
I know I've wronged you and Ji-hoon.

404
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:23,027
But it was for Namgoong Sol's Law.

405
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,321
Have you lost your mind?

406
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,325
How could you do this to Ji-hoon?

407
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,828
Don't you know what people said about him
after your press conference?

408
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,205
I do.

409
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,125
But it was inevitable
for the greater good.

410
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,669
<i><font color="white">This wasn't easy for me either.</font></i>

411
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,046
<i><font color="white">Ji-hoon is my son.</font></i>

412
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,507
Are you sure he wasn't
just one of your tools?

413
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,052
Hye-joo.

414
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,850
Ji-hoon died…

415
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:01,523
right after he met you
on the banks of the Han River.

416
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,487
<i><font color="white">Do you really have nothing
to do with his death?</font></i>

417
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,530
Hye-joo.

418
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,033
That's absolutely not it.

419
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,456
I can't go on the news with you.

420
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,874
<i><font color="white">No, I won't.</font></i>

421
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,085
<i><font color="white">If you're telling me</font></i>

422
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,838
that I have to be on the news with you
after you used my son like that,

423
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,507
you're a real piece of shit.

424
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:44,900
Mr. Jang.

425
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,177
You should go on the news
with or without her.

426
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,104
Jang Woo-jae.

427
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,398
Yes, sir.

428
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,151
On the day

429
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,153
of Ji-hoon's accident…

430
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,699
Take this.

431
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,633
HYE-JOO
I'M AT THE POLICE STATION

432
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:54,762
<i><font color="white">I think Yoon-seo ran away from home.</font></i>

<i><font color="white">I'm at the police station.</font></i>

434
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,142
Assemblyman Nam, how did it go?

435
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,436
I think Yoon-seo ran away.

436
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,396
Sorry?

437
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,149
Can you follow him?
Make sure he doesn't cause trouble.

438
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,569
I need to go see Hye-joo.

439
00:42:10,652 --> 00:42:11,528
Thank you.

440
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,825
Sir!

441
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:21,705
-Have you found her?
-Not yet.

442
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,666
I'll park the car

443
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,710
and look over there.

444
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,795
Thank you.

445
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,171
Wait.

446
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,006
Did you get Ji-hoon home?

447
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,050
I lost him.

448
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,302
He ran off. I'm sorry.

449
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,054
Don't worry about it.

450
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,181
-Then I'll search that way.
-Yes, sir.

451
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,934
<i><font color="white">You said you lost Ji-hoon.</font></i>

00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,651
-Yes.
-So tell me.

453
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,114
Did you meet him that night?

454
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:59,118
On the banks of the Han River?

455
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,045
I did.

456
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,467
Jang Woo-jae.

457
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:19,429
Did you…

458
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,392
kill him?

459
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,811
You know he took his own life.

460
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:26,937
No, he didn't.

461
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,941
He didn't kill himself.

462
00:43:31,024 --> 00:43:33,193
When I told him I got pregnant

463
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,196
on the phone that night,
he got pissed at my boyfriend.

464
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,532
He was ready to kill him.

465
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,325
There's no way he killed himself.

466
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:45,038
He was hammered that night
and there was heavy rain.

467
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,623
It could have been an accident,

468
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,917
but it definitely wasn't suicide.

469

with just eight months until the election.

If he's getting involved
with sex crime or drugs…

I'll get it under control at all costs.

Open the door right now.

I know you're in there.

Did you read what I wrote online?

Yes.

Seung-hee.

Why won't you believe anything I say?

why you ran off and lived in hiding?

540
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,694
You killed a person with your lie.

541
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,614
You ran away because you were guilty.

542
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,243
We were friends.

543
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,330
But from the beginning,

544
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,081
you were convinced that I was lying.

545
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,542
Has it never occurred to you

546
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,544
that Seung-ho might have lied?

547
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,050
Because he's family.

548
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,844
If I don't trust my family,
who else can I trust?

549
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,806
You probably don't know
because you didn't have one,

550
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,850
but that's what family is.

551
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,731
You lived in hiding all these years,

552
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,567
and now you're going after my husband?

553
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,903
Wasn't Seung-ho enough?

554
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:51,529
What?

555
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,532
You met Ki-young here
a couple of days ago.

556
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,329
Don't you dare try to lie to me again.

557
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:03,208
I've already checked
the dashcam and the GPS.

558
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:07,629
-Are you two having an affair?
-It's not like that.

559
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:08,713
Then what is it?

560
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,759
Tell me. What is it?

561
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:14,552
You just said it yourself.

562
00:50:15,553 --> 00:50:16,638
You trust your family.

563
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,767
You're right, I'm not your family.

564
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,936
But what about Ki-young?

565
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,982
Why can't you trust him? He's your family.

566
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,945
You have no idea.

567

Kim Jae-eun.

568
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,700
You've probably never feared

569
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,578
that your husband might leave you.

570
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,874
I'm different.

571
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:48,378
I've always been scared

572

that Ki-young might leave me.

573
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,135
I've wondered if I'm keeping him

574
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,595
in this suffocating family
against his will.

575
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,057
I've always been anxious.

576
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,601
<i><font color="white">I can't keep doing this.</font></i>

577
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,231
-Ki-young.
-Living here is

578
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,899
just too much for me.

579
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,609
I'm not happy here.

580
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,655
Seung-ho died because of you…

581
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,618
and I became utterly miserable.

582
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,413
So…

583
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,790
why do you get to be happy?

584
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,716
-Seung-hee.
-Kim Jae-eun.

585
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:40,347
I want you to be miserable,

586

just like me and my family.

587
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,687
That would be fair.

588
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:24,474
Ji-hoon was caught

589

590

Why would he do that?

I don't know.

593
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,781
But from the footage,

594
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,285
it looked like he drowned
while trying to retrieve the meth.
