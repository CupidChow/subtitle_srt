1
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,022
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

2
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:15,899
What did you say?

3
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:18,818
I'm pregnant.

4
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:22,947
-Excuse me?
-I'm…

5
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:25,867
pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby.

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,124
You're…

7
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:37,295
pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby?

8
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:39,297
Yes.

9
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:46,346
The police found a gram of methamphetamine

10
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,556
in the pocket of Assemblyman Nam's son

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,309
whose body was found 15 days ago.

12
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,771
According to Sinyang Police Station,

13
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,689
they found a small resealable bag

14
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:59,484
containing one gram of methamphetamine

15
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,194
as well as a burner phone.

16
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,279
To investigate the details of his death…

17
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,006
Oh, right.

18
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:29,347
Here.

19
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,017
No, you don't have to show me this.

20
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,063
And I also have this.

21
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:44,446
The pregnancy test kit can be inaccurate,

22
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:46,781
so I had a blood test
at the hospital yesterday.

23
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:51,703
This number means I'm five weeks pregnant,

24
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,621
so I got pregnant three weeks ago.

25
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,958
That's about ten days after
Ji-hoon's release,

26
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,336
and three or four days
before his accident.

27
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,049
I can't really pinpoint the exact date.

28
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,928
I said I'll take the sonogram next time.

29
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,895
And this is just my normal belly.

30
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,577
I should probably show you
a photo we took together,

31
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,747
but I lost my phone yesterday…

32
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,419
so I'll just tell you in words.

33
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,672
Ji-hoon and I really dated.

34
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:49,177
We met through mutual friends.

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,013
You recently got him
a studio apartment, right?

36
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:54,307
Unit 507, Ujeong Apartment. Split-level.

37
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,476
We stayed there together.

38
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,243
Did Ji-hoon know

39
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:15,787
that you were pregnant, Soo-bin?

40
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,665
No.

41
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,668
I only found out yesterday.

42
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,301
Were you at the funeral hall?

43
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,888
Yes, of course.

44
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,391
Sinyang Funeral Home. That huge hall.

45
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,770
I was a bit out of it on that day,

46
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,774
but I don't recall
seeing any of Ji-hoon's friends.

47
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,360
Nobody else came?

48
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:49,404
I can't believe them.

49
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:54,117
Don't worry about them.
They were probably all too shocked.

50
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:58,746
I went alone,
but I didn't sign the guest book.

51
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,540
It didn't feel right.

52
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,794
There were a lot of visitors.

53
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,880
I stood in line with strangers
and lit incense.

54
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,634
It's fine if you can't remember.

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,726
But I haven't been to his columbarium.

56
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,103
I don't know where it is.

57
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,107
Please take me with you next time.

58
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:32,405
I want to say goodbye to him.

59
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:38,578
Sure. Thank you.

60
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,169
So…

61
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,964
do your parents know about this situation?

62
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:52,508
No.

63
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:54,677
I don't have any parents.

64
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:56,304
Just like you.

65
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,769
Ji-hoon told me.

66
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,645
I didn't do any digging.

67
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,109
Speaking of which…

68
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:15,031
could you let me stay here?

69
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:24,165
THE ACCIDENT

70
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,379
Come on, please.

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,965
Can you call me? It's urgent.

72
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:42,183
ASSEMBLYMEN'S OFFICE

73
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:54,237
YEO-JIN

74
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,586
Would you like something to drink?

75
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,547
I have coffee…

76
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,882
Am I allowed to have coffee?

77
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,762
I'm not sure.
Some people have one cup a day.

78
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,891
Then I'll take juice or tea.

79
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,768
Just to be safe.

80
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:28,312
Sure.

81
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:02,513
GREAT ASSEMBLYMAN AWARD

82
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:03,765
Assemblyman Kang.

83
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:06,017
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG SOON-HONG

84
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:14,233
Goodness, look how incompetent he is.

85
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:17,779
He let his son's narcotics case
get exposed in the news?

86
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:22,200
"One must keep his home in peace
to reign the world in peace."

87
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:27,079
How can he manage state affairs

88
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:30,041
when he can't even bring up
his son properly?

89
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:34,128
-Hyeong-tae.
-Yes, sir.

90
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:37,507
Put on the National Assembly TV.

91
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,929
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party

92
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:46,182
must take responsibility for covering up
his eldest son's drug possession,

93
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,850
the suspicion of abuse

94
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,937
for the special favor he called in
for an investigation

95
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,981
at Sinyang Police Station,
and step down from his office.

96
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:56,442
A simple runaway case
involving his daughter

97
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:58,778
led to an emergency dispatch

98
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,863
of 30 violent crime unit detectives.

99
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,116
This is obviously an abuse of position
and power in his electoral district

100
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,661
by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

101
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,831
To our people, Assemblyman Nam Joong-do…

102
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,336
There's a lot of malicious comments
calling him a junkie.

103
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,629
We have no excuses.

104
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:17,839
I mean, methamphetamine?

105
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:22,009
I know I shouldn't speak ill of the dead,

106
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,221
but this is awful.
How are we going to patch this up?

107
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,474
Honestly, if it didn't end here,

108
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,017
he might have done something worse.

109
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,729
The Nation and People's Party
is probably thrilled right now.

110
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:37,817
They're conflating this
and his missing daughter's investigation.

111
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,236
Who would sit around and wait

112
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,864
when you can't reach
your teenage daughter all night?

113
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:44,407
We pay taxes and have police stations

114
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,159
so that they can help us
when our kids go missing.

115
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:48,536
And how could they do this…

116
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,248
to someone who just lost his son?

117
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,000
They're just awful.

118
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,337
We're in Yeouido.
You know how it is in politics.

119
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:09,724
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

120
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,945
NEW MESSAGES
MISSED CALLS

121
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:34,498
Hello, Chief.

122
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:47,803
Is there something you want to say to me?

123
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,391
Well, by any chance…

124
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,268
Yes?

125
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,730
Did Ji-hoon…

126
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,747
Hello.

127
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,917
Nice to meet you.

128
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:25,883
You lost your phone,

129
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,552
so you don't have any photos of him
or text messages?

130
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:31,764
Then how are we supposed to believe

131
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,392
that you and Ji-hoon were
in a relationship?

132
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,854
I already explained everything to her.

133
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,857
Do you want me to make a drawing
of his apartment unit?

134
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,860
That's information
that all his other friends could have.

135
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,362
I lived there with him.

136
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,909
Ji-hoon got into this incident
fifteen days after his release.

137
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,371
I think it's an exaggeration

138
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:59,291
to say you lived with him
after spending 15 days together.

139
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,212
Fifteen days aren't that short.

140
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,090
We did everything we possibly could.

141
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,221
You may not have met your parents
after their divorce,

142
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,347
but you have their numbers, right?

143
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,557
No.

144
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,308
I don't even know where they live.

145
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:18,436
Do you have any other guardians?

146
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,563
There aren't any.

147
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,900
I'm an adult. I'm not a teenager.

148
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,862
I don't even know your age.

149
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:30,364
How old are you? What about school?

150
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:31,657
I was born in 2001.

151
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,994
The same as Ji-hoon. I'm 22.

152
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,871
I dropped out of Seongseol High.

153
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:40,124
And I wasn't expelled.

154
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,625
I just didn't want to go.

155
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,092
Will you

156
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,136
have the baby?

157
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,850
I don't know. What should I do?

158
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:00,603
My goodness.

159
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,605
Hye-joo.

160
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,106
Did you hear that?

161
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:05,816
You did, right?

162
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:07,443
Unbelievable.

163
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:18,913
His blood tested negative
for blood tests for illegal drugs,

164
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:23,042
but his blood alcohol level was
at a level of acute alcohol intoxication.

165
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,045
-I see.
-I tried not to let the news get out

166
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,339
about your son's drug possession, but…

167
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,008
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:31,967
It's okay.

169
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,221
I didn't expect it to be hidden forever.

170
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,390
But Assemblyman Nam.

171
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:41,477
Narcotics made a series
of arrests recently,

172
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,314
and they discovered a connection
to your son's burner phone.

173
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,943
And according to a confession,
one of the drop-off points

174
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,946
includes a restroom
on the bank of the Han River.

175
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:55,574
And your son was caught on the camera…

176
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:04,959
at the entrance of the restroom.

177
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:40,035
You haven't heard from Joong-do yet?

178
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,539
No, I left him a message,
but he hasn't called. He must be busy.

179
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,749
So I haven't called again.

180
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,502
Right. He'll be home later anyway.

181
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,928
Yeo-jin, excuse me.

182
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:01,765
Hey, Yoon-seo.

183
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,811
Right, okay.

184
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:17,114
Who's Yoon-seo?

185
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:21,410
I'm guessing Ji-hoon never told you
about his younger sister.

186
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,164
I see.

187
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,965
I don't know why
they found it in his pocket,

188
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,384
but I'm sure that it wasn't his.

189
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:39,261
Everything is okay with Dad too,

190
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,139
so focus on your class,
and come straight home afterward.

191
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,140
Okay?

192
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:45,351
Come straight home.

193
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,191
NEWS

194
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:57,404
NAM PRESSED TO RESIGN
DUE TO SCANDAL SURROUNDING HIS CHILDREN

195
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,997
I'm pleased that
we were able to build new roads

196
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:08,499
for Seonghan District 2

197
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:10,876
as part of the public redevelopment plan.

198
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,755
The residents here
have suffered long enough

199
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:18,425
because of the deteriorating
roads and buildings.

200
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:19,718
-Yes.
-He's right.

201
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:23,097
The project was delayed
because it lacked business potential.

202
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:26,183
Let me pour you a glass.

203
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:28,852
Assemblyman Nam, allow me to pour you one.

204
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:31,105
-Goodness.
-There's no need for formalities.

205
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:33,023
Goodness, thank you.

206
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:36,694
Thank you for joining us for a meeting
despite the circumstances.

207
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,862
Of course, I should be here. Thank you.

208
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:40,572
Cheer up, Assemblyman Nam.

209
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,449
Thank you.

210
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,534
Sure thing.

211
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:44,743
He can really drink.

212
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,787
-Let me pour you one.
-Thank you.

213
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:49,373
RESERVATIONS
ROOM 1, JICHEONG HIGH, 41ST CLASS

214
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,624
It must have been tough.

215
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,294
You could use a drink.

216
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,254
Thanks for coming.

217
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:59,133
Work is important,
but come out and meet us too.

218
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:01,010
-Sure.
-Cheers.

219
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,637
-To Jicheong High!
-Jicheong High!

220
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,435
You've got to meet people.

221
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,061
STOP LYING. WE KNOW IT WAS METH.
R.I.P. MR. JUNKIE

222
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:12,521
Everything will be fine.

223
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,982
-To Jicheong High!
-Jicheong High!

224
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,152
We're meeting again next time.

225
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,653
Of course.

226
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:21,280
-Joong-do.
-See you later.

227
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,449
Let's grab a drink soon.

228
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,242
-Okay, I'll be in touch.
-Okay.

229
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:27,286
-Please drive safely.
-Sure.

230
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:28,495
Let's go.

231
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,249
Please get the car ready.

232
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,049
Are you all right, sir?

233
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:41,717
I'm fine.

234
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:16,794
Ms. Kim.

235
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:20,589
She's coming.

236
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,136
Hello.

237
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,763
-Hello.
-Hello.

238
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:31,600
Assemblyman Nam had
a little too much to drink today.

239
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,852
He rarely does that.

240
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:36,063
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

241
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:37,815
Let me escort him inside.

242
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:38,816
Actually, Woo-jae…

243
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,579
So?

244
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:54,832
What does she want?

245
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,585
She wants a place to stay.
She has nowhere to go.

246
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:05,968
What about the baby? What's her plan?

247
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,555
She doesn't know yet.

248
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:12,349
She doesn't know?

249
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,145
She must be a bit confused about it all.

250
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,522
She's young

251
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,150
and her pregnancy was out of the blue.

252
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,278
And…

253
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:27,156
Ji-hoon isn't around either.

254
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:33,996
But honey.

255
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,374
As for the baby,

256
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,711
whatever she decides to do with her baby,

257
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:44,381
we don't have any right
to tell her what to do.

258
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:45,424
You know that, right?

259
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,676
I know.

260
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,927
I do…

261
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:53,390
but even so, she barged in and asked you
to let her stay without any plans?

262
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,643
I told you. She has no money
and nowhere to go.

263
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,979
If we let her stay for a few days,

264
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:01,482
she'll figure out what to do.

265
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:07,196
I'll tell her she can stay for--

266
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,489
No, send her elsewhere.

267
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,033
Can you look into it?

268
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:13,827
Elsewhere? Why?

269
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,787
I don't want her.

270
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,333
-You don't want her?
-No, I don't.

271
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,502
I don't want her in our home.

272
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,504
Wait.

273
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,216
I mean, honey.

274
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,720
She's pregnant with Ji-hoon's child

275
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,347
and she had nowhere to go.

276
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,808
And you want me to send her away
just because you don't want her?

277
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,395
Why do you want to let her stay so badly?

278
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:49,363
She just reminds me of myself.

279
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,785
She has no parents, no money,
and nowhere to go.

280
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,453
YEONGSAN TO GANGNAM

281
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:58,497
It reminds me of myself…

282
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,625
What took you so long?

283
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,378
-…when I first came to Seoul.
-Goodness.

284
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,927
I know how it feels to be alone

285
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,763
with nobody to depend on.

286
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,267
How can I tell her to go elsewhere
when I have a perfectly fine home?

287
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,943
And I was just her age
when I had Yoon-seo.

288
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,945
At least I had you then.

289
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,365
But she's completely alone.

290
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:37,744
Do you believe her?

291
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:40,622
That Ji-hoon is the father?

292
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:43,792
Honey.

293
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,712
How can you believe her? Can she prove it?

294
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,922
No, right?

295
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:51,216
So how can you believe her?

296
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:56,013
What about you?

297
00:20:57,598 --> 00:21:00,392
How do you know Yoon-seo is your daughter?

298
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:18,660
Hello.

299
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:20,203
Nice to meet you.

300
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:23,498
Honey.

301
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,471
Is Ji-hoon really the father?

302
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,765
Honey.

303
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:46,563
Don't lie to me. Is it true?

304
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,775
Yes.

305
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:54,446
Honey, let's talk tomorrow.
You had too much to drink.

306
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,407
Do you want to know
when, where, and how we did it?

307
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,327
Or whether he was any good?

308
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:07,250
I guess you don't want to believe it.

309
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:09,044
Fine.

310
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:10,504
I understand.

311
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:14,341
I'll get an abortion.

312
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:18,553
-Wait…
-I heard it's not illegal anymore.

313
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:22,265
It'll look great on the news too.

314
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,185
I had a kid with an assemblyman's son,

315
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:27,187
but they kicked me out of their house.

316
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:29,981
Interesting, right?

317
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,071
Hey.

318
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:38,532
Yoon-seo.

319
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:40,534
-Watch what you say.
-Yoon-seo.

320
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:43,161
My dad isn't someone
you can talk to like that.

321
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:46,123
And the same goes for Nam Ji-hoon.

322
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:48,583
-No matter how big of a scumbag he was--
-Scumbag?

323
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,002
Hey.

324
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:59,136
I never thought he was a scumbag.

325
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,140
That's why I'm in this mess.

326
00:23:04,474 --> 00:23:05,475
This mess?

327
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,354
Yes, you got into this mess
because you live like that.

328
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:11,064
-That's enough, Yoon-seo.
-You're right.

329
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,026
And that's why Nam Ji-hoon
ended up like that.

330
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:17,028
-Soo-bin.
-What?

331
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,114
Hey, are you done?

332
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,616
-Yoon-seo, what's with you?
-Let go of me, Mom!

333
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,743
-You crazy bitch.
-That's enough, Yoon-seo.

334
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:26,329
Do you even hear yourself?
You got him into drugs, didn't you?

335
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,123
-It was yours, isn't it?
-Drugs?

336
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,708
-Yoon-seo.
-Yes, drugs!

337
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,335
They found meth on Ji-hoon.
Wasn't it yours?

338
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:33,503
It wasn't me.

339
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:34,504
It really wasn't me.

340
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:36,840
I don't know anything about that.

341
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:38,800
-Stop pretending!
-Nam Yoon-seo!

342
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:41,303
I told you to stop.

343
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:43,722
You should also watch it.

344
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:45,932
Dad.

345
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,851
She's just a crazy bitch.

346
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,603
So just kick her out now.

347
00:23:49,686 --> 00:23:51,688
Yoon-seo, cut it out and go upstairs.

348
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,232
-Yeo-jin, can you take her?
-Yoon-seo, let's go up--

349
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:57,819
-No, I'm not going up.
-That's enough! The adults are talking!

350
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:58,737
Why?

351
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,906
Why do I have to stay out of it?

352
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:03,366
I'm a part of this family too.
I'm Ji-hoon's sister!

353
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,577
-Nam Yoon-seo!
-To be frank,

354
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,997
I used to wish
that he would die all the time.

355
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,042
He always ended up on the news
and got in Dad's way

356
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,293
and broke your heart.

357
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:15,086
So I wished…

358
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:19,257
that he would just die all the time.

359
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,384
But…

360
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,846
But I didn't think he actually would.

361
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:36,691
You said that he was a scumbag yourself.

362
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,822
Yes, and you're pregnant
with a scumbag's kid.

363
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:44,449
-Congratulations.
-Nam Yoon-seo!

364
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,159
That's enough, Nam Yoon-seo!

365
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,246
Why?

366
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:51,164
Why are you yelling at me?

367
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,598
That's enough.

368
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,143
It doesn't matter if what you say is true.

369
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:14,938
This is Ji-hoon's home,
and they're his family.

370
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,483
Are you here to blackmail them?

371
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,277
You're not.

372
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,113
But if you keep running your mouth
like you are right now,

373
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:25,073
that's what you'd be doing.

374
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:28,076
But that's not you.

375
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,371
You got pregnant while dating him,

376
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:33,540
and Ji-hoon got into
an unfortunate accident.

377
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,376
That's why you came to his parents' house.

378
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:39,337
You didn't have any ulterior motives.

379
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,964
Right?

380
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,738
You can stay in Ji-hoon's room for now.

381
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:08,575
This is the bathroom.

382
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:09,701
And his room is…

383
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,335
this way. Follow me.

384
00:26:32,182 --> 00:26:33,183
Yes?

385
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:40,065
Here.

386
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:44,944
I'm not sure if these clothes will fit.

387
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,786
My room is right across from you,
so let me know if you need anything.

388
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:55,205
Okay.

389
00:26:58,124 --> 00:26:59,250
Get some rest, then.

390
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:07,258
Actually, there's something
I meant to ask you.

391
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,553
Sure.

392
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:13,139
By any chance, did Ji-hoon…

393
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:20,271
force you in any way without your consent?

394
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,197
Did he force himself on me?

395
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:33,618
No, it wasn't like that.

396
00:27:36,037 --> 00:27:38,206
Ji-hoon wasn't that low.

397
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,251
If he had, I would be at a police station.

398
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,715
Right.

399
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,093
Okay, then. Get some rest.

400
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:46,107
Please head inside.
I'm going to have a smoke.

401
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:49,235
May I have one too?

402
00:28:58,661 --> 00:29:00,080
I didn't know you smoked.

403
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,500
I quit on the day of the ruling.

404
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,837
It felt so unfair
that I wanted to live long.

405
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,730
It's been a while since we saw
each other over Ji-hoon's case.

406
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:28,233
It was so hectic
that I didn't even get to say hi.

407
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:31,236
-Have you been well?
-Yes, I'm all right.

408
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,864
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

409
00:29:37,784 --> 00:29:39,828
What should we do with her?

410
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,163
She doesn't know
if she'll have the baby or not.

411
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,210
If she wants an abortion,

412
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:50,797
we just have to make sure
we didn't pressure her, and that's it.

413
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:54,509
Don't look for a hospital
or pay for her fees.

414
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,302
We can't have anything to do with it.

415
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,221
Okay.

416
00:29:58,304 --> 00:29:59,973
But what if she wants to keep it?

417
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:02,642
That's not bad news for Assemblyman Nam.

418
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,563
It could be used
to appeal to the pro-life side.

419
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:09,190
As you know,

420
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:13,403
you never know which side's votes
you'll need in politics.

421
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,364
If we need their votes, we'll use that.

422
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:20,702
And if she gives birth,
leaves the baby here,

423
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,579
and Ms. Kim ends up raising him,

424
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:25,874
that will be an even better story.

425
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,084
It will be a touching story.

426
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:35,049
It seems like you're all ready
for the general election.

427
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,426
The general election?

428
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,343
I guess so.

429
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:40,263
This general election,
and the one after this…

430
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:42,432
I should be prepared.

431
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,938
I'll take it. I'll throw it out at home.

432
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:50,398
It's all right. Right here.

433
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,276
I can put it in here.

434
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,904
You carry that around too?

435
00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:06,748
The moment any evidence is left behind,
I'll become a lawbreaker.

436
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,626
I can't hold Assemblyman Nam back

437
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,086
from doing great work in the future.

438
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:15,590
I'm saying all kinds of nonsense today.

439
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:17,634
I'll get going.

440
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:19,469
-Goodbye, then.
-Get home safely.

441
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:28,353
You should make that your last cigarette.

442
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:31,397
You should live a long life.

443
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,523
Goodbye.

444
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:03,221
Too many things are
happening to us lately.

445
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,143
I saw the news earlier.

446
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,438
They say you received special favor
in the investigation.

447
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,566
You don't need to worry about it.

448
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:18,945
That will blow over soon.

449
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,531
It's not a big deal.

450
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:29,372
Right.

451
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:33,042
Take that girl to a hospital
and get her tested for drugs.

452
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:34,836
Drugs?

453
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,047
Drug testing is mandatory for teachers,
and a lot of hospitals do it.

454
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:41,718
Call and find a hospital
that reports same-day results.

455
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:44,095
Do we really have to go that far?

456
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,683
You saw how alarmed she was
when Yoon-seo mentioned drugs.

457
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:50,601
It wasn't her.

458
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:56,024
Think rationally.

459
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:58,860
You'll want to believe she's a good girl,

460
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,528
but it's only because our situation is…

461
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,866
so shitty.

462
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,661
You just don't want things
to get any worse.

463
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:11,039
Think about this rationally.

464
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,416
She's a total stranger we've never met.

465
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:16,502
And you want to let
a complete stranger sleep here.

466
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,757
You and I were total strangers at first.

467
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,675
Everyone is a stranger at first.

468
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,302
She's not just a stranger!

469
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:27,138
She's one of Ji-hoon's friends.

470
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,475
Did you forget what he was like?

471
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,769
He sunk so low as to buy drugs!

472
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:35,229
Thankfully, he hadn't used them yet,

473
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,898
but don't you think he would have

474
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:40,026
if it wasn't for the accident?

475
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,697
And even if Ji-hoon
didn't get the drugs from her,

476
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,866
how do we know that she isn't a junkie?

477
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:50,536
She's pregnant right now, honey.

478
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,288
Try visiting a prison.

479
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,291
There are tons of pregnant drug offenders.

480
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:10,640
That's just who our son was.

481
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:13,851
Someone with meth in their pocket.

482
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,438
At the very least,
he associated with others like that.

483
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,524
That's the fact.

484
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:24,362
Just face the truth like it is,

485
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:27,990
although I'm sure
you didn't think of him like that.

486
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:39,794
You should go to bed.

487
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,352
By any chance, did Ji-hoon…

488
00:34:57,353 --> 00:35:01,691
force you in any way without your consent?

489
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:09,699
No, it wasn't like that.

490
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:14,287
Ji-hoon wasn't that low.

491
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,792
Although I'm sure
you didn't think of him like that.

492
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:15,515
How do you know Yoon-seo is your daughter?

493
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:18,309
Because it's you.

494
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,979
Because I trust you.

495
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:25,024
But you see,

496
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,361
I don't trust anyone else
but you, Hye-joo.

497
00:38:57,718 --> 00:38:59,220
-Hello.
-Did you get a good night's sleep?

498
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,846
-Yes.
-Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

499
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,140
Reporter Jung Gyeong-eun of SBC.

500
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:05,393
What do you have to say
about the allegations of you

501
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,103
-receiving favor from the Sinyang Police?
-Hey.

502
00:39:07,186 --> 00:39:08,771
You need to schedule an interview.

503
00:39:21,784 --> 00:39:23,369
-Stop filming.
-When did you

504
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:25,371
first learn of your son's drug possession?

505
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:27,581
If you had known, did you cover it up?

506
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:31,293
Then this seems relevant
to the special favor you received.

507
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:34,088
-Well, that's…
-That's not it!

508
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,092
-Honey.
-You're wrong.

509
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,009
Are you his wife?

510
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:40,761
What do you mean?

511
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,806
-Honey.
-Are you denying the possession

512
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:45,850
or the favor from the police station?

513
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:47,893
You can ask me. Honey, don't answer that.

514
00:39:47,977 --> 00:39:50,229
Don't film her! Ms. Kim, please go inside.

515
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:52,565
I did it.

516
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:55,025
He didn't want to,

517
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:56,736
but I asked the police

518
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:58,696
-to get more detectives out there.
-Honey.

519
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,073
It's true. Why won't you say it?

520
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:06,245
-Ji-hoon is dead.
-Honey.

521
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:08,664
I don't care what people say.
He's our precious son.

522
00:40:08,748 --> 00:40:11,083
What do you want to hear from us?

523
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,794
-Honey. Go inside.
-Are you admitting to receiving a favor?

524
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:14,837
You'll wake Yoon-seo.

525
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,506
-Now.
-Honey.

526
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,050
Do you admit to the allegation
of the special favor?

527
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:22,595
-That's enough!
-Give me an answer!

528
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:25,222
-That's enough. Stop filming.
-I'm sorry.

529
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:27,975
I'll answer that formally later.

530
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,226
-I'm sorry.
-Let's go.

PERILLA OIL (UNROASTED)

533
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:46,929
Do I know you?

534
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,807
Right. You came by the mill yesterday.

535
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,309
-Following the allegations of…
-When will she come by?

536
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:54,687
We visited his home for a statement…

537
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,606
-I don't even know her name…
-…but did not get a clear explanation.

538
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,775
-Reporter Jung Gyeong-eun will take over.
-…or her phone number.

539
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:01,318
After SBC's exclusive report

540
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:05,155
on the two suspicions
regarding his children…

541
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,824
-You can ask me.
-SBC wanted to know

542
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:08,367
-his position regarding the allegations.
-Honey, don't answer that.

543
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,703
-Gosh, Assemblyman Nam.
-What do you want to hear from us?

544
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:12,371
Assemblyman Nam and his wife, Kim…

545
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:15,165
-Goodness.
-…both were busy denying the charges.

546
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,586
-Assemblyman Nam's wife…
-She was his wife.

547
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,880
-…had made the following statement…
-My goodness.

548
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:41,650
Have some breakfast.

549
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:43,569
Hye-joo wants to stay in bed.

550
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:45,571
She has a headache, so keep quiet.

551
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:49,158
-Okay.
-Wash the dishes when you're done.

CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

553
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,737
Not long ago, in Sinyang-gu, Seoul,
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do's district,

554
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,615
a woman in her twenties took her own life

555
00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:33,077
after her boyfriend threatened
to distribute an intimate video.

556
00:43:33,702 --> 00:43:36,330
Regarding the death
of Assemblyman Nam's son,

557
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:40,000
there were 256 news articles reported
in a single day.

558
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:43,379
However, there were
only three news reports about the suicide

559
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:45,255
-of this woman--
-Nonsense!

560
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:49,510
Ma'am, you can't jump in.

561
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,261
-What's wrong?
-How dare you say that?

562
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:54,974
Sorry? Who are you, ma'am?

563
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:58,310
I am the grandmother of that dead girl!

564
00:43:58,394 --> 00:43:59,603
I'm sorry?

565
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,690
The girl who took her own life!

566
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:05,901
I'm her grandmother!

567
00:44:08,737 --> 00:44:10,823
Right, ma'am.

568
00:44:10,906 --> 00:44:12,700
It must have been hard for you.

569
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,494
Could you do an interview with me?

570
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:18,706
The accidental death
of an assemblyman's son is

571
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,125
all over the news, but--

572
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,335
Don't talk
about Assemblyman Nam like that!

573
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:29,258
He paid respect
at my granddaughter's funeral hall.

574
00:44:29,842 --> 00:44:32,469
Assemblyman Nam paid a visit?

575
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:36,890
He must have visited
to cover up the controversy

576
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,018
-surrounding his special treatment.
-Cover what up?

577
00:44:40,686 --> 00:44:43,981
The assemblyman visited
my granddaughter's funeral

578
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:47,693
even before he knew of his son's death!

579
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:50,446
Before that? Are you sure?

580
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:53,532
I may be old, but I can remember that!

581
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:57,077
He came on the first day
the funeral hall was open.

582
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,789
And his wife came by too!

583
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,375
His wife too?

584
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:05,627
My goodness.

585
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:09,131
How can you dare to say
something so atrocious

586
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:11,633
about parents
who have lost their precious child?

587
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:15,095
How can you even call yourself human?

588
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:18,640
-Ma'am. Please, I'm sorry.
-Goodness.

589
00:45:18,724 --> 00:45:20,809
-Help her.
-Goodness.

590
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:23,187
-Ma'am, please.
-How can you do this?

591
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,271
Yes.

592
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,483
Okay.

593
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,486
All right.

00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,547
-Goodness.
-They're taking this too far.

598
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,967
-You should report on facts!
-No one even showed up

to my granddaughter's funeral.

600
00:45:56,261 --> 00:45:57,721
She didn't even check the facts.

601
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:01,725
But Assemblyman Nam and his wife came,

602
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,271
so I felt less lonely and reassured.

603

In over 70 years of my life…

604
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:13,070
-Come in.
-…I've never seen an assemblyman like him.

605
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:16,031
Sir, I purchased a new badge.

Come in.

No, I was just wondering
what you were doing.

I see.

ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO'S STATEMENT

619
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:05,724
As for my son's purchase of illegal drugs…

620
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,769
I admit it's true.

621
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:11,897
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
about the special favor

622
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,232
I received while looking for
my missing daughter.

623
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,902
When I heard that she went missing,

624
00:48:17,486 --> 00:48:19,571
I had the toughest night of my life.

625
00:48:20,072 --> 00:48:23,116
When I couldn't find her
even after 12 hours,

626
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,702
I failed to make the right choice

627
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:27,913
and became an emotional parent.

628
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,707
I apologize.

629
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,338
But I am not sitting here today

630
00:48:36,922 --> 00:48:39,007
just to make an apology.

Assemblyman Nam?

633
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:03,615
I plead with you to take note of

in Sinyang-gu, where I live,

636
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:13,792
a woman in her 20s took her own life

637
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:17,587
because her ex-boyfriend
threatened that he'd distribute

638
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:19,131
an intimate video of them.

639
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,176
Despite this tragic incident,

640
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,387
the prosecution refused
to arrest the perpetrator

641
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,347
because he's a medical student
at a prestigious university,

642
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,683
-and is unlikely to flee.
-Thank you.

643
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:33,270
The prosecution rate
of digital sexual violence is

644
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:35,272
exceedingly low compared to other crimes.

645
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:37,357
Even when it is prosecuted,

646
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,234
most are merely fined or put on probation

647
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:41,987
because it's their first offense
or they showed remorse.

648
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:45,073
Only three percent were arrested.

649
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:47,617
Only three percent.

650
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:50,704
That is why

651
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:54,958
I am here to make a promise
before the citizens of Korea.

652
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:57,127
I will reorganize

653
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,796
and strengthen the legislation

654
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:02,799
so that digital sexual violence
can be properly punished.

655
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,677
I promise you.

656
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:10,807
Assemblyman Nam.

657
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:15,228
This may be a sensitive question,

658
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,105
but I began to wonder

659
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:20,150
if you are using someone else's tragedy

660
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:23,820
to cover up the controversy
over the special treatment

661
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:25,072
that you received.

662
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,163
I am here today

663
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:36,666
to apologize
for all controversies surrounding me,

664
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:39,753
and also to use my position

665
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,048
as an assemblyman
for the underprivileged in our society.

666
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:49,054
I've been under public scrutiny
because of recent controversies,

667
00:50:49,137 --> 00:50:51,681
so I thought I might use this opportunity

668
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:56,978
to speak directly
to our citizens watching at home.

669
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:01,858
Thank you.

670
00:51:02,484 --> 00:51:03,693
I believe

671
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:07,322
this is the last present
my late son has given me.

672
00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:10,700
An opportunity to settle the controversies

673
00:51:11,284 --> 00:51:13,120
that my son and I have created.

674
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,122
But above all else,

675
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:19,292
I believe that this is
what I need to do as an assemblyman

676
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:23,130
who the people of this country voted for.

677
00:51:28,426 --> 00:51:29,636
That is why

678
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:34,683
I will resolve the low indictment rate
of digital sexual violence

679
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:38,728
and ensure that all perpetrators
are properly punished

680
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,148
through reinforced legislation.

681
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:43,900
I promise you.

682
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,194
Also…

683
00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:48,905
I hope no parents in Korea

684
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,742
will ever experience
the heartbreak of losing a child,

685
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,454
as the young woman's family…

686
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,250
and I have

687
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,086
experienced.

688
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:07,090
I see.

689
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:10,010
I truly hope your personal tragedy becomes

690
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:14,264
the seed to building a hopeful future
for our society.

691
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:20,103
That was Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of Daehan Party.

692
00:52:20,187 --> 00:52:21,146
Thank you.

693
00:52:21,813 --> 00:52:24,316
Assemblyman Nam shared his position

694
00:52:24,399 --> 00:52:26,026
on the controversy of his son's…

695
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:29,571
I never imagined an assemblyman would

696
00:52:29,654 --> 00:52:33,950
come by and visit the funeral
for ordinary people like us.

697
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:37,370
His wife was the first to arrive,

698
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:41,082
but she refused to register
in the visitor's book.

699
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,126
I didn't even know who she was.

700
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,586
YBS reported--

701
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:48,590
Public sentiment is rapidly shifting.

702
00:52:49,841 --> 00:52:50,884
Looks like it.

703
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,139
Assemblyman Nam is
more talented than I expected.

704
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:30,674
How did you know about that funeral?

705
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,764
NAMGOONG SOL, 22, THREATENED
BY HER MED SCHOOL BOYFRIEND…

706
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:41,268
I found out about Ms. Namgoong's case
as I headed to work that day.

707
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,769
ARREST WARRANT DECLINED,
BLACKMAIL LED TO SUICIDE

708
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,942
I was leaving the funeral
of Mr. Bae's mother-in-law.

709
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,610
Thank you, Assemblyman Nam.

710
00:53:52,737 --> 00:53:53,738
I saw her name

711
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:57,367
-at the hall next door.
-Just a moment.

712
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:12,590
I see.

713
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,510
How did you know about it?

714
00:54:16,511 --> 00:54:18,263
I didn't know you visited her.

715
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:20,849
I found out by coincidence.

716
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:24,769
I visited her earlier that day
because I was worried.

717
00:54:27,188 --> 00:54:31,234
On my way home,
I thought it would be great

718
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:32,819
if you had visited her there,

719
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,487
but I didn't bother to tell you.

720
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:38,199
Thank you for visiting her.

721
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:45,206
It was a coincidence
that my visit was reported.

722
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,751
Even you didn't know I was there.

723
00:54:49,377 --> 00:54:51,880
It was a series of
two amazing coincidences.

724
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:54,174
But I exploited that.

725
00:54:57,177 --> 00:54:58,595
It keeps weighing on me.

726
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:03,808
-I…
-I know.

727
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,520
I know how you feel right now.

728
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:11,483
But you did the right thing.

729
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,528
I don't know anything about politics

730
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,489
or how things work in your world.

731
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:21,785
But as you said, that's one of the things
an assemblyman can do, right?

732
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:27,540
Honey.

733
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:32,629
I have never once doubted
your sincerity to this day.

734
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,257
Before I knew you as an assemblyman,

735
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:42,472
I knew you as my husband that I trusted,

736
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,518
loved, and married.

737
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:53,691
Thank you.

738
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:05,703
I love you.

739
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:23,221
I researched more information

740
00:56:23,304 --> 00:56:26,182
on the transportation infrastructure
of district one.

741
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:27,809
Let's see.

742
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:29,936
Oh, right.

743
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,939
The reapplication of the warrant
against the med school student is today.

744
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,816
Yes.

745
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:37,444
They expedited the process
after your news appearance

746
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,695
shifted public sentiment.

747
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:41,865
Good.

748
00:56:43,908 --> 00:56:45,952
When informed of a breakup,

749
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:48,329
Ji, a medical student
at a prestigious university,

750
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:50,790
threatened to distribute
a private video of his ex-girlfriend

751
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,834
and ultimately led her
to take her own life.

752
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,295
Sinyang Police Station of Seoul decided

753
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,589
-to reapply for an arrest warrant…
-God, Buddha.

754
00:56:57,672 --> 00:57:00,216
-…for the suspect, Ji.
-Thank you.

755
00:57:00,842 --> 00:57:03,511
-Thank you.
-As the story spread online,

756
00:57:03,595 --> 00:57:05,388
it outraged citizens
who began to criticize

757
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:07,724
-the prosecution's response…
-Thank you.

758
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:10,769
Is this Mr. Ji Seung-kyu's home?

759
00:57:14,022 --> 00:57:15,148
We're with the police.

760
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,816
We came to execute his arrest warrant

761
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,277
for blackmailing
and filming without consent.

762
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,237
-Is Mr. Ji Seung-kyu inside?
-Wait.

763
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:23,490
Honey.

764
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:27,744
Why are you suddenly doing this?

765
00:57:27,827 --> 00:57:29,704
You said he wouldn't be detained!

766
00:57:29,788 --> 00:57:32,373
This was officially issued by the court.

767
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,753
Honey!

768
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:42,175
-No!
-Help!

769
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,969
-No!
-Do something!

770
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:48,848
Please come this way.

771
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,892
-It's all right.
-No.

772
00:57:51,684 --> 00:57:53,186
-Oh, no.
-No.

773
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,146
It's all right.

774
00:58:05,532 --> 00:58:07,033

JI SEUNG-KYU THE SEX CRIMINAL? EXPOSED.

777

KILL YOURSELF JI SEUNG-KYU.
DIE!

778

DIE, CRIMINAL SCUM.
MED SCHOOL STUDENT? NO WAY.

779
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,460
-There are things…
-Mr. Ji Seung-kyu!

780
00:58:17,544 --> 00:58:19,128
-…that nobody…
-Mr. Ji Seung-kyu!

781
00:58:19,212 --> 00:58:21,589
even dreams of ever happening.

782
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,012
Although nobody meant for it to happen…

at times, it happens without fail.

785
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:41,985
We call this…

786

an accident.

TROLLEY

789
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:21,900
He called him out publicly
and he committed suicide?

790
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,193
I'm truly concerned about Assemblyman Nam.

791
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:25,945
You should humor her for the time being.

792
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,031
You have to focus on the general election.

793
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:30,575
Who will you tell them I am?

794
00:59:30,658 --> 00:59:32,619
