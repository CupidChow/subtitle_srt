She's a kid I know.

44

Yes, she's just a kid I know.

Look, Seung-hee.

46

Sure.

00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,979
Save my number.

I'll call you.

Okay.

Ms. Kim.

Ms. Kim.

61
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,359
Let's visit Ji-hoon some other time.

62
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,529
I'm feeling unwell.
I need to get some rest.

63
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,331
<i><font color="white">What?</font></i>

64
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,249
My name?

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes.

66
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,169
I'm taking out a mortgage
to fund the election campaign.

67
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,213
I needed our resident registration forms

68
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,215
since the house
is under both of our names,

69
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,300
and yours said you had changed your name.

70
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:43,760
Kim Jae-eun?

71
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,596
It's a pretty name. Why did you change it?

72
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,267
No reason.

73
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,686
"Kim Jae-eun."

74
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,188
That's new.

75
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,148
Go to bed first.

76
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,942
I'll be in the study.

77
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,712
Thank you for reaching out to us.

78
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,010
I came here to tell you
to stop what you're doing.

79
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,513
My mother-in-law has done nothing wrong.

80
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,600
We can get into that later.

81
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,311
Are you originally from Youngsan?

82
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,730
It's also my wife's hometown.

83
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,107
I see.

84
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,779
She often talks about
fond memories of Youngsan,

85
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,867
so whenever I meet people from there,
I feel at home as well.

86
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,495
But I try to stay professional

87
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,039
and distinguish

88
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,166
right from wrong.

89
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,266
Now that we're acquainted,
try to arrange a meal with him.

90
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,811
What are you doing?

91
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,774
Sir, it's about Ji Seung-kyu's family.

92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,692
Ji Seung…

93
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,611
Right, the medical student? What is it?

94
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,949
His mother swallowed some pills.

95
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,002
Do you think Mr. Nam's meeting
with Mr. Choi didn't go very well?

96
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,213
He's been looking kind of uneasy.

97
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,839
Right?

98
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,175
What could it be?

99
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,220
ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE

100
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,638
Thanks. Bye.

101
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,270
They pumped her stomach,
so her life is not in danger.

102
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,150
Why did she do it?

103
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,404
I'm not sure.

104
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,321
Well…

105
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,992
She must be either heartbroken
over the loss of her son

106
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,702
or shocked by the hateful comments.

107
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,790
Every article about him had quite a few
comments saying that he deserved to die.

108
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,963
I called them "hateful comments",

109
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,340
but that's the public sentiment.

110
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,093
So please don't blame yourself

111
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,971
for what happened to him or his mother.

112
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,689
Are you thinking about Ji-hoon?

113
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,027
How could I not?

114
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,864
He must have received
tens of thousands of hate comments.

115
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,324
Every time he did something wrong

116
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,744
and even after his death.

117
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,998
It's true that what he did was wrong,

118
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,668
and he should be scolded
and punished for it.

119
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,006
But…

120

I ask for him to be punished
strictly by the law,

124

and I sincerely apologize as his father

125

"Don't give a criminal a narrative."

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,444
That's what the audience says these days

135
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,240
when characters in movies or dramas
say something like that.

136
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,327
They refuse to give criminals
any room for pity

137
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,079
or being understood.

138

That's the public sentiment.

I have a heavy heart

but that's the reality.

141
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,384
What I mean by that is,

142
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,428
you have to keep your pity,
or any form of personal sentiments

143
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,056
toward Ji-hoon or
Ji Seung-kyu's mother, at home.

144
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,517
You should only express it to your wife.

145
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,979
You're not Ji-hoon's father right now.

146

You're an assemblyman
with an election coming up.

147

you have to stay professional.

what would you rather have
the cause of death be?

Suicide, murder…

151

or an accident?

152
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,442
The last one would be the least painful.

a happy life, haven't you?

00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,654
NEW MESSAGE FROM SEUNG-HEE

165
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,326
MEDICAL STUDENT COMMITS SUICIDE
AFTER BEING EXPOSED BY NAM

166
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,497
<i><font color="white">Your husband killed someone as well.</font></i>

167

169
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,310
INCOMING CALL

170
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,608
-Hey, Seung-hee.
<i><font color="white">-I saw the news.</font></i>

171
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,236
Hey.

172
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,362
Look, Seung-hee…

173
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,114
<i><font color="white">Did you think fleeing to Seoul
and changing your name</font></i>

174
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,076
would cover up the murder you committed?

175
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,997
<i><font color="white">If that's what you wanted,
you should have kept a low profile.</font></i>

176
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,791
<i><font color="white">Did you think no one would recognize you</font></i>

177
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,627
when you're the wife of an assemblyman?

178
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,006
<i><font color="white">Come to Youngsan.</font></i>

179
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,674
<i><font color="white">We should…</font></i>

180
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,052
<i><font color="white">continue our little chat.</font></i>

181
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,139
Come here tomorrow.

182
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,767
And don't even think about running away.

183
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,021
Seung-hee--

184
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,449
YOUR HUSBAND KILLED SOMEONE AS WELL.
DOES HE KNOW ABOUT YOUR PAST?

185
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,798
Mom.

186
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,552
Mom.

187
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,178
Hey, I'm home.

188
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,349
Where have you been all day?

189
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,518
Sorry.

190
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,686
I had to take care of something.

191
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,772
Mom.

192
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,025
What is it?

193
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,444
Well…

194
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,238
I know we're supposed to go
shopping for land tomorrow,

195
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,323
but can you go without me?

196
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:50,992
Why?

197
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,077
Something's come up.

198
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,622
You're meeting your friends
in the evening anyway.

199
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,958
I'll go with you next time, okay?

200
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,710
Just for tomorrow.

201
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,421
I wouldn't be of much help anyway.

202
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,010
Hey, is Ki-young home yet?

203
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,182
"Ki-young"?

204
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,644
You come home
after spending the entire day out,

205
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,731
and the first person
you ask about is your husband?

206
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,694
Are you not worried about me
who's been at home all alone?

207
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,325
You two should have just gone
to live in Australia without me.

208
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,038
Mom.

209
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,790
Could you please stop saying that?

210
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:43,252
I'm really sorry for saying
I wanted to move to Australia.

211
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,505
But I didn't go. So please--

212
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,756
I don't want to hear it.

213
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,177
You're the only child I have left
after Seung-ho passed away,

214
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,014
but I don't want to talk
to a heartless person like you anymore.

215
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,017
I'll go by myself tomorrow.

216
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,686
And I'll drop dead right there

217
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,355
-and go meet Seung-ho.
-Mom.

218
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,901
Fine.

219
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,361
I'll come with you, okay?

220
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,238
I'm sorry about everything
and I'll come with you.

221
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,949
So please just stop it, will you?

222
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,962
COME TO THIS ADDRESS

223
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,011
<i><font color="white">Come to this address at 7 p.m. tomorrow.</font></i>

224
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,682
<i><font color="white">You murderer.</font></i>

225
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,902
DELETE

226
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,696
YOU MURDERER

227
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,989
DELETE FROM THIS DEVICE

228
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,554
I'll revise the parts you mentioned today

229
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,847
and report back to you.

230
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,973
Yes, that would be great.

231
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,767
But if I'm being honest,

232
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,353
It seems a bit premature
to discuss the next term's agenda

233
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,023
as we prepare for the upcoming election.

234
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,357
Not at all, sir.

235
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,568
You should definitely look far ahead.

236
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,071
I decided to work with you this term

237
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,158
because I saw you
advocating for the underprivileged

238
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,827
during your previous term.

239
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,581
I didn't join to be here
for just a single term.

240
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,585
You need to stay in politics

241
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,004
and improve our country.

242
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,088
Absolutely.

243
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,673
And don't worry about the election.

244
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,258
We'll do all the legwork.

245
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,010
I've been jogging 30 minutes a day.

246
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,471
Take it easy.

247
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,849
Thank you for your encouragement.

248
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,225
I'll do my best.

249
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,477
-You got this, sir!
-You got this.

250
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,118
Why are you out here?

251
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,578
Ki-young.

252
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,084
Were you waiting for me?

253
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,213
You weren't coming home,
so I thought you left me.

254
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,967
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?

255
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,636
It's been a while.

256
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,888
Maybe another time.

257
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,057
My mom is home alone.

258
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,644
Ki-young.

259
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,648
Things will…

260
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,234
get better soon.

261
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,372
Hey, come and eat.

262
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,041
Hye-joo isn't eating. She has a headache.

263
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,835
Maybe she has a cold.

264
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,170
Are you feeling better?

265
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,632
-Yes.
-Go ahead and eat.

266
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,510
I'll eat after bringing her some porridge.

267
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,137
I'll bring it to her.

268
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,400
What are you…

269
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,528
Give me that.
Why are you touching my phone?

270
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,865
MISSED CALL FROM HUSBAND

271
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,705
Don't come into my room or touch my stuff
without my permission. Understand?

272
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,250
Okay.

273
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,710
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,627
Hi, honey.

275
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,921
I missed your call.

276
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,215
Sorry. What's up?

277
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,968
What?

278
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,511
My voice?

279
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,473
No, I'm not sick.

280
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,016
I think it's just a cold.

281
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,521
Were you just calling to check in?

282
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,481
Okay.

283
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,817
All right. See you later.

284
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,734
Bye.

285
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,672
So please don't think about visiting
Ji Seung-kyu's mother at the hospital.

286
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,383
<i><font color="white">You'll only receive public backlash.</font></i>

287
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,613
-Mom.
-Hey, Yoon-seo.

288
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,073
Are you sick?

289
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,703
Did you catch a cold?
Or is it something else?

290
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,246
No, I'm fine.

291
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,914
Did you eat?

292
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,499
Yes. Are you hungry?

293
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,209
I already ate.

294
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,502
Should I get you some medicine?

295
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,879
That's okay.

296
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,965
-Mom, don't be sick.
-Yes?

297
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,927
-Okay?
-I'm not sick. I'm totally fine.

298
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,638
Are you sure?

299
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,206
How dare you?

300
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,709
How dare you come here?

301
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,678
You killed my son!

302
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,638
Are you here to see
if his mother died as well?

303
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,599
You have no right to come here,
you murderer!

304
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,273
Say something, damn it.

305
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,694
Why did you do that to Seung-kyu?

306
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,905
Being an assemblyman
doesn't give you that right!

307
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,991
Where's that badge of yours?

308
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,159
What is it?

309
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,370
Are you going to resign
for what you've done?

310
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,287
Are you?

311
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,333
I also

312
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,461
lost my son recently.

313
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,382
I'm not here today

314
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,468
as an assemblyman.

315
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,304
I'm here…

316
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,266
as a father…

317
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,269
who lost his son.

318
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,483
Drop the act!

319
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,071
No matter what you say,
it won't bring my son back.

320
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,656
Answer me!

321
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,076
Did he really deserve to die?

322
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,995
Answer me!

323
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,461
You killed my son!

324
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,881
Let me go!

325
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,469
Let me go!

327
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,303
She gave it to me here,

328
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,431
and I put it in my bag.

329
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,100
Where the heck is it?

ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

336
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,346
Honey.

337
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,767
I'm sorry. Did I startle you?

338
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,854
Just leave it, honey. I'll clean it up.

339
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,564
-Just leave it.
-It's okay.

340
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,233
Sorry, I'll make some again.

341
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,693
That's okay.

342
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,278
I'm going to head out.

343
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,952
Right, Yoon-seo's class is
visiting the National Assembly today.

344
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,997
Right. That was today.

345
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,417
Hold on.

346
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,339
You're not running a fever.

347
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,092
You sounded sick yesterday,
and you look really pale right now.

348
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,636
No, I'm okay.

349
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,848
Don't just say that.
Go see a doctor later.

350
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,059
Okay.

351
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,685
All right. See you later.

352
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,925
SEUNG-HEE: COME TO THIS ADDRESS AT 7 P.M.

353
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,792
Come in.

354
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,214
For breakfast and lunch…

355
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,592
Right.

356
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,848
I thought you forgot these.

357
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,599
Did you bring these from my studio?

358
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,725
Sorry?

359
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:16,643
Yes.

360
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,355
I stopped by last night
to look for my lip balm.

361
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,274
-Lip balm?
-Yes, my lip balm.

362
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,027
I saw the passcode
when you were opening the--

363
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,571
What did I tell you?

364
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,907
I told you not to go into my space
without my permission, didn't I?

365
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,707
I'm sorry.

366
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,210
I'm just a kid you know.
I shouldn't have gone into your space.

367
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,214
But I only did so

368
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,760
because you didn't keep
your promise about finding my lip balm.

369
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,225
Aren't you taking these?

370
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,230
Should I put them back?

371
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,607
Or should I throw them away?

372
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,160
There's a statue too.

373
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,411
You're right.

374
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,788
It's huge.

375
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,041
Hello,

376
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,376
I'm Assemblyman Nam Joong-do of Sinyang.

377
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,546
-You're awesome!
-You're so handsome!

378
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,548
-You're so amazing!
-It's nice to meet you!

379
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,966
How do you like being here?

380
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,927
-We love it!
-It's so nice!

381
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,720
-You're so cool!
-You're amazing.

382
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,763
Thank you.

383
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,415
Hye-joo told you to bring this to me?
Why isn't she using it at home?

384
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,833
I'm not sure.

385
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,751
All right.

386
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,046
It's all done.

387
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,685
Have some <i><font color="white">kalguksu</font></i> as well
next time, okay?

388
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,563
Thank you. Goodbye.

389
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,897
Bye.

390
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,441
Pay up.

391
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,568
You need to pay for that.

392
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,446
Ms. Hyeon, she didn't pay.

393
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,866
Hey, why are you leaving without--

394
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,828
Come back for some <i><font color="white">kalguksu</font></i>, okay?
Be careful not to spill that.

395
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,580
-But--
-Go on.

396
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,585
FREE FOOD FOR CHILDREN, TEENAGERS,
AND PREGNANT WOMEN

397
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,798
Have you had lunch?

398
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,595
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

399
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,139
It's nice to meet you.

400
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,098
Gosh.

401
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,559
-This is so cool.
-Nice to meet you.

402
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,561
-Your dad is so amazing.
-I'm going to frame this.

403
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:48,438
See you at home.

404
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,608
So you're Da-som.

405
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,609
Hi.

406
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,653
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

407
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,115
By the way,
is this really your personal number?

408
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,242
Yes. Call that number, and I'll pick up.

409
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,452
No way.

410
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,371
Do you give dating advice?

411
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,832
I'm sorry, but I only do that
on the weekends.

412
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,126
Did you not have breakfast?

413
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,170
Then you get an extra.

414
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,380
Thank you.

415
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,804
You didn't know how things work here,

416
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,889
so I don't blame you,

417
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,935
but it still bothers me

418
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,687
that I couldn't explain it properly.

419
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,316
Lots of kids are coming by today.

420
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,068
-Really?
-Yes.

421
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:39,781
I still wish more kids would stop by.

422
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,910
Didn't you say Yoon-seo's grandmother
gave you dumplings for free?

423
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,828
Yes.

424
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,207
Whenever my mom was working late,

425
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,502
I'd come here by myself
and ask for some dumplings.

426
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:58,591
And when my mom would
hurry over to apologize and try to pay,

427
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,511
she wouldn't take the money
and she'd say children had to eat well.

428
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,682
And she would say
that's what neighbors are for.

429
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,562
When I came back to this neighborhood

430
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,897
and didn't know how to make ends meet,

431
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,443
she gave me a job here.

432
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,445
I was truly grateful.

433
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,406
Had she been around a bit longer,

434
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,825
she would have seen her son
become an assemblyman.

435
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,327
Come to think of it,

436
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,830
Assemblyman Nam must
take after his mother.

437
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,169
Yeo-jin, can I take
a couple bottles of that oil home?

438
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,670
Sure.

439

OPTIMIZATION OF SEX CRIME VICTIM SUPPORT

440
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,803
PENALTY AND VICTIM SUPPORT
FOR DIGITAL SEX CRIME

441
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,222
Sir,

442
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,808
I'm sure you know, as a member of
the Legislation and Judiciary Committee,

443
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,645
but there hasn't been a single
proposed amendment regarding sex crimes

444
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,857
that passed the committee's review
to be referred to the plenary session

445
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,567
this year.

446
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,362
With dozens of bills proposed every day
in the National Assembly,

447
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,241
it makes sense that not every one
of them is discussed in depth.

448
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,787
My term will be over in a few months.

449
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,081
All bills that fail to be passed by then

450
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,584
will automatically be disposed of.

451
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,044
Right.

452
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,756
If I'm being completely honest,

453
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,593
unless a major case of sex crime occurs

454
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,386
that brings about

455
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,431
a great public uproar,

456
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,685
it won't be easy to push ahead with a bill

457
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,396
in merely six months.

458
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,524
I agree with her.

459
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,108
During Ji Seung-kyu's case,

460
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,612
the public demanded
severe punishment for sex offenders…

461
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,030
But it didn't last long.

462
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:48,159
We live in Dynamic Korea
where we have a new headline every day.

463
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,413
Sir, it's time for you
to visit the district office.

464
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,207
Okay.

465
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,646
Why are you still here?

466
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,523
I haven't paid.

467
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:19,983
Forget it.

468
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,651
No, I want to pay.

469
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,778
We don't charge pregnant women either.

470
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,530
You didn't read it thoroughly, did you?

471
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,906
FREE FOOD FOR CHILDREN, TEENAGERS,
AND PREGNANT WOMEN

472
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,284
Did you think
I didn't charge you last time

473
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,036
because you were pregnant
with Ji-hoon's child?

474
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,665
Although that's also true.

475
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,583
Either way,

476
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,003
I'm glad you can eat our dumplings
despite your morning sickness.

477
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,672
Come by whenever you want.

478
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,426
Okay.

479
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,296
YEO-JIN

480
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,018
-Hey, Yeo-jin.
-Hey, Hye-joo. It's me.

481
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,311
I received the oil.

but they told me
you couldn't accept any gifts.

he had only threatened to leak it.

Then the case was closed
following his death.

So no one knew about the leak

not to show up like this.

637
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,414
Do you not like me?

638
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,417
Why not?

639
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,212
Seung-ho, you see…

640
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:17,468
I've never thought of you
to be more than Seung-hee's brother.

641
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,936
So I'm asking you. Please.

642
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:33,901
Don't come here again.

643
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,371
Bye.

Hey, kid.

00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,210
Is something wrong? Do you need help?

650
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,965
Hey, is that blood on your clothes?

651
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,432
Hey!

652
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,816
I'd like an apology.

653
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,987
And please stay away from me.

654
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:06,743
Pardon?

655
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,871
Boys can be like that

656
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,833
when they like someone.

657
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,919
And I'll be blunt.

658
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,130
Nothing really happened.

659
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,632
You just scraped your palms and knees.

660
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:21,550
That's…

661
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,553
That's because I ran away.

662
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,054
If I hadn't, I would have…

663
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,183
Here.

664
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,977
Take this, okay?

665
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,607
I understand that you're hurt
and upset right now,

666
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,902
But can you just pretend
that you briefly went out

667
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,738
with a law student
from Seoul National University?

668
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,947
Let me go.

669
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,243
I'll…

670
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,206
I'll get you a scholarship
to Gyeongji University.

671
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,168
My husband's aunt is the chairwoman there.

672
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,008
How will you pay your tuition

673
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,052
when you don't have parents?

674
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,722
I'll make sure you get that scholarship.

675
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:13,393
So let's not make a big deal
out of nothing, okay?

676
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,447
I'll…

677
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,325
take the scholarship then.

678
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,577
Okay.

679
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,539
I'll make sure you get it.

680
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,832
The scholarship.

681
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:48,845
Kim Jae-eun.

682
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:57,771
Don't be mistaken.

683
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,608
It's not like I actually liked you.

684
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,237
If you needed money,
you should have just said so.

685
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,990
You pathetic orphan.
