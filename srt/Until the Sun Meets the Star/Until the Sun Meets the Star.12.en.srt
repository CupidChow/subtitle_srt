1
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Lungo coffee, your favorite.

2
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,720
Maybe the boldness

3
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,040
will make you reconsider and come back
to the coffee you used to love.

4
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
If the coffee is good, you don't need
to flirt. He'll drink it anyway.

5
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,160
Are you sure you'll finish in time?

6
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes, I'm sure.

7
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
<i>We've reached a consensus.</i>

8
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
<i>We've decided on…</i>

9
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,280
<i>Tom Yum Goong.</i>

10
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,120
Does that mean

11
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,600
we passed the second challenge?

12
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
How is it?

13
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,440
Very smooth.

14
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,520
I'd like to introduce our Tom Yum bisque.

15
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,240
You did an excellent job.

16
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,760
Thank you, Kim.
If you hadn't given me those tips,

17
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,600
I wouldn't have made it.

18
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,600
Selling a dish is one thing,

19
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,120
but if the food isn't good,
it wouldn't have passed.

20
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,880
- Here you go, my dear niece.
- Thank you, Uncle Pu.

21
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,840
Wait a sec, Uncle Pu.

22
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,040
What now?

23
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,280
I have an announcement to make.

24
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,840
Uncle Pu here

25
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
is actually the inspiration

26
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,960
behind our three-colored bread!

27
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,360
Wow.

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,640
Me? What bread are you talking about?

29
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,160
The soup's done,

30
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,120
the sour cream from France has arrived,

31
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,880
and I need to pick up
some kaffir limes tomorrow.

32
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,320
Other seasoning…

33
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
What else am I missing?

34
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,640
What are you looking at?
Don't even think about it.

35
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,040
I waited in line for two hours for this.
I'm not sharing.

36
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,320
Thanks to Uncle Pu's
condensed milk-dipped bread that day,

37
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,000
we came up with the idea
for the three-colored bread.

38
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,040
So, it was all because of me.

39
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,440
Wow.

40
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
Thank you so much, Uncle Pu.

41
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,920
No worries, Mr. Pathawee.

42
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,000
If you ever need anything,
just let me know.

43
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
I will.

44
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,480
Awesome.

45
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,040
Come on.

46
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Do you want this?

47
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,120
Go ahead.

48
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
Are you hungry?

49
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,760
Alright, let's celebrate, everyone!

50
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,080
We've made it just in time
for the fun, right?

51
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,560
Whoa, Mr. Kimhan, sir. You must be tired.

52
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,760
The drinks? Let me take that.

53
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,880
Hurry up and chill these.

54
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,840
- Go.
- Thank you, Uncle Pu.

55
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,320
Please, have a seat.

56
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,800
Right here.

57
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,400
Scoot over a bit. Please have a seat.

58
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,960
Sit next to each other.

59
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,760
Perfect pair.

60
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Alright.

61
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,080
Ugh, I'm bored of BBQ.

62
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,480
What I really want is someone beside me.

63
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,040
BBQ doesn't make you fat.

64
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,320
It makes you well-rounded
and irresistible!

65
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
But if you ever feel lonely,
remember you always have us

66
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
to eat BBQ with!

67
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,120
Even pork has a grill,
but I still have no one.

68
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,040
If BBQ is fun, then I must be even better!

69
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Yay!

70
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,960
Yay!

71
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Cheers!

72
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,800
Cheers!

73
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,400
Cheers!

74
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
Hey.

75
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,280
You're full now, right?

76
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,880
Let's play a game.

77
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,120
What kind of game?

78
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,560
What kind of game is this, Uncle Pu?

79
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,320
It's the newspaper folding game.

80
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
The last pair standing

81
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,600
gets to pick who does the dishes.

82
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
I see.

83
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,040
This is just a lazy person's game.

84
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,240
You gotta outsmart people sometimes.

85
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,160
Now, hurry up and pair up!

86
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
Go ahead.

87
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,200
- You're with me.
- Okay.

88
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,000
Then, Namfah, you're with me.

89
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,640
Sure, Mr. Wee.

90
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,880
There are no sisters in this game,

91
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
Nubdao.

92
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,200
Of course.

93
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,720
This time, I'm not doing the dishes.

94
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,720
Wow, you guys
really hate doing dishes, huh?

95
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,640
Alright, alright.

96
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,920
Everyone ready?

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,560
- Yes.
- Let's start.

98
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,000
Hurry up.

99
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,280
You lose!

100
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
Out!

101
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,840
Final round. Ready, fold it up.

102
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,800
Ten.

103
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,120
- I'll do it.
- Nine.

104
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,600
- Eight.
- Ready!

105
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,480
Seven.

106
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,320
Namfah, hop on my back.

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
Are you sure?

108
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes.

109
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,760
Nubdao, stand on my feet.

110
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,800
- Is that even possible?
- Of course.

111
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,400
- Hurry, Namfah.
- Sorry, Mr. Wee.

112
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm so proud of you, dear.

113
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
You did amazingly well.

114
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,880
Thank you, Mother.

115
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,280
If it weren't for Kim's presentation tips,

116
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
I don't think I would've made it.

117
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
Kimhan?

118
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,480
Yes.

119
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,880
I think Nubdao must have convinced him.

120
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,720
Right now, Nubdao and I
are just good friends, Mother.

121
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,920
And… are you okay with that?

122
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
Yes.

123
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,320
I think it's a good start

124
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,880
for me and Kim, too.

125
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,120
<i>Namfah, hop on my back.</i>

126
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,920
Are you sure?

127
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,600
Yes.

128
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,120
- Hurry, Namfah.
- Sorry, Mr. Wee.

129
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,960
Namfah.

130
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
Namfah!

131
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,560
Is Mr. Kim almost here?

132
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,640
I told him not to come.
He got home late last night.

133
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,480
Then I'll go with you.

134
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,520
Isn't Mr. Pathawee picking you up?

135
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,280
I already told him not to.

136
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,920
Let's just go before we're late.

137
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,720
Come in.

138
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,080
I have some documents that require
both your and Mr. Pathawee's signatures.

139
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,440
Got something to say?

140
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,400
At 4 p.m., there's a board meeting.

141
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,360
Don't forget.

142
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Are you asleep yet?

143
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,040
<i>Almost. Did you just finish your meeting?</i>

144
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,640
That ended a while ago.

145
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
I was just catching up on work.

146
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
<i>Are you tired?</i>

147
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,560
A little, but hearing
your voice makes it better.

148
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,240
Nubdao, I'll call you back.

149
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,720
<i>Okay.</i>

150
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,320
Excuse me. Are you alright?

151
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,000
Yada?

152
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,200
Yada.

153
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,080
What happened to you?

154
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
Did someone hurt you?

155
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,080
Let's go to the hospital.

156
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,680
Then, let me take you home.

157
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,320
I don't want to go home yet.

158
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,040
Stop here, please.

159
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,760
That's my mother…

160
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,520
and her new husband.

161
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't go.

162
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,680
Are you just going to let him
hurt your mother like that?

163
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,880
If you interfere,

164
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,200
it'll only make things worse.

165
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
Hey!

166
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,720
Are you going to divorce or not?!

167
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
No?!

168
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,480
You're not?!

169
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,040
I told you I don't love you.
I've never loved you.

170
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,840
No woman

171
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,320
should ever have to endure this.

172
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,680
I've tried to stop him before.

173
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,520
But this is…

174
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,360
how it always ends.

175
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,480
And he threatened me.

176
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,960
He said if I told anyone,

177
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,520
he'd kill my mother.

178
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,760
Is this…

179
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,000
why you don't want to go home?

180
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,360
What are you going to do next?

181
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,480
Nub! If you keep spacing out like that,
your clothes are gonna burn.

182
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
What's wrong with you?

183
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Are you waiting for Mr. Kim to call?

184
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,200
He said he'd call back.

185
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Then, why don't you just call him first?

186
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,320
Hey!

187
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,640
If your sister calls first,
she'll look like a desperate little chick.

188
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
Chick? What chick?

189
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,520
A little chick. Cluck, cluck, cluck!
Always pecking, always nagging!

190
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,600
Uncle Pu!

191
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
She's not a nagging chick.

192
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,240
She's just worried about him.

193
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,280
If you keep hovering over him like that,

194
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,640
he might think you don't trust him.

195
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,560
You sound like
you've been paid to defend him.

196
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,800
You really think I care more about money
than about you two?

197
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

198
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,240
Alright, I'm going.

199
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,040
I'm just going to wait
until my stepfather goes back inside.

200
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,200
You should go home, Kim.

201
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,600
Let me stay here with you.

202
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
Thank you.

203
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,720
Is this why…

204
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,880
when we…

205
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,480
back in school,

206
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,960
you never let me
drop you off at your house?

207
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,000
My family

208
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,240
isn't the kind of family
I'd love to show to anyone.

209
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,280
When he's sober, he's a good man.

210
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,960
He gives my mom everything she asks for.

211
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,920
But when he drinks,

212
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,360
he turns into a monster.

213
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,120
Have you ever reported him?

214
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes.

215
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,760
But in the end, love conquers all.

216
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,800
Mom always made me drop the charges.

217
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,960
I understand.

218
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,760
If I could,

219
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,880
I'd take my mom far away from this hell.

220
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,360
But that day will never come.

221
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,360
Kim, can I ask you something?

222
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,920
Please don't tell anyone about this.

223
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
It's embarrassing.

224
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,880
Of course.

225
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
That includes Nubdao, too.

226
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm begging you.

227
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,840
I'M GOING TO SLEEP NOW

228
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,240
GOOD NIGHT

229
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,440
SEE YOU TOMORROW

230
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,400
Yes, Mr. Kimhan? Are you almost here?

231
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,040
- Nubdao.
- Yes?

232
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm sorry
for not calling you back last night.

233
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,920
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

234
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,400
I need to apologize again.

235
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,720
I won't make it in time to pick you up.

236
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,680
It's fine.

237
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,840
Was there a problem with work yesterday?

238
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,960
No, nothing.

239
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,320
I have to go. See you at work.

240
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,520
Okay. See you.

241
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Here, let me help.

242
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,120
When did I fall asleep?

243
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,200
Are you okay?

244
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,040
I'm fine.

245
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,640
Thank you for staying with me all night.

246
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,400
Want me to drive you to your house?

247
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,760
It's fine. See you at work.

248
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,640
Mr. Wee!

249
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,680
Well…

250
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,800
I finished cleaning here,
but I need to help at the main kitchen.

251
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,880
Thank you.

252
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,680
Wait, Namfah. I'm heading there too.

253
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,720
Why does my heart always beat so fast

254
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,400
when I'm near him?

255
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,720
Good morning, Mr. Pathawee.

256
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,720
Good morning.

257
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,600
If I stay near him again,

258
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,600
will my heart race like that too?

259
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
Are you okay, Namfah?

260
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,240
No.

261
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,920
What's with her today? She's acting weird.

262
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,320
I'm in time for my favorite coffee, am I?

263
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
You seem really tired today.

264
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,960
Did you not sleep well?

265
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
I barely slept.

266
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,000
I didn't sleep until morning.

267
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,040
Was it work stress or something else?

268
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,160
Both, actually.

269
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,360
But seeing you now,

270
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,400
I feel better.

271
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,520
Nubdao,

272
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,160
I'm really sorry

273
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
for not calling you back yesterday.

274
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,640
And for not picking you up.

275
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,360
It's totally fine.

276
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,680
Thank you.

277
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,440
You don't look well, Ms. Yada.

278
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,920
Are you sick?

279
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,720
Yes.

280
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,160
Maybe you should rest in the infirmary?

281
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,560
It's alright.

282
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,840
I'll just go see a doctor later.

283
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,880
Let me wash your cup for you, then.

284
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,080
- Thanks.
- No problem.

285
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,400
Kim must really like your coffee.

286
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,080
He finished the whole cup.

287
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,160
He couldn't sleep well last night.

288
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,760
Kim usually sleeps like a log.

289
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,840
He said he was stressed
about a lot of things.

290
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,280
What kind of things?

291
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,320
I don't know either.

292
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,800
Kim has changed a lot.

293
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,040
He used to tell me everything.

294
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,520
Really?

295
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,480
I don't get it.

296
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,920
Why does Kim have to make up
with that damn Wee?

297
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,760
He helps him pass the presentation?

298
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,480
So annoying!

299
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,600
At first, I was happy

300
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,520
you agreed to have lunch with me.

301
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
Turns out,

302
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,560
you just wanted
to rant about your brother.

303
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,800
Wee is not my brother.

304
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,480
And I'm not here

305
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
because I want to have lunch with you.

306
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,480
Then you came because you missed me?

307
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,840
No. I just…

308
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,880
came to pay you back
for the shirt and the car wash.

309
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,440
You could've just transferred the money.

310
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,880
Give me your QR code.

311
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Nope.

312
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,400
Come on. I don't like owing people.

313
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,560
But I want you to owe me.

314
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,640
That way, I get to see you more.

315
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,560
Fine. Then stop being friends with Wee.

316
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,200
You really hate him that much?

317
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,400
If you mention him again, I'll block you.

318
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,160
No calls, no messages, no meetups.

319
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,840
What about this?

320
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,520
Whenever you fight with Wee

321
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,080
or get mad at him,

322
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,240
you come rant to me. Anytime, anywhere.

323
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,920
Alright? I'll always be on your side.

324
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,480
That's ridiculous.

325
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,080
You're his friend.
Why would you take my side?

326
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,720
Because I'm flirting with you.

327
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,640
What?

328
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,240
I like you. Of course, I'd take your side.

329
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,360
If I liked Wee,

330
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,760
I'd take his. Alright?

331
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,800
Can I stay for dinner?

332
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
Of course.

333
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,800
But after eating, you need
to go home and get some rest.

334
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,480
Then… maybe I should just sleep here.

335
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,600
Sure.

336
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,240
Uncle Pu's room has some space.

337
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,120
That looks delicious.

338
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,880
Almost done.

339
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
Hello?

340
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,480
<i>Kim, I'm scared.</i>

341
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,240
Nubdao, I have an urgent matter.
I need to go.

342
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,600
Yada!

343
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,720
Nubdao, I'm back!

344
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,520
I'm starving. What's for dinner?

345
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,480
Wow, looks delicious!
Is this Kim's kid's basil pork?

346
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,080
Where is he?

347
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,480
Mr. Kim?

348
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,240
- Mr.--
- No need to call him. He left already.

349
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
What? Why?

350
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,320
Something urgent came up.

351
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,640
Oh…

352
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,480
Why did you come back alone?

353
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,520
Didn't Mr. Wee take you home?

354
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,840
That means?

355
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,080
I mean he didn't take me home.

356
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,680
The basil pork looks amazing.
Can I eat now?

357
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,720
Stop.

358
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,400
Wash your hands first.

359
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,240
Alright.

360
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,520
MR. WEE, DON'T WAIT FOR ME
I STILL HAVE WORK TO DO

361
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,880
NO PROBLEM. I CAN WAIT

362
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,040
REALLY, DON'T WAIT
I'LL GO HOME BY MYSELF

363
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,000
I'LL COME TO THE KITCHEN

364
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,160
NO NEED

365
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,360
WHY?

366
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,240
I NEED TO GO TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY TODAY

367
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,880
WHOSE BIRTHDAY?

368
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,800
AN OLD CLASSMATE
SO, HAVE A SAFE TRIP BACK HOME

369
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Wee.

370
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,600
Today,

371
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,640
I'm not ready to be alone with you yet.

372
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,880
I'm scared you'll hear
my heart beating too fast.

373
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,640
Yes, Mr. Kim?

374
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,000
Did you eat yet?

375
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,200
Yes, I already ate. What about you?

376
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,600
<i>I haven't had time yet.</i>

377
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,600
My friend is in serious condition,

378
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,360
and she's alone.

379
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,680
I had to bring my friend to the hospital.

380
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,320
How is your friend?

381
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,880
It's bad.

382
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,120
Nubdao, I need to talk to the nurse.
I'll call you later.

383
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,440
Ma'am!

384
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,800
Yada!

385
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,760
- I'm scared!
- Yada, it's me.

386
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,080
- No!
- Yada, look at me.

387
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,800
- No!
- Yada, calm down.

388
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,240
Yada, get yourself together. Look at me.

389
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,760
It's me.

390
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,080
I'm here.

391
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,000
Kim…

392
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,720
What did Mr. Kim say?

393
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,480
He said his friend is seriously ill,
so he had to stay at the hospital.

394
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,720
A friend?

395
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,120
Mhm.

396
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,840
A guy or a girl?

397
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,600
I didn't ask.

398
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,040
Why not?

399
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,560
Because I don't need to know.

400
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,080
Okay, let's eat then.

401
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,920
Go ahead. I'm not hungry.

402
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,920
Are you losing your appetite
because someone isn't here?

403
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,040
And can't you eat alone

404
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,640
because someone didn't drop you home?

405
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,920
I'll go get some rice.

406
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,120
Pu, how are Nubdao and Namfah doing?

407
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,760
Your daughters?

408
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,440
They're doing great,
physically and mentally.

409
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,160
Their house is never empty.

410
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,760
What do you mean?

411
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,160
Both your daughters are about to be taken.

412
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,400
- Someone's flirting with them?
- Of course.

413
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,000
Mr. Kimhan is after Nubdao,

414
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,000
and Mr. Pathawee is after Namfah.

415
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,440
Both sons of Taychit?

416
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,280
Relax, sis.

417
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,560
Those two seem decent.
They won't turn out like their father.

418
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,960
How well do you know them?

419
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,600
I know enough.

420
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,240
But I do know for sure
your daughters are happier than ever.

421
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,040
And what if Taychit finds out
they're my daughters?

422
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,600
Sis…

423
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,080
How would he find out?

424
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,040
Even those two kids don't know
their mother is here drinking soy milk.

425
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,720
If I keep my mouth shut,
no one will ever know.

426
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,840
I'm good at keeping secrets.

427
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,200
If there's money,

428
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,800
my mouth will be shut even tighter.

429
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,880
Got a wart?

430
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,440
Money.

431
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,320
Come on. Hurry up, sis.

432
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,960
I'll keep my mouth shut.

433
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,400
Two hundred? That's not enough
to keep my mouth shut.

434
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,400
Are you blackmailing me?

435
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,600
No, just asking for a hundred more.

436
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,840
Perfect. Now it's an even split.

437
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,760
Good morning.

438
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,680
You're not dressed yet?

439
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,960
Are you seriously

440
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,800
wearing shorts to the office?

441
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,480
As an executive, that's not approved.

442
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,760
I'm wearing this to stay home.

443
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,880
I may not need
executive approval for that.

444
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,200
Today is my day off.

445
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,600
How could I forget?

446
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,160
Maybe I really didn't get enough sleep.

447
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,400
You really should rest.

448
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,000
Otherwise, you'll end up
hospitalized like your friend.

449
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,400
How is your friend doing?

450
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,360
Still not great.

451
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,800
Poor thing. It must be tough being alone.

452
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,480
That's why I need to take care of them.

453
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,320
So, I might have less time
for you these days.

454
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,920
Alright.

455
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,080
But no matter how busy I get,

456
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,160
I still love you the same.

457
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,840
INTRARAT HOSPITAL

458
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,440
I told you not to follow me.

459
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,560
I'm here to visit your friend too.

460
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,000
Do you know my friend?

461
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,120
I don't.

462
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,040
That's why I came to meet them.

463
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,920
Your friends are my friends, right?

464
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,440
Nonsense!

465
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,160
You're with the patient, right?

466
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,280
Yes, I am.

467
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,920
I'd like to recommend
that she see a psychiatrist.

468
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,280
Is something wrong, Doctor?

469
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,840
Right now,

470
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,280
her physical injuries
suggest two possibilities.

471
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,280
Either she was assaulted

472
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,320
or she harmed herself.

473
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,120
No way. She wouldn't hurt herself.

474
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,280
Well…

475
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,120
She has some situations at home.

476
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,920
<i>Even so, I strongly suggest</i>
<i>she sees a psychiatrist.</i>

477
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,960
<i>And in the meantime, she should</i>
<i>have someone watching over her closely.</i>

478
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,560
Aunt Ratree?

479
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,320
Oh.

480
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,080
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

481
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,000
What brings you here?

482
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,880
I was just delivering desserts.

483
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,640
What a coincidence running into you.

484
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,240
It's been so long.

485
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,360
Yes,

486
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,160
it's been so long.

487
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,080
How's your sister?

488
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,720
She's at work. I'm off today.

489
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,560
I'm so happy to see you again.

490
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,720
Me too.

491
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,280
Thank you, dear.

492
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,280
You have a lovely home.

493
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,240
Do you live here with just your sister?

494
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,560
And our uncle.

495
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,040
Where is he then?

496
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,320
He went to his friend's house
and hasn't come back yet.

497
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,600
So, he left you alone at night?

498
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,040
It's safe here.

499
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,120
Don't worry.

500
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,200
Sis.

501
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,880
You need that 300 baht back that badly?

502
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,640
One, two, three.

503
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,440
Thank God it's all here.

504
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,720
- Are you sure it's all here?
- Yes!

505
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,040
You little brat!

506
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,440
You scared me!

507
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,800
Aunt Ratree.

508
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,480
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

509
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,000
I missed you so much.
How did you end up here?

510
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,200
Nub, who's this?

511
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,280
This is Aunt Ratree.

512
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,720
And this is Uncle Pu.

513
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,120
Uncle Pu, nice to meet you.

514
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Nice to meet you too, Aunt Ratree.

515
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,760
Just call me "sis".

516
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,120
It's easier, isn't it?

517
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,160
Ratree is quite long.

518
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,600
Sure, sis.

519
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,240
Wow, so brave of you to call her that.

520
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,080
Honestly, Uncle Pu,
you look older than her.

521
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,480
- You mean in age?
- In face.

522
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,880
- He's quite funny.
- Yes, he is.

523
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,680
You didn't tell me

524
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,040
why you ended up here yet.

525
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,640
Oh, I was delivering desserts
for a customer nearby,

526
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,360
and I just happened
to run into your sister.

527
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,280
What a coincidence.

528
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,760
Aunt Ratree will be staying
for dinner with us tonight.

529
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,120
That's great!

530
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,000
The whole family's together again. Great.

531
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,960
Did you say anything?

532
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,320
Oh, I was just saying I'm hungry.

533
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,480
I'm starving, actually.

534
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,480
Sure, after staying
all night at a friend's house.

535
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,000
But I still have all my money.

536
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,120
Poor thing.

537
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,280
It's just simple food today.

538
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,000
It all looks delicious.

539
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,280
If you visit us again,

540
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,600
I'll cook a special meal just for you.

541
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,600
I can help you in the kitchen too.

542
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,200
Really?

543
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,520
So, that means
you'll be visiting again, right?

544
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,440
That's wonderful.

545
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,840
Uncle, what's wrong?

546
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,360
I'm just emotional.

547
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,640
It's been so long since we had
such a guest at our table.

548
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,640
But if you come next time,

549
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,080
let me know in advance
so I can prepare properly.

550
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,840
Of course, Uncle Pu.

551
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,640
So you don't abandon your nieces at night.

552
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,840
Oh, it's normal by now.

553
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,960
Uncle Pu raised us like this
since we were kids.

554
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,920
- We're used to it.
- Really, Uncle Pu?

555
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,320
Namfah! How could you
expose me in front of…

556
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,040
someone else like this.

557
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,760
But Aunt Ratree isn't someone else.

558
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,600
She's someone important to me.

559
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,960
Oh, well, Namfah.

560
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,400
I take care of you both all these years,

561
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,280
and the second she walks in,
she's suddenly the hero?

562
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,640
Fine, why don't you just call her
"mother" while you're at it?

563
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,000
Oh, that's a good idea actually.

564
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,040
Can we, Aunt Ratree?

565
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,200
Namfah, get some rice for Aunt Ratree.

566
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,320
Sure.

567
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,800
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

568
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,200
You're so slow.

569
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,760
Alright.

570
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,920
Hurry up.

571
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,120
- Thank you.
- Wait a second, Uncle Pu.

572
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,720
Here you go.

573
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,600
Also this one.

574
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,480
Alright, I'll take the bone out for you.

575
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,400
<i>Tell me. In what capacity</i>
<i>do you expect me to return to my children?</i>

576
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,080
I've never even been
a good mother to them.

577
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,240
<i>Namfah, are you having trouble</i>
<i>with Mr. Pathawee?</i>

578
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,200
No.

579
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,280
It's been two weeks
since we officially became a couple.

580
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,840
Let's go on a date tonight.

581
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,960
I'm the only one who remembers, aren't I?

582
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,360
You're my first boyfriend.

583
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,920
So, I don't know what dates
I'm supposed to remember.

584
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,120
<i>Miss Yada finished her meal</i>
<i>and then fell asleep.</i>

585
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,520
<i>So, I went to the restroom.</i>

586
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,560
<i>But when I returned, she was gone.</i>

587
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,320
<i>If we don't trust each other,</i>
<i>how can we continue?</i>

588
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,240
Like you and me, right?

589
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,040
- What do you mean?
- I love you.

590
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,080
And I trust you too.

591
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,400
Pick up the phone.

592
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,320
She might disappear again.

593
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,160
