1
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
You might not get to have dinner
with the Mystery Chef, just with me.

2
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,920
You decorated this place so nicely.
What's the special occasion?

3
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
A special guest is coming
to have dinner with Nubdao.

4
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
<i>You don't eat spicy food either.</i>

5
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
I've eaten it for him, Namfah.

6
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,880
You knew that?

7
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,440
And I also know
why you ate it instead of me.

8
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,560
<i>I respect Nubdao's decision.</i>

9
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
I don't want to put her
in a difficult position.

10
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,240
- Can I cancel our deal?
- Of course.

11
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,000
So, you'll be the project leader.

12
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
<i>Come up with a special dish</i>

13
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>within two weeks.</i>

14
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,800
All of my time belongs to you alone.

15
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,200
No matter if it's good times or bad times,

16
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,080
the sunlight will always be near you.

17
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,160
I hope you're doing well.

18
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,720
Nubdao.

19
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,920
Lungo coffee, your favorite.

20
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Aren't you going to have a sip?

21
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,600
I made this for you myself.

22
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,240
It's the same coffee,
but brewed by a different person, Yada.

23
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,080
Even if the barista changes,
the rich aroma

24
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,920
and intensity

25
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,920
might make you reconsider and come back
to the coffee you used to love.

26
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,920
Thanks for the effort for this old friend.

27
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,440
But I won't go back
to drinking the same coffee again.

28
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,320
You come early every day
just to flirt with Kim over coffee?

29
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,600
Were you talking to me?

30
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,920
Is there anyone else here?

31
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
If the coffee is good, you don't need
to flirt. He'll drink it anyway.

32
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,280
Aren't you Mr. Pathawee's secretary?

33
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,799
Then why aren't you bringing
that cup to your own boss?

34
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,400
Did Ms. Yada bring you coffee?

35
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
She did,

36
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
but I didn't drink it.

37
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,360
Aren't you going to ask why?

38
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,320
Even without drinking it, I'd still
get in trouble with someone. If I had,

39
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,960
I'd be dead by now.

40
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,800
This… This is my favorite cup.

41
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,720
We've reached a consensus.

42
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,640
- We've decided on…
- Tom Yum Goong!

43
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Why this dish?

44
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,680
Because Tom Yum Goong
is a globally recognized dish.

45
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
It's practically
a signature of Thai cuisine,

46
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,960
with a rich and distinctive taste.

47
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
It won't be overshadowed
when fused with other culinary traditions.

48
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,240
It has its own characteristics.

49
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,520
Anyone who tastes it will
immediately understand and appreciate it.

50
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,600
And what is your Tom Yum soup

51
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
preparation technique?

52
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
<i>We start by roasting the prawn heads</i>

53
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,880
<i>and shells until it's completely dry.</i>

54
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,880
<i>Then we add tomato paste</i>
<i>and cook until well combined.</i>

55
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,720
<i>Adds chopped onions, celery,</i>

56
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,560
<i>lemongrass, galangal,</i>
<i>and kaffir lime leaves, then fry them.</i>

57
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,400
<i>Then add water.</i>

58
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,480
<i>Bring the broth to a boil</i>
<i>and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.</i>

59
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,600
<i>Blend until smooth,</i>
<i>then strain to get a clear broth.</i>

60
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
<i>Let it reduce by a third</i>
<i>to concentrate the flavors.</i>

61
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,000
<i>Add a bit of finely ground chili paste</i>

62
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,600
<i>to enhance the Tom Yum flavor,</i>

63
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,240
<i>then stir until fully dissolved.</i>

64
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,680
<i>Add a bit of cooking cream</i>

65
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,800
<i>to balance out the strong flavors</i>
<i>from the prawn heads and shells.</i>

66
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
<i>Enhance the aroma with lemon zest.</i>

67
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,920
<i>Balance the flavors with halved lemons,</i>

68
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,760
<i>salt, and a touch of sugar.</i>
<i>Bring to a boil,</i>

69
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,760
<i>then turn off the heat. Remove the lemons</i>
<i>before straining the broth one final time.</i>

70
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,480
<i>If the consistency is too thin,</i>

71
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,560
<i>add a tiny amount of cornstarch slurry</i>
<i>to stabilize it.</i>

72
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,480
<i>Finally, we finish</i>
<i>with a knob of chilled butter</i>

73
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,680
<i>to add richness</i>
<i>and a silky mouthfeel before serving.</i>

74
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,960
Now we have

75
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,120
a concentrated French-style Tom Yum broth.

76
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,600
But these techniques
come with their own challenges.

77
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
Like what?

78
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,400
KEY CHALLENGES

79
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,000
Here are the key challenges.

80
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
One, we need to control the roasting
of the prawn heads and shells precisely.

81
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,560
You put oil in it.

82
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,880
If undercooked, the broth will be fishy.

83
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,080
If overcooked, it'll turn bitter.

84
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,280
BALANCING FLAVOR

85
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,880
Two, we have to be careful

86
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,840
not to make the broth too Thai,

87
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,680
since it will overpower
the French influence.

88
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,000
Lastly…

89
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,720
This is very important.

90
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,240
If we want to put butter in it,
it's a Western way of cooking,

91
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,760
we have to incorporate it
gradually into the hot broth,

92
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,320
stirring in rhythm.

93
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,840
Otherwise, the butter
will separate and float on top.

94
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Understood.

95
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
- Got it.
- Got it.

96
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,840
Too fishy. The prawn shells
weren't roasted enough. Start over.

97
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,360
- Got it!
- Got it!

98
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,720
Abracadabra! I hope we pass this time!

99
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,880
It smells good.

100
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,400
It's bitter. Over-roasted.
The heat was too high.

101
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,680
Start over.

102
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

103
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,520
Are you sure you'll finish in time?

104
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,240
Yes.

105
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,320
If you can't make it, let me know.
I can assign someone else.

106
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,480
I have plenty of other easy tasks
for you to prove yourself.

107
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,360
It's alright. I can do it.

108
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,720
I know you won't disappoint me.

109
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,840
The Chairman himself came
to personally encourage his favorite son?

110
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,079
Why? Afraid he might fail
and disappoint you?

111
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,319
Pathawee already promised me.

112
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,720
He'll never disappoint me.

113
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,839
Then I'll be sure
to cheer him on from the sidelines.

114
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,800
If he succeeds,

115
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,160
it will not only be
a triumph for our hotel,

116
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,680
but also prove to the Board
that he has a talent

117
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,840
that you clearly lack.

118
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,800
And the Board will see just how obviously

119
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,360
you favor one vice president
over the other, right?

120
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,600
Exactly.

121
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,200
- Smells as good as ever.
- Agreed.

122
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,840
If you can't make it, let me know.
I can assign someone else.

123
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,080
I have plenty of other easy tasks
for you to prove yourself.

124
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,200
<i>I know you won't disappoint me.</i>

125
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,560
Why is it still bitter?

126
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
Why does it keep turning out like this?

127
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Right? I swear
I managed the flames properly.

128
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,040
My hand is cramping

129
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,680
from stirring so precisely,
and it's still bitter?

130
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,040
Maybe we should start from the beginning?

131
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,000
Go home.

132
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,120
- But we're--
- I said go home!

133
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,560
Yes, sir.

134
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,400
I've never seen
Mr. Pathawee like this before.

135
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,840
Yeah.

136
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,640
He's usually calm, but that was scary.

137
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,240
Because you didn't watch
the heat properly.

138
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,680
- It's because you didn't roast it well.
- Me?

139
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,640
Yes, you.

140
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,080
- It's you.
- Stop!

141
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,840
Could it be…

142
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,720
What was that about?

143
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
Maybe…

144
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,480
it wasn't you and me?

145
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,480
- Enough.
- What are you talking about?

146
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Mr. Wee.

147
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,600
- Why are you still here?
- Because I just realized something.

148
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,800
I asked why.

149
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,720
What if the bitterness
isn't from burnt shells?

150
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,640
Then what is it from?

151
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,320
Is it possible that it's bitter
because we over-boiled the broth?

152
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,920
Yes, that's right.

153
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Thank you, Namfah.

154
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,120
How long have we been boiling it?

155
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,520
Twenty minutes.

156
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,560
Set the timer for 18 minutes.

157
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Turn it off now.

158
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,040
Still bitter.

159
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,920
- Reduce the time.
- Got it.

160
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,440
It's still bitter. Reduce the time again.

161
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,760
Got it.

162
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,480
Mr. Wee!

163
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,680
Smile. It's almost time.

164
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
No bitterness!

165
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,800
Yes!

166
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,720
- No more bitterness!
- Be careful.

167
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,720
No bitterness!

168
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
It's not bitter anymore!

169
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,040
So, we passed the first challenge, right?

170
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,840
Yes. I forgot

171
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,560
that if prawn shells are boiled
too long, they release ammonia,

172
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,280
which makes the broth taste bitter.

173
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,880
You were too stressed.

174
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,280
It happens when you pressure
yourself too much.

175
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,280
That's why the Mystery Chef says
we have to enjoy cooking.

176
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,680
Otherwise, the food won't turn out right.

177
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Right.

178
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,480
So, in the next steps,

179
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,320
don't be stressed
and don't pressure yourself.

180
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,040
Alright.

181
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,080
Let's go, then. I'll drive you home.

182
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,520
Okay.

183
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,240
- Here's your water.
- Thanks.

184
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,280
You can leave first if you want.

185
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,080
I'd rather stay…

186
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,000
and keep you company.

187
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Where's the clock I gave you?

188
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,880
It's over there.

189
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,400
Where? I don't see it.

190
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Right there.

191
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,320
You pretended not to see it?

192
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,080
Oh, Namfah, you're here already?

193
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,800
Nope. Still on my way.

194
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,600
Hello, Mr. Kimhan.

195
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,240
I'm glad…

196
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
you brought her home.

197
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm heading out first.

198
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,320
Okay.

199
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,120
It smells good.

200
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,360
My favorite cup of coffee.

201
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,600
What are you doing here?

202
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,960
Visiting my girlfriend.

203
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,320
Can't I?

204
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,800
What if someone sees us?

205
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
It's still early. No one's here yet.

206
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,680
How was your morning?

207
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,320
Traffic wasn't too bad today.

208
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,120
Same here!
The highway was pretty empty too.

209
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,880
But it's good we're here early.

210
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,560
Now we can enjoy coffee and do our makeup.

211
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,360
True, but the lighting here isn't great.

212
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,880
You're right.

213
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,720
Let's go to the restroom first.
We'll grab coffee later.

214
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,040
Coffee?

215
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

216
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,400
They want coffee?

217
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,040
Wait! Someone else might come.
Let me check first.

218
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,720
What are you doing down there?

219
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,800
Uh… Fixing a pipe leak.

220
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,320
How bad? I can help.

221
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,880
Uh, no, it's fine! It's fixed already!

222
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,120
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

223
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,960
You fixed it yourself?

224
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,880
Yes.

225
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,480
Wow, a woman
as pretty as you fixing pipes?

226
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,600
Lucky will be the guy who dates you.

227
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,400
Do you have a boyfriend?

228
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
No, I don't.

229
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,160
Oh.

230
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,640
You're single. I'm single. We're single.

231
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,480
Can I get your LINE?

232
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,760
Oh, my boss is calling.

233
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,840
Why didn't you tell him
you have a boyfriend?

234
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,920
I think we nailed the first challenge.

235
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,160
I'm pretty sure we got the second one too.

236
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,680
Yeah.

237
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,200
Let me try.

238
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,120
Here, go ahead.

239
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,880
Be careful. It's hot.

240
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,080
It tastes way too Thai.

241
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,240
Still not there?

242
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,520
The Thai flavors are overpowering.

243
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,920
There's no French influence.

244
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,800
Namfah, let me see your notes.

245
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,880
Here it is.

246
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,000
Yes, Mom?

247
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,600
What do you want me to do?

248
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,200
I'm still at work.

249
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,240
Namfah.

250
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,280
The aroma is there.

251
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,720
We've brought back the French influence.

252
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,160
- Really?
- Yes!

253
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,040
Namfah, try it.

254
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,840
Does that mean

255
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,320
we passed the second challenge?

256
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,480
Yes.

257
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,240
Yeah!

258
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,200
Woo!

259
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,040
Can I taste it?

260
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,800
Let me try too.

261
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,640
Wow, it's good.

262
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,040
Let me try.

263
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,120
Wow.

264
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,760
You spent days perfecting just the soup.

265
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,680
Are you sure you'll finish in time?

266
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,240
Yes, I'm sure.

267
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,400
Good.

268
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,680
Ah, the embassy is calling.

269
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,880
I'll confirm the presentation date now.

270
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,520
Alright.

271
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,280
Are you worried about something?

272
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
It's the presentation. I'm not good at it.

273
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,000
Just explain it step by step.
I know you can do it.

274
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,440
I'll try.

275
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,639
I'm so lucky

276
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,199
to have a great team.
The kitchen work is tough,

277
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,920
but even someone as small as Namfah

278
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,719
is handling it with determination.
She never complains.

279
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,639
And she lifts everyone's spirits.

280
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,240
That sounds like fun.

281
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,080
It's so fun, and I'm so happy, Mom.

282
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,240
Mr. Wee is incredible.

283
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,360
How?

284
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,400
Whenever there's a problem,
he fixes it right away.

285
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,200
I never expected someone like him
to be this skilled.

286
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,680
You should see him cook.

287
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,440
It's so cool!

288
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,760
If he's that good. It sounds like
he'll take the Mystery Chef's place.

289
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,480
No way!

290
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,400
The Mystery Chef is always my number one.

291
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,920
No one can top him.

292
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,400
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

293
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,480
Everyone's busy with the banquet
in the main kitchen,

294
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,200
so I'm the only assistant today.

295
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,960
Got it.

296
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,000
So, we're at the final step
of making the soup?

297
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,640
Yes. For this step,
you have to be very patient.

298
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,840
Make sure the butter doesn't float.

299
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,440
Fah.

300
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,400
Don't rush.

301
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,360
I have to add it one piece at a time?

302
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,240
Yes, we need to blend it in fully

303
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,200
before adding more.

304
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,320
This is another

305
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,320
French technique, isn't it,

306
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,080
Mystery Chef?

307
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,440
Yes.

308
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,440
You have to stir in sync,

309
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,160
or else the butter will float.

310
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,600
It smells amazing, Mystery Chef.

311
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,600
Yes, it does.

312
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,280
Namfah.

313
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,160
Yes, Mystery Chef?

314
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,640
Namfah, stop stirring.

315
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Add the next piece of butter.

316
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,720
Got it.

317
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,720
Slowly.

318
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,400
What are you working on?

319
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,640
Presentation notes,
but they're still a mess.

320
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,200
Are you the one presenting?

321
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,360
No, I'm just helping Mr. Wee research.

322
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,720
With good notes and preparation,

323
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,600
it should be fine for him.

324
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,800
But he told me
he's not confident in presentations.

325
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,280
It'd be great if someone good
at presenting could help him.

326
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,960
I won't be able to go home
with you this evening.

327
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,320
Why? Where are you going?
I'll take you there.

328
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,560
Hey.

329
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm going to check in
on Mr. Pathawee and Namfah.

330
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,400
Do you want to come along?

331
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,680
I'd better not.
Wee wouldn't want me near him.

332
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,120
I think he'd actually be happy

333
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,600
if his brother came to support him.

334
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,600
You did well yesterday.
That was a good start.

335
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,520
I just wanted to make you happy,
that's all.

336
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,720
And it made you happy too, didn't it?

337
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,640
Try it.

338
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,000
Let's try it.

339
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,600
- Rich and creamy.
- The sourness is just right.

340
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,400
- Perfect balance of saltiness.
- And a light aroma of pepper.

341
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,720
Great.

342
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,480
Need any help?

343
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,000
Nubdao, help try this.

344
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,320
Sure. What is it?

345
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,720
A key ingredient for the dish.

346
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,240
Give it a taste.

347
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,720
Sure.

348
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,080
Nubdao.

349
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
Did you invite him?

350
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,720
Very smooth.
I can really taste the kaffir lime.

351
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,160
Why don't you let Mr. Kimhan try?

352
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,560
- Alright.
- No need.

353
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,520
Nubdao, get it for me.

354
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Sure.

355
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,160
How is it?

356
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,120
Very smooth.

357
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,800
Do you need more help?

358
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,120
Yes, a lot.

359
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,160
Excuse me.

360
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,200
Come here. There's a lot to do.

361
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,120
A lot?

362
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,000
I'll go help over there.

363
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,320
Nope.

364
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,440
We're not done yet.

365
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,040
Wrap it properly, or it will smell.

366
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,360
Excuse me, Mr. Kimhan.

367
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,320
I'll wait outside.

368
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,120
Okay.

369
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,440
Nubdao, what's Mr. Kimhan doing?

370
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,840
Shape the dough properly.

371
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,560
Got it.

372
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,840
I'd like to introduce our Thai River Prawn

373
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,880
Tom Yum Bisque.

374
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,400
We first sauté the prawn heads and shells

375
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,400
with brandy until dry,

376
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,000
then add onions,

377
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,480
celery, Japanese scallions,

378
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,120
galangal, lemongrass,
and kaffir lime leaves.

379
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,120
We sauté them,

380
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,560
then blend and strain the mixture,

381
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,080
then reduce the broth to one-third.

382
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,400
Everyone, please enjoy.

383
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,560
Please, go ahead.

384
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,400
Feels like it's missing something, right?

385
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,040
I'd like you to try adding
a touch of this sour cream

386
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,240
and tasting the soup again.

387
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,960
The Thai Tom Yum essence remains strong,

388
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,760
yet there's a refined,
smooth texture, like a French bisque.

389
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,960
That's thanks
to the French cooking technique.

390
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,720
We blend chilled butter into the hot broth

391
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,560
for extra aroma and a smooth texture.

392
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,400
So, the more sour cream you add,

393
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,200
the deeper the Tom Yum flavor becomes?

394
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,280
Exactly.

395
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,040
Very innovative.
It's a beautifully balanced

396
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,520
Thai-French Tom Yum bisque.

397
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,120
And absolutely delicious.

398
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,720
To make this dish even more exceptional,

399
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,960
I recommend pairing it with this.

400
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,160
Why don't you pair it with rice?

401
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,400
I believe that if we try

402
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,800
pairing the bisque with bread,

403
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,680
it might create a fresh,

404
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,560
unexpected experience.

405
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,760
I chose three-colored bread

406
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,800
to incorporate elements
from Thailand's four regions

407
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,320
into this dish.

408
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,920
That sounds interesting.

409
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,480
Can you elaborate a little more?

410
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,040
Sure. I chose the Ayutthaya river prawn,

411
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,320
which symbolizes the abundance

412
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,080
of Thailand's central rivers.

413
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,640
That's the key ingredient of the dish.

414
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,560
For the three-colored bread
that I serve with the soup,

415
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,440
I've made it
with three regional rice varieties.

416
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,880
The first layer is made from
"Forget Husband" rice from the North.

417
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,600
The second layer comes from
sticky green rice from the Northeast,

418
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,280
while the third

419
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,880
uses Sangyod rice from the South.

420
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,920
That's an excellent idea.

421
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,840
Pairing it with the soup
will enhance the flavors even more.

422
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,400
This is an outstanding dish.

423
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,760
It seamlessly blends the uniqueness
of Thailand's four regions

424
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,200
with the elegance of French cuisine.

425
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,640
I'm confident our VIP guests
will be highly impressed.

426
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,000
We're delighted to collaborate with you.

427
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,640
Thank you very much.

428
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,760
We greatly appreciate this opportunity.

429
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,360
- Sure.
- The pleasure is ours.

430
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,880
Thank you so much.

431
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,200
You did an excellent job.

432
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,680
Thank you, Father.

433
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,200
Hooray!

434
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,080
- I was on edge the whole time, Mr. Wee.
- You nailed that presentation.

435
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,240
You were amazing, Mr. Wee!

436
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,240
Teach us some of those
presentation tricks, please.

437
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,320
It's all about the three S's. First,

438
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,880
spark interest.

439
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,800
Second, stimulate engagement

440
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,360
Third, surpass expectations.

441
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,320
That three-colored bread
really went beyond expectations,

442
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,960
not just for them but for us too!

443
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,440
That was Namfah's idea.

444
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,960
Namfah, you're incredible!

445
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,120
Tonight, let's celebrate our success.

446
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,280
Come in.

447
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,040
Thank you, Kim.

448
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,960
3S'S PRESENTATION TECHNIQUE
FIRST, SPARK INTEREST

449
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,240
If you hadn't given me those tips,
I wouldn't have passed the presentation.

450
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,680
Selling a dish is one thing,

451
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,120
but if the food isn't good,
it wouldn't have passed.

452
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,040
So, did I pass in your book?

453
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,600
Thank you, really. Thank you.

454
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,960
Why don't you eat at the restaurant?
We have to clean.

455
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,000
Stop complaining, Uncle Pu.
You never helped me and Numdao clean.

456
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,360
Isn't what I'm doing right now helping?

457
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,480
Yes, it is.

458
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,800
You little troublemaker.

459
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,880
- Hurry up.
- I'm on it.

460
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,280
I know.

461
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,600
Anything I can do to help?

462
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,280
Mr. Pathawee. No, no.

463
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,600
Just sit back and enjoy the BBQ.

464
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,200
Here, let me pour you some water.

465
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,440
Come, come, sit down and enjoy.

466
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,160
The grill's ready.

467
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,160
- Here we go!
- Here's your drink.

468
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,680
What about mine, Uncle Pu?

469
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,520
Yours is soda.

470
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,280
I know you too well.

471
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,280
Oh no, I'm so thirsty!

472
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,760
I'm hurrying.

473
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,800
Thank you for helping Pathawee.

474
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,120
I wasn't helping him.
I was helping the hotel.

475
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,840
Yeah.

476
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,840
Either way, you did a great job.

477
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,120
So, did Mr. Pathawee invite you
to the celebration party?

478
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,840
- Yeah.
- Are you going?

479
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,480
The host went out of his way
to invite you. Don't turn him down.

480
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,000
Come with me.

481
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,040
Fine, I'll go…

482
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,800
for your peace of mind.

483
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,120
Thank you.

484
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,040
Let's celebrate!

485
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,920
Cheers!

486
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,360
We made it just in time, right?

487
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,360
Your house is so cozy.
Do you live here with just your sister?

488
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,280
And my uncle too.

489
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,360
It's just touching, you know?

490
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,520
We don't get special guests here often.

491
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,280
Next time, let us know in advance,
so we can prepare properly.

492
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,400
Kim must really like your coffee.

493
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,640
He finished the whole cup.

494
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,840
He had trouble sleeping last night.

495
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,640
He usually sleeps like a log.

496
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,720
Thank you for staying with me all night.

497
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,840
I haven't had much time for you lately.

498
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,080
But even if I have less time,
I still love you just the same.

499
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,320
<i>Are you tired?</i>

500
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,960
A little. But hearing your voice
makes it all better.

501
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,320
