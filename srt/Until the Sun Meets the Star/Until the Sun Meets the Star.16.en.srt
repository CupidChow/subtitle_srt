00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
This message

2
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,160
will never reach the woman
you love, Aran, my dear friend.

3
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,160
<i>That file must've had an important clue.</i>

4
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,480
Or he wouldn’t have erased it.

5
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,520
You forgot what tomorrow is, didn't you?

6
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,880
- What?
- It's Namfah's birthday.

7
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,440
<i>Mr. Wee wanted to tell you himself.</i>

8
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,760
<i>I'm not mad at you.</i>

9
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,840
- I'm just… embarrassed.
- Embarrassed?

10
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,320
- <i>Whose picture is this?</i>
- <i>Do you know anyone in the picture?</i>

11
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,760
When did I ever separate
from Wayha, huh, Pu?

12
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,320
Come on, sis. I had to think fast
when Mr. Kim asked me.

13
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,600
I want him to flirt properly!

14
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,800
You know, like actual flirting.

15
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
I chose the flamingo flower

16
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,000
because it symbolizes steadfast love.

17
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
I won't change my heart.

18
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,560
Your mother isn't dead.

19
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,880
Then why did everyone lie to us
and say she was dead?

20
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
It's my fault

21
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,280
for lying to them from the start.

22
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,960
This place is beautiful.

23
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
My dad once told me

24
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
he brought my mom here
when she was pregnant with me.

25
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,160
Why did my parents

26
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,320
name me after something
so distant, so faint?

27
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,560
Doesn't it sound lonely to you?

28
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
It may be true that

29
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,040
starlight isn't the brightest.

30
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,200
But in the darkest of times,

31
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,480
it shines like a beacon of hope

32
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,960
for those who need it.

33
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,360
I know you're confused right now,

34
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,600
but you don't have to rush
into a decision.

35
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,920
Just take your time.

36
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,800
Think it through.

37
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
There was a time

38
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,840
I was angry at my mother, too.

39
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,280
She left when I was a kid.

40
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Left me longing for her.

41
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,880
But if people had a choice,

42
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
no one would willingly leave
the ones they love behind, Nubdao.

43
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
But I've decided.

44
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,520
I chose to accept that my mother was gone.

45
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,520
Get some rest, okay?

46
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
Thank you.

47
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
I made you coffee.

48
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,320
Try it.

49
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,440
How's my Lungo coffee?

50
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,960
It's okay,

51
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,000
but if you want it to be better,

52
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,680
the crema should be thicker
and more velvety.

53
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,200
The bitterness isn't quite balanced.
How long did you pull the shot for?

54
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
It's…

55
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,280
that bad?

56
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
Since we're at the beach,

57
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
shall we swim?

58
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,600
I'd rather not.

59
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,480
Then, what about building a sandcastle?

60
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,040
Do you want to?

61
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,160
Let's have a race.

62
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,600
First one to reach that spot over there…

63
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,080
wins!

64
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,680
Aren't you tired?

65
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,520
This is nothing.

66
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,440
I've been through way worse.

67
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,840
But from now on,

68
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
you don't have to tire
yourself out anymore.

69
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
Because…

70
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,560
- Mr. Kim?
- I'll carry the burden for you.

71
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,680
Put me down, Mr. Kim!

72
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,040
What are you doing?

73
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,440
Taking off my shirt. It's wet.

74
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,360
And you're doing that right here?

75
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,680
Why not? We're at the beach.
Am I not allowed?

76
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,080
I'm going to shower.

77
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,760
Don't take too long, okay?
I've got somewhere I want to take you.

78
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,840
Nubdao just called. She's with Mr. Kim,
so there's nothing to worry about.

79
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,960
And…

80
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
did you tell her you're with me?

81
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,280
And…

82
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
she also doesn't have to worry.

83
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,000
This temple is beautiful.

84
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,920
There's a tunnel beneath the main hall.

85
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,720
Really?

86
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,800
Back in the day,
the sea used to flood this area often.

87
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,920
Instead of tearing the temple down,

88
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,720
they decided

89
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,480
to lift it higher instead.

90
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,160
I think it's even stronger now
than it was before.

91
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,080
It makes the temple

92
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,840
look stronger and more stable.

93
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,800
For things that already fell apart,

94
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,920
can we really rebuild them

95
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,200
and make them stronger and more stable?

96
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480
It depends

97
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,080
on how much we're willing
to accept the mistakes of the past

98
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
and learn from them.

99
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,040
Whisper your wish into its left ear
while covering its right ear.

100
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,359
Whisper your wish into its right ear
while covering its left ear.

101
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,200
Do you know why?

102
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,200
Because it's believed that the wish
won't slip out through the other ear.

103
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,480
What did you wish for?

104
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,640
I wished for you
to be happy every single day.

105
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
Thank you.

106
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,680
Do you want to make a wish too?

107
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
What did you wish for?

108
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,880
It feels great

109
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,760
making merit with you.

110
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,120
Maybe in our next lives,
we'll be together again.

111
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,240
I'm not thinking about the next life yet.
Just focus on surviving this one first.

112
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,840
Are you hungry?

113
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,520
Let's find something delicious to eat.

114
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,520
Shall we?

115
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,880
Sure.

116
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,520
Here you go.

117
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,960
Thank you.

118
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
I wish Namfah was here too.

119
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,600
She would've loved the seafood.

120
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
True.

121
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
If Wee was here,

122
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,480
we'd be eating a lot of good food.

123
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,800
You're already eating a lot.

124
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,480
My girlfriend peeled them for me.
How could I not eat them?

125
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,320
Can I have more?

126
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,080
Yes, Mr. Wee?

127
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,800
Nubdao said she's almost home.

128
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
Oh! She's here! I'll talk to you later.

129
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,840
Nubdao!

130
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,920
The one who kept these photos

131
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,760
is not me.

132
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,480
That person has been watching
over you both as you grew up.

133
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,880
It was the only thing

134
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,160
that kept her going for over 20 years.

135
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,120
If this is too much for you,

136
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,520
we can just live like we always have.

137
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,960
Dad lied to us about Mom,

138
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,840
but there's one thing he didn't lie about.

139
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,800
<i>Your mother never really left.</i>

140
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,320
<i>She's up there,</i>

141
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,440
<i>on one of the stars in the sky.</i>

142
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,400
<i>And if you're a good girl,</i>

143
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,440
<i>the angels will send her back to you.</i>

144
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,640
Miracles do exist.

145
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
Uncle Pu.

146
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
Yes?

147
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,760
Can you take us to see Aunt Ratree?

148
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,960
Of course.

149
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,120
Thank you. Here you go.

150
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,440
Thank you.

151
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,800
NOODLES

152
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,920
You know what? That photo frame

153
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,440
was from Aunt Ratree. She made it herself.

154
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,200
Mr. Wee, I'll be meeting
Aunt Ratree tomorrow.

155
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
Are you happy?

156
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,400
Stay like that.

157
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,840
What are you taking a picture of?

158
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,400
My first picture
of my girlfriend on my phone.

159
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,600
And about your mother…
What does Nubdao think?

160
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,320
I still don't know what she's thinking.

161
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,440
I see.

162
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,440
No matter what you decide,

163
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
I'll always be by your side.

164
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm sorry for leaving you.

165
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,800
I'm sorry…

166
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,720
for…

167
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,160
not being there to take care of you.

168
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm sorry…

169
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,680
for making you suffer.

170
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
I'm sorry…

171
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,680
for lying.

172
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,480
I…

173
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,920
- I'm sorry--
- You don't have to explain.

174
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,840
I know

175
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,200
you've been watching over us all along.

176
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm sorry

177
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
that I wasn't there for you
when you were suffering.

178
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,720
Crybaby.

179
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,200
You said

180
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,360
you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with us.

181
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,760
We want the same thing, Mom.

182
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,440
Finally,

183
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,160
the day I've been waiting for has come.

184
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,000
Well, well, well. Now whose job is it?

185
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,920
Seriously.

186
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Don't work your niece so hard.

187
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,800
Whoa, sis.

188
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,600
Hey, Namfah, I think
your mom's legs are numb by now.

189
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,560
I'm giving you the day off today, Nubdao.

190
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,760
- Thank you.
- What about me?

191
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,960
You're off too.

192
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Thank you!

193
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Tomorrow's our day off anyway,

194
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,120
so that means
we get two days off in a row!

195
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,280
How about we take your mother out
for lunch tomorrow?

196
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,760
My treat.

197
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,440
Thank you.

198
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,880
- Thank you.
- Of course.

199
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,840
Mr. Patthawee, Mr. Kimhan.
Can we talk privately?

200
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

201
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,520
I bet she wants to talk
to her future sons-in-law.

202
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,880
But… I'm not even
Mr. Wee's girlfriend yet.

203
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,760
Really?

204
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,800
Sure.

205
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,440
Are you planning
to tell Mr. Taychit about this?

206
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,080
No.

207
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,840
What do you think, Aunt Ratree?

208
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,640
I also think it's best not to tell him.

209
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,960
Our social statuses are worlds apart.

210
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,600
That doesn't matter to me.

211
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
But it will to Mr. Taychit.

212
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,960
And he doesn't like me as it is.

213
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,080
If he finds out that Nubdao and Namfah
are my daughters,

214
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,280
it won't end well.

215
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,560
I also won't tell my daughters

216
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,480
that I worked at your house,

217
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,640
since I'm resigning.

218
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,760
That's a good idea.

219
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I agree.

220
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,320
Did Mr. Kim and Mr. Wee leave?

221
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
Yes. Where's Mom, Uncle Pu?

222
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,600
In the kitchen.

223
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,800
I'm going to see her.

224
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm coming too, Namfah.

225
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,920
These two little ducklings
just keep following their mother!

226
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,560
Mom!

227
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,720
Are you making sour curry?
It smells amazing.

228
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,720
Want to taste?

229
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,760
I'll feed you.

230
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,840
It's so delicious, perfectly balanced!

231
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,440
Namfah, you stole mine!

232
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, you were too slow.

233
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,680
I'll serve two full bowls then.

234
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,720
Make mine a big one, Mom.

235
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,640
- Alright.
- I want a big one too.

236
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,360
Mine should be the biggest.

237
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Oh, is this enough?

238
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,720
Sis, that's a basin! I want the curry.

239
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,440
Nubdao and Namfah look so adorable

240
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,200
when they're sleeping.

241
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,280
You're really doting on each other!

242
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,720
But what about me?

243
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,160
Anyone doting on me?

244
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
- Sis.
- Hmm?

245
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,000
I haven't seen you smile
like this in a long time.

246
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,480
My daughters are my greatest happiness.

247
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,840
See?

248
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960
Happiness is simpler than you think.

249
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,240
You don't have to make things complicated.

250
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
I want this happiness
to be with me for a long time

251
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
It will.

252
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,640
Forever.

253
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm sorry, Ms. Jitree,

254
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
that I have to resign immediately.

255
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,920
You made the right decision
to be with your kids.

256
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Don't let the opportunity slip away.

257
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,000
At our age, time is limited.

258
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,920
We never know what tomorrow will bring.

259
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,080
Yes, ma'am.

260
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
Thank you for your kindness, Ms. Jitree.

261
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,360
Please take care of yourself.

262
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,240
Lately, I've been trying
to let go of things.

263
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,800
I'll leave karma to do its job.

264
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,680
I've done my part.

265
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,840
Now, I just want to live peacefully.

266
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,600
I see.

267
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,920
Oh, wait here for a moment.

268
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,720
Breakfast is ready.
Would you like to eat now?

269
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,400
Please take it to my office.

270
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,520
- Understood.
- Well…

271
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm expecting someone later this morning.

272
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,880
Alright.

273
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,440
<i>Sasi.</i>

274
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Did you forget something?

275
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,440
I don't have much to give you,

276
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,480
but these were my daughter's clothes.

277
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,360
Ms. Jitree.

278
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,960
You've already done so much for me.

279
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,280
This one looks nice.

280
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,360
Or maybe this?

281
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,120
This one looks proper.

282
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,000
Try it on.

283
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,400
You and Jitsuda were about the same size.

284
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,680
It should fit.

285
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,920
Alright, I'll try it on.

286
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,400
See?

287
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,760
It fits perfectly.

288
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,800
You look lovely.

289
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,000
They're yours now.

290
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,720
Alright.

291
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,840
Thank you.

292
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,080
Come visit me sometime.

293
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,640
Of course.

294
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,720
Ms. Jitree.

295
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,880
May I say goodbye
to Ms. Sasi before I leave?

296
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,880
Of course.

297
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,720
But I'll go with you.

298
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,240
- Shall we go now?
- Sure.

299
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,320
When you arrive,
come straight to my office.

300
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,560
Okay.

301
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,440
I thought you had already left for work.

302
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,960
Sign it.

303
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,880
APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION OF DIVORCE

304
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,840
Please don't leave me and our child.

305
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,360
Please don't leave me.

306
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,520
You…

307
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,040
Why wear a dead woman's clothes?

308
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,920
You remember? I thought you had forgotten.

309
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,920
You…

310
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,480
You did this to haunt me, right?

311
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,840
You're ridiculous.

312
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,200
Clothes are just clothes.

313
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,320
They don't come back to life
and haunt people.

314
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,960
But it would be nice
if you dropped dead right now.

315
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,920
Then the people you wronged

316
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,240
could finally be happy.

317
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,480
Get out. Get out of my house!

318
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,400
How dare you bring something
cursed into my home? Get out!

319
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,920
What's going on?

320
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,280
This woman's wearing Jitsuda's clothes.

321
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,760
She wants to haunt me.

322
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,880
Get out!

323
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,720
Leave now!

324
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,680
No need to yell.

325
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,520
Let's go.

326
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,080
- Ratree.
- Yes, ma'am.

327
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,480
I'm going to pray for a while.

328
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,400
Alright.

329
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,800
The land deal on the island you wanted,

330
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,240
I've taken down…

331
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,160
I mean, I've taken care of it, sir.

332
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,520
All of them?

333
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,160
All of them, sir.

334
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,320
You never disappoint me.

335
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,960
So, I--

336
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,440
Your next job is to find out

337
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,560
where this woman, Ratree, came from.

338
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,000
Who she really is,
where she's worked before.

339
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,680
Why does she

340
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,720
seem so close to my wife?

341
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,640
You said the last job was my final one

342
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
and I could leave.

343
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,760
Come on. A job like this

344
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,680
is easy for you. It won't take long.

345
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,120
Well…

346
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,560
But I want to go see my mother.

347
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,800
Then use the money I pay you
and hire someone to look after her.

348
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,840
Well…

349
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,240
It's not the same.

350
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,120
I want to quit.

351
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,640
Finish this job, and then you can leave.

352
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,480
Remember this, Yos.

353
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,040
You can only quit

354
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,080
when I say so.

355
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,320
Mirantee?

356
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,120
I've resigned, Mr. Kimhan.

357
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,320
Alright.

358
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,600
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to work here.

359
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,080
It was my pleasure.

360
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,080
Mom's here.

361
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,880
Are you hungry?

362
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,880
Why did you choose such a fancy place?

363
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,800
Mr. Kim and Mr. Wee picked it.

364
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,640
Then don't order too much.
We don't want to trouble them.

365
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,600
Yes, Mom.

366
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,000
No way, sis.

367
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,040
Namfah,
you know what I like to eat, right?

368
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,160
Order for me, will you?
My English isn't good.

369
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,160
Order a lot. Make it worth it.

370
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,640
This way, Mom.

371
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,720
Let's go!

372
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,800
Thank you.

373
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,240
Come on. Hurry up.

374
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,520
Let's go.

375
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,400
Oh?

376
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,560
Visiting this late?

377
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,640
You must be hungry.

378
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,200
I already ate.

379
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,640
Oh? With whom?

380
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,480
I went with…

381
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,160
my girlfriend.

382
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,880
Girlfriend?

383
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,320
You finally have one for real?

384
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,120
Yes.

385
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,280
Good for you that you already ate.

386
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,720
Ratree already resigned.

387
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,440
I'll find someone new to replace her.

388
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,160
Don't worry.

389
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,760
- Grandma.
- Hmm?

390
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,560
Do you know anything
about someone named Yos?

391
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,240
Why do you ask?

392
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,720
He came to the house this morning.

393
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,160
Yos?

394
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,560
That man does all the dirty work

395
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,160
and cleans up your father's messes.

396
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,800
He sets people up, framing them

397
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,680
without a care

398
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,040
of how it destroys their families.

399
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,160
I saw Yos today.

400
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,400
Where?

401
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,080
At Taychit's house.

402
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,800
Did… Did he recognize you?

403
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,480
I'm not sure.

404
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,320
But he didn't do anything to me.

405
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,360
You need to run, sis. Run!

406
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,800
Where would I even go?

407
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,120
Where could I run to?

408
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,760
That's the problem.

409
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,520
What should we do?

410
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,640
Why is my life never stable?

411
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,320
What should we do?

412
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,760
<i>Your mother was so pitiful.</i>

413
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,840
<i>She was framed and imprisoned.</i>

414
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,960
<i>Yos? That man does all the dirty work</i>

415
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,840
<i>and cleans up your father's messes.</i>

416
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,400
<i>He sets people up, framing them</i>

417
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,080
<i>without a care</i>

418
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,600
<i>of how it destroys their families.</i>

419
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,840
No information at all.

420
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,960
Tawan.

421
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,040
- Let's go together.
- No.

422
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,360
Why not?

423
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,960
I was waiting for you
to go to work together.

424
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,240
Why wait?

425
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,320
Because you're my sister.

426
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,920
Work keeping you busy?

427
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,960
I hardly see you these days.

428
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,360
I miss you.

429
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,280
You miss me?

430
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,840
I go to work and come home every day.

431
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,400
You're the one who's been disappearing.

432
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,280
I heard you've got a new brother now.
Why bother with me anymore?

433
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,080
I have to care about you too.

434
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,400
If I don't, what if someone here sulks?

435
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,440
Who's sulking? I'm not sulking.

436
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,920
- Sulking.
- Not sulking.

437
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,240
Then, why are you pouting?

438
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,600
Come on.

439
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,200
Don't be mad at me.

440
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,640
It's your fault.

441
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,880
You always hang out with him now.

442
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,160
You have reconciled now, right?

443
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,800
You probably love him more than me.

444
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,360
There's no way
I could love anyone more than you.

445
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,400
Hello.

446
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,440
Here.

447
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,440
What's this?

448
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,160
I made lunch for you.

449
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,280
I don't know if you'll like it, though.

450
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,880
If it's from the Mystery Chef,
it's bound to be good.

451
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,040
So many hearts.

452
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,520
Well, I had to make sure
you knew that I'm flirting with you.

453
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,480
‪This afternoon,

454
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,880
I have an interview
with the PR department.

455
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,120
Are you nervous about the questions?

456
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,600
Promtawan is the one interviewing me.

457
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,000
You'll do great.

458
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,640
Good luck!

459
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,320
Thank you.

460
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,960
You're welcome.

461
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,840
Sit down. The interview is about to begin.

462
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,120
Answer properly.

463
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,920
Yes.

464
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,520
This is delicious, Mr. Wee.

465
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,840
You like it too.

466
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,240
Too? Who else likes it?

467
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,120
You're suspicious

468
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,120
about your father, aren't you?

469
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,360
I am too.

470
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,640
And I know exactly
who you need to talk to.

471
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,120
Do you happen to know
someone named Mirantee?

472
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,360
KEEP FIGHTING, MIRANTEE
I HOPE YOU CAN BE A MICHELIN CHEF. ARAN

473
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,120
Ms. Mirantee?

474
