1
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,920
Do you have any proof

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,880
that Mr. Aran truly took his own life
and wasn't murdered?

3
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,960
<i>Here it is. This is Mr. Aran's will,</i>

4
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,480
written before he died.

5
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,320
Congratulations. You've successfully
put yourself in the spotlight.

6
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Nubdao doesn't seek the spotlight.

7
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
But if her success overshadows someone,
that's not her fault.

8
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Today is the day. I have to meet him.

9
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
Fah!

10
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,920
Oh, Dad, be careful, though.

11
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
Once you're no longer useful,

12
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,000
they might turn on you like stray dogs,
biting the hand that once fed them.

13
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
The real problem

14
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,880
is people who pick fights
with everyone without thinking.

15
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,840
Wee!

16
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,240
When the sun sets,

17
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,760
it's time for the stars to shine,
isn't it?

18
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,520
Tell the messenger to wait there.
I'll be out soon.

19
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,040
It's not even urgent.
I could've signed it tomorrow.

20
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Are you okay?

21
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Yes, but what about you?

22
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,080
I'm fine.

23
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Mr. Kimhan, are you sure you're okay?

24
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
You should see a doctor.

25
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,720
It's nothing serious.

26
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm so sorry. This is my fault.

27
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,800
Nubdao.

28
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes?

29
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm glad it was me.

30
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,640
If it had been you,

31
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,080
I'd feel even worse for bringing you here.

32
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,920
When I was little,

33
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,320
every time I got hurt,

34
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
my mom would blow on my wound

35
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,480
and say,

36
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,840
"Heal quickly."

37
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,160
Alright.

38
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,880
Heal quickly.

39
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,440
And from now on,
forget about the painful past,

40
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
little wound.

41
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,880
We just posted
this announcement for a day,

42
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,320
and it's already gone viral.

43
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
What made you decide to bring it back?

44
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,360
Did your dad finally approve?

45
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,280
Dad doesn't know yet.

46
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
I misunderstood him. I thought
he was stopping me from running the page.

47
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Wait.

48
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,040
Then what did you think
he was stopping you from doing?

49
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,480
He thought I was dating you.

50
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,080
He assumed we were more than friends.

51
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,240
Damn, your dad's got good instincts.

52
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,960
Should we just make it official?

53
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
Enough of that.

54
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,480
You look happier than ever
doing this again.

55
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
This page is my whole world.

56
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,559
It's where I can be myself,

57
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,960
do what I love,
without anyone stopping me.

58
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,760
And what if your dad finds out?

59
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,280
My only happiness

60
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,680
will be gone.

61
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Am I not your happiness?

62
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,240
Come on.

63
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,480
The Mystery Chef has to stay a mystery.

64
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,880
- You ready?
- Ready.

65
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,800
Five, four, three, two… Record.

66
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,960
Wait. What about you?
Are you hurt anywhere?

67
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm fine,

68
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,000
but Mr. Kim…

69
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,680
Are you okay?

70
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,120
Yes, but what about you?

71
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,320
I'm fine.

72
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,800
What a hero. Risking his life like that.

73
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,600
Nubdao.

74
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,520
Have you started falling for him?

75
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Falling for what?

76
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,640
Come on. Mr. Kim is serious about you.

77
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,040
If he keeps up surprises like this,

78
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,440
Mr. Pathawee
is so getting left in the dust.

79
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,080
Stop overthinking things. Go to sleep.

80
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,040
So, Mr. Pathawee
still has a chance, right?

81
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,640
<i>When I was little,</i>

82
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,080
<i>if I fell,</i>

83
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,080
my mom would blow on my wounds

84
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,440
and say,

85
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,760
"Heal quickly."

86
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,320
Alright.

87
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,040
Heal quickly.

88
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,520
And from now on,
stop thinking about the painful past,

89
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
little wound.

90
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,280
When will the sun and the stars

91
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,520
finally be together?

92
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,920
Thank you.

93
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
Your coffee, sir.

94
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,760
Your shoulder is still in pain?

95
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,440
It still hurts.

96
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,120
Can you help me?

97
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,800
Of course. What do you need me to do?

98
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,320
Feed me my coffee.

99
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,760
What?

100
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,960
I can't lift it.

101
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,000
It's too hot.

102
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,480
Is there anything on my mouth?

103
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
I thought you said your shoulder hurt.

104
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,080
Well…

105
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,160
It just got better. Like, right now.

106
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,560
You tricked me?

107
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,000
Nubdao…

108
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,040
Nubdao, I wasn't tricking you.

109
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,360
I wasn't trying to trick you.
I was just teasing.

110
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,160
Do you think
that's something to joke about?

111
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,640
I just wanted to know
if you care about me.

112
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,600
And now I know you do.

113
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,160
You're overthinking.

114
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,000
I was just following orders.

115
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
That's all.

116
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,800
The chairman wants to speak with you.

117
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,560
How much trouble are you planning
to bring to Mr. Kimhan?

118
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
Sit down.

119
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,319
Explain this.

120
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,119
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

121
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,000
When will you stop being so reckless?

122
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Look at Pathawee.

123
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,760
He never steps out of line.
He listens to me

124
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,440
and follows orders.

125
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Remember,

126
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,440
you have no right
to tarnish my hotel's reputation.

127
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,120
If you do,

128
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,240
be prepared to step down
from your vice president position.

129
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,240
Nubdao.

130
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Are you okay?

131
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,600
What are you going to do now?

132
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,320
I bet whoever leaked this photo wanted
the higher-ups to put you under scrutiny.

133
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,200
Nubdao.

134
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,040
I hate people who don't know their place.

135
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I can explain, Ms. Sanguansri.

136
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,120
You're putting Nubdao in danger,
all because of that one photo.

137
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,440
And how is that any of your business?

138
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,480
This is between me and Nubdao.

139
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,080
Just the two of us.

140
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,080
I must thank you, Nubdao.

141
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,960
Thanks to you, every employee now knows
that our management team

142
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,480
is brave enough to protect their people.

143
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,960
Don't worry, Ms. Sanguansri.

144
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,960
I ordered all employees
to delete the photo.

145
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
Alright, sir.

146
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I also instructed them
not to share it further.

147
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,680
Of course.
I also already handled that myself.

148
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
Mr. Kimhan, do you realize

149
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,320
that every single employee
is now incredibly proud of you?

150
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,440
Right now, you're practically their hero.

151
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,800
Now, let's see. Which shoulder was it?

152
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,840
The one that got injured

153
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,680
while bravely saving her
with your brave heart?

154
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,480
Left or right?

155
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,920
Oh no!

156
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If it's the right shoulder,
you must have trouble signing checks.

157
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,680
But don't worry, I'll find you a…

158
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,360
A quill pen. Yes. Something light.

159
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,880
Quill… quill… quill… quill… quill…

160
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
Here's some Khao Chae for you, ma'am.

161
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,200
That fragrant candle-smoked aroma.
Smells delicious.

162
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Tasty.

163
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,760
Ever since you started working here,
my appetite has improved tremendously.

164
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,560
Same here. Everything you cook is amazing.

165
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,920
You could be a Michelin-starred chef.

166
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,280
Thank you.

167
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,880
When I was younger,
I dreamed of becoming a chef,

168
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,120
but it never happened.

169
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
It's okay.

170
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,960
I dreamed of being a good daughter,
but I'm not.

171
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,720
Enjoy your meal.

172
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,960
So, you wanted to be a chef?

173
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,440
I can get you to work at the hotel.

174
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,400
That's alright.
I have something else I want to do more.

175
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,560
What is it? Maybe Grandma and I can help.

176
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
To repay the people
who made me who I am today.

177
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
Good.

178
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,800
Never forget those who have helped you.

179
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,280
I hope you succeed
in whatever it is you're planning.

180
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
Thank you.

181
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,960
Good afternoon, Ms. Sasi.

182
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,120
Since I started working here,

183
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,920
I haven't had the chance
to introduce myself yet.

184
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Alright. If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to ask me.

185
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,080
Thank you.

186
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,760
You seem to like white orchids a lot.

187
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,360
I once heard that white orchids
symbolize unconditional love.

188
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,880
Unconditional love…

189
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,040
Yes.

190
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,120
That reminds me of…

191
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,760
What are you doing here?

192
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,120
Nothing, dear.

193
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,800
Go and do whatever you have to.

194
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,920
Yes, sir.

195
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,840
Wait.

196
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,920
If you're going to work here,

197
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,400
you better know who to listen to.

198
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,720
Don't think for a second that
your so-called master can protect you.

199
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,120
Yes, sir. I will remember that.

200
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,920
Nubdao.

201
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
Yes?

202
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,120
There's something
I want to warn you about,

203
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,160
but I'm not sure if I should say it.

204
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,480
Go ahead.

205
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,080
Kim has never been serious about anyone.

206
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,720
That's his personal matter.
It has nothing to do with me.

207
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,320
I'm just worried

208
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,920
that you might get too invested

209
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
and end up getting hurt.

210
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,920
Thank you for your concern,

211
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,120
but I know my place.

212
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,040
Good. Then stop causing trouble for Kim.

213
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,240
The one who should stop causing trouble…

214
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,640
is you,

215
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,600
Yada.

216
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,960
Instead of being "concerned",
maybe you should be congratulating us.

217
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
That'd be the right thing.

218
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,640
Excuse me.

219
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,000
You took that photo
and leaked it, didn't you?

220
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Aren't you jumping to conclusions
a little too quickly?

221
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,200
Ms. Sanguansri sent a messenger
to deliver documents to me.

222
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,240
They were from your department.

223
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,040
And then, Nubdao nearly got injured.

224
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,120
Followed by the leaked photo.

225
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
Quite a coincidence, don't you think?

226
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,960
It's almost like you're determined
to cast me as the villain in your story.

227
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,000
And why would I even do such a thing?

228
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,240
For the thrill.

229
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
Creating drama
is something you're quite skilled at.

230
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,280
The amusement park

231
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,960
sent this formal letter of apology
regarding last night's accident.

232
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,640
If you still have doubts, I can connect
you directly with their management team.

233
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,560
<i>Welcome back!</i>
<i>Eat With Me is officially returning,</i>

234
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,600
<i>and we've got something exciting for you!</i>

235
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,920
Got a dish you'd love
to see our mystery chef cook?

236
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,800
Drop your menu suggestions in the comments
and use the hashtag EatWithMe!

237
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
The first ten lucky winners will receive

238
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,600
an imported, limited-edition
French wooden cutting board,

239
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,360
personally signed by our chef!

240
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh my gosh. It's so cute!

241
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,760
I want it!

242
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,000
I need to comment now.

243
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,320
What should I say?

244
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,000
Ravioli.

245
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,520
Hey?

246
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,360
Come on. Send already.

247
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,800
There's no signal.

248
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
You want this, don't you?

249
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,200
The French cutting board with
the chef's signature. How did you get it?

250
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,520
I have my ways.

251
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,000
But they just announced it on the page.

252
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,480
Can I have it? Pretty please?

253
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,360
- Please.
- Sure.

254
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,480
Thank you! You're the best!

255
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,880
If you want this,
you need to help me with something first.

256
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,240
Help you with what?

257
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,800
- I want--
- What do you want?

258
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,840
- I want to invite--
- Invite what?

259
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,200
- Invite--
- Invite what?

260
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Invite Nubdao to have lunch with me.

261
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,320
Okay!

262
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Then the cutting board here…

263
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
Will be yours immediately.

264
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,360
Yes, Mr. Kimhan?

265
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,960
<i>Are you home yet, Nubdao?</i>

266
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,640
Almost there.

267
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,720
Tomorrow is your day off, right?

268
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,400
Yes.

269
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,440
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

270
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,360
Why do you want to treat me to a meal?

271
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,600
I want to apologize
for that leaked photo today.

272
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm not available.

273
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
Why not?

274
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,400
On my day off, I have to do laundry
and finish translating documents.

275
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,000
<i>Can't you do them another day?</i>

276
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,320
No.

277
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm home now, Mr. Kim. I have to go.

278
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,840
Nubdao. Nubdao.

279
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,720
- Nubdao.
- Namfah.

280
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,160
You dragged Mr. Pathawee
to drive you home again, didn't you?

281
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,520
That's not it.

282
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,640
It's not that. Really, it's not.

283
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,320
Tomorrow's your day off, right?

284
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm off tomorrow too.
And so is Mr. Pathawee, right?

285
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,720
Yes.

286
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,000
So, that means you're free tomorrow.

287
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,040
- No, I'm not.
- Why not?

288
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,840
I have laundry to do. And ironing.

289
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,040
It's okay. I'll do it for you.

290
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,080
I also have
a lot of translations to finish.

291
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,360
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

292
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,760
Nubdao.

293
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,880
Yes?

294
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,800
The weather here is nice, isn't it?

295
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,160
Yes.

296
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,960
If we go for…

297
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,440
I'd like to invite you to lunch…

298
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,720
with my mom.

299
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,120
Lunch with Ms. Sasi?

300
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,360
Yes.

301
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,400
Nubdao, why did you pinch me?

302
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,880
I told you not to bother
Mr. Pathawee again, didn't I?

303
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,360
I wasn't bothering him.
He wanted to drive me home.

304
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,600
Don't lie to me.

305
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm not lying, really.

306
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,480
Then, do you know why he invited me
to lunch with his mother?

307
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,480
- Nope.
- Are you sure?

308
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,920
I really don't know why
he brought up his mother as an excuse--

309
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,120
I mean, I don't know.

310
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,360
Namfah, get up right now.

311
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,200
Don't pretend to snore.

312
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,720
I don't care what you say.
You're coming with me tomorrow.

313
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,160
I made some
Krathon Loy Kaew for you to try.

314
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,880
Let's go inside.

315
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,400
Here's some Krathon Loy Kaew. Try it.

316
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,400
A little tangy.

317
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,840
Just the right sweetness.

318
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,440
I haven't had this exact taste
in over 20 years.

319
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,159
You should teach me
how to make it, Ratree.

320
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Of course, so you could
make some for Mr. Taychit.

321
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,320
Mother.

322
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,480
Excuse me.

323
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
Alright.

324
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,640
Yes?

325
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,680
Please, Mother.

326
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,080
Come have lunch with me.

327
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,240
Why don't you just go with her alone?

328
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,520
Why do you need me there?

329
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,880
Because I don't have
the courage to go alone. So, I…

330
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,600
Used me as an excuse.

331
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,760
Yes.

332
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,320
It wasn't easy
getting her to agree to this.

333
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,160
I won't.

334
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,200
Mother…

335
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,240
Please come with me? Just this once?

336
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,600
I won't refuse.

337
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,200
Thank you, Mother.

338
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,640
Come on.

339
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,080
Thank you.

340
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,240
Here are some fruits, Madam Jitree.

341
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,280
If Jitsuda were still alive,
she would be doing this too.

342
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,440
Wait.

343
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,800
Yes?

344
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,200
Sasi didn't cause you
any trouble, did she?

345
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,560
No, ma'am.

346
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,360
Maybe she sees that I work for you,
so she doesn't dare.

347
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,680
Good. As long as she knows
whose side you're on.

348
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,040
I don't want you
to serve people like them.

349
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,040
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,760
But Mr. Taychit told me
that if I wanted to stay here,

351
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,600
I had to listen to him alone.

352
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,240
I was the one who brought you in.

353
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,200
You listen to me, not him.

354
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,720
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,720
I trust you.

356
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,320
You won't disappoint me, will you?

357
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,720
No, ma'am.

358
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,280
There they are.

359
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,280
Nubdao.

360
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,600
Good afternoon, Ms. Sasi.

361
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,640
‪Good afternoon.

362
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,080
Please, have a seat.

363
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,480
Such a lovely young lady. Is this the one?

364
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,120
What's your name, dear?

365
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,440
Mom,

366
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,800
this is Namfah, Nubdao's younger sister.

367
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,680
She's just here as company.

368
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,400
Make yourselves comfortable, dears.

369
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

370
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,480
Kim, I have a surprise for you.

371
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm really happy
to have this lunch with you today.

372
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,600
It's an honor for me, Ms. Sasi.

373
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,280
If I knew you knew each other,

374
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,520
I would've invited you
to lunch a long time ago.

375
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,600
Well, it's not too late now.

376
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,520
That's true.

377
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,520
Mr. Pathawee mentioned you had something
you wanted to talk to me about?

378
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,920
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did the other day.

379
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,800
If it weren't for you,

380
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,480
the hotel's reputation
would have been at risk.

381
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,640
I really appreciate it.

382
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,280
Thank you.

383
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,440
Alright, what's your surprise?

384
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,080
Why don't you take a look inside?

385
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,520
Well? Surprise, isn't it?

386
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,280
You have to try this dish.
The "Two-Hearted Sea Bass".

387
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,680
Mr. Wee, my sister doesn't eat spicy food.

388
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,680
Oh, right.

389
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,680
Thank you.

390
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,400
Here, Mom.

391
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,440
Thank you.

392
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,080
They all seem to be having
such a great time together.

393
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,880
Aren't you going to go say hello?

394
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,120
Not necessary.

395
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,600
Bringing Nubdao to meet Ms. Sasi…

396
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,800
That means Mr. Pathawee
must be really serious about her.

397
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,240
Who Nubdao eats with,

398
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,360
or who introduces her to whom,
that's her personal business.

399
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,960
Wow, you're really open-minded, Kim.

400
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,840
It's not about being open-minded.

401
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,640
I just trust Nubdao.

402
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,040
Mother, what do you think of Nubdao?

403
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,240
She's lovely and well-mannered.

404
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,880
So, that means
you won't object if I pursue her?

405
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Of course.

406
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,000
And what if Kim likes her too?

407
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,560
Kimhan likes Nubdao too?

408
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,000
Yes.

409
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,400
If it were anything else,
I might let it go. But not this.

410
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,520
Or…

411
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,840
Are you saying
I should step aside for Kim?

412
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,560
I want you to search your heart carefully.

413
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,840
If you truly like Nubdao,

414
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,600
then fight for her.

415
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,880
I will, Mother.

416
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,120
Nubdao.

417
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,560
How was it?

418
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,520
The food?

419
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,120
Totally worth the reviews.

420
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,000
No, I mean Mr. Wee.

421
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,720
Nothing special. It was just lunch.

422
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,000
Really?

423
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,280
You didn't feel anything at all?

424
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,600
- Oh, I feel something.
- Really?

425
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
What did you feel?

426
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,160
I feel like you like him.

427
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,920
No way! Not at all!

428
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,640
He's not my type at all.

429
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,840
Are you sure?

430
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,320
My heart belongs to the Mystery Chef.

431
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,640
But weren't you the one who kept
saying how perfect Mr. Wee is?

432
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,880
Handsome, cool, and gentle.

433
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,560
When did I ever say that?

434
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,880
He's the perfect man.

435
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,320
He's handsome and such a gentleman.

436
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,960
So cool!

437
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm so sleepy.

438
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,840
My stomach's full. Time for a nap.

439
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,400
Don't try to play dumb with me.

440
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
And don't change the topic.
So, what is it? Mr. Pathawee?

441
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,760
I think I'll go sleep inside.

442
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,840
You can't just run away.

443
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,040
MR. KIMHAN

444
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,840
Yes, Mr. Kim.

445
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,120
How much have you translated today?

446
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,960
Still a lot left to do.

447
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,280
Were you busy with housework?

448
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,800
Yes.

449
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,600
Have you eaten yet?

450
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,240
I have.

451
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,640
Was it good?

452
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,880
It was nice.

453
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,440
That restaurant has a great atmosphere,

454
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,200
<i>and the food's pretty good too,</i>

455
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,720
especially the "Twin-Hearted Seabass".

456
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,160
If you didn't want to eat with me
because you had plans with someone else,

457
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,360
you could've just told me directly.

458
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,720
So good.

459
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,920
I've never thought Taychit would make
his friend's lover his wife.

460
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,480
Sis, it takes two to tango.
The woman must've been into him too.

461
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,920
But it seems like
Ms. Sasi still loves Mr. Aran.

462
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,280
How do you know?

463
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,280
She remembers everything about him.

464
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,280
So?

465
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,440
If I get close to Ms. Sasi,

466
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,360
I might be able to find proof
about Mr. Aran's death.

467
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,800
You think they'd leave evidence
lying around for you to find that easily?

468
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,000
Well, good luck finding it.
Just be careful.

469
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,960
Yeah, thanks.

470
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,040
Oh, by the way, sis.

471
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,920
If you find out
where he keeps his money, just tell me.

472
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,680
Enough.

473
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,760
- I wasn't done eating.
- All you think about is money.

474
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,120
Well, I…

475
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,640
And about eating.

476
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,200
I…

477
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,640
- I'm thinking about you too…
- That's not true.

478
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,560
Finally!

479
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,360
The signed cutting board is mine!

480
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,680
If you can get Nubdao to go
on a one-on-one date with me,

481
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,400
you can ask for anything you want
from Eat With Me.

482
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
Really? Anything at all?

483
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,280
Then I want…

484
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,760
- What do you want?
- I want…

485
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,600
A candlelit dinner with the Mystery Chef.

486
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,840
Deal-- Wait!

487
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,160
- You can't.
- You just said I could ask for anything.

488
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,320
The chef probably
doesn't want to reveal his identity.

489
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,400
But I want to meet him. You get it, right?

490
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,800
I get it.

491
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,600
Then it's settled.
You pick the restaurant.

492
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
Next week, I'll finally meet him.

493
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,960
- Next week?
- Yes.

494
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,960
Welcome to Oriental Paradise.

495
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,440
Would you like a single or double bed?

496
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,680
- A double bed, please.
- Sure.

497
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,000
Alright.

498
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,800
Please fill out this form.

499
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,920
Sure.

500
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,560
Thank you. I'll handle the rest for you.

501
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,680
Your coffee, Mr. Kimhan.

502
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,320
Thank you.

503
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,320
- About yesterday--
- About yesterday--

504
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,560
- Please, you go first.
- You first.

505
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,560
I just wanted to say that

506
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,680
yesterday, I…

507
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,400
You forgot to sign
one more document yesterday.

508
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,360
Here you go.

509
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,440
The meeting is about to start.

510
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,480
Okay.

511
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,000
I'll be back for my coffee.

512
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,560
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.
See you in the afternoon.

513
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,080
Alright. Goodbye.

514
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,640
Everyone's ready for the meeting.

515
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,320
Let me help you.

516
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,760
You should go help Pathawee.

517
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,520
I doubt Mr. Pathawee
wants my help right now.

518
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,080
Let me double-check the guest list.

519
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,960
Of course.

520
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,600
Nubdao.

521
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,640
What time do you finish work today?

522
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,680
Five p.m. Why?

523
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,640
Nothing. I'm heading home first.
See you at home.

524
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,040
I've arranged it. See you this evening.

525
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,520
This evening?

526
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,920
Yes. As soon as she finishes work,
come straight to my house.

527
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,920
- It can be another day.
- Nope. It has to be today.

528
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,200
And don't forget our deal.

529
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,440
Namfah, wait.

530
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,800
Namfah.

531
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,000
Finally, my dream will come true!

532
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,800
Mr. Kimhan.

533
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,800
Are you waiting for me?

534
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,200
Yes. I don't want you to misunderstand
what happened yesterday.

535
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,000
About what?

536
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,960
That I turned down the meal with you
but went with Mr. Pathawee.

537
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,800
So?

538
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,320
Ms. Sasi just wanted to treat me to lunch

539
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,040
as a thank-you for the press conference.
That's all.

540
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,600
That's all, I swear.
I wasn't hiding anything from you.

541
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,640
Why do you want to explain
yourself to me so badly?

542
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,840
How did you know I'd be back?

543
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,720
I saw your car key over there.

544
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,720
I left it there intentionally.

545
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,800
Do you think he'd like
a girl like me, Mr. Wee?

546
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,960
Of course.

547
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,040
<i>You decorated the house so nicely.</i>
<i>Something special happening?</i>

548
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,000
A special someone
is coming over for dinner with Nubdao.

549
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,800
Namfah invited Mr. Pathawee over
for dinner tonight.

550
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,360
Then go ahead and have dinner
with them. I won't intrude.

551
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,360
You'll lead the team

552
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,960
and come up with
a new signature dish within two weeks.

553
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,280
Two weeks?

554
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,360
You won't let me down, will you?

555
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,880
Can I break our contract?

556
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,320
Of course.

557
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,120
Why don't you raise
your children yourself?

558
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,760
I'm not ready.

559
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,640
Don't wait until you are.

560
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,040
By then, you might not
have the chance anymore.

561
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,200
Namfah is one of my employees.
I told you about her before.

562
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,240
- I've met her.
- Excuse me?

563
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,880
Why are you grinning
at your phone like that?

564
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,480
And why are you smiling

565
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,760
at the clock like that?

566
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,480
