1
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,960
In what capacity do you expect me
to return to my children?

2
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,520
I've never even been
a good mother to them.

3
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,400
Namfah, do you have a problem
with Mr. Patthawee?

4
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,760
- No.
- Why didn't you sit in the front seat?

5
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,720
I told you, I'm sleepy.

6
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
Are you mad at me for something?

7
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm not mad.

8
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
"It's been two weeks
since we became a couple.

9
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,640
Let's go on a date tonight."

10
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,840
<i>Talking to Nubdao?</i>

11
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,480
I'm taking her out for dinner tonight.

12
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,840
<i>That's romantic. Enjoy your dinner.</i>

13
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,840
This is my first relationship,

14
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,080
so I didn't know
which dates I had to remember.

15
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,080
<i>After she finished eating,</i>
<i>she fell asleep,</i>

16
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,680
<i>so I went to use the restroom.</i>

17
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
<i>When I came out, she was gone.</i>

18
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,440
<i>Namfah told me</i>

19
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
<i>your friend is really sick?</i>

20
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,520
What happened to your friend?

21
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,880
She was abused by her stepfather.

22
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,640
You said you came home to get something.

23
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Did you get it already?

24
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,880
Yes, I got it.

25
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,720
<i>Do I know the friend</i>
<i>you've been taking care of?</i>

26
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,839
No, you don't.

27
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,640
I guess I've never met this friend either.

28
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,760
Never.

29
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,840
Then it's not Ms. Yada?

30
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,600
NURSE

31
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,200
Pick it up.
She might have gone missing again.

32
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,200
Yes?

33
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,640
Do you really believe your friend is sick?

34
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,360
Yeah, why?

35
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,280
Check the video I just sent you.

36
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
<i>I've seen that nurse before.</i>

37
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,040
Right outside your friend's condo unit.

38
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,200
Your friend hired a private nurse?

39
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,640
<i>Yada is staying there, isn't she?</i>

40
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,880
As soon as I said I was going to visit,

41
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,680
she rushed back home.

42
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
Whose house is this?

43
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
Which one do you think is Yada's house?

44
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
That one.

45
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,680
But on Yada's job application,
the address is this house.

46
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,600
YADA PHAKAMAS

47
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,160
That's my mother…

48
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
and her new husband.

49
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Don't go.

50
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,280
Are you just going to let him
hurt your mother like that?

51
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,600
If you interfere,

52
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,960
it'll only make things worse.

53
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,440
Let go!

54
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,280
Let go of me!

55
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
Don't go!

56
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
Don't leave me!

57
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
You're annoying!

58
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,800
- You're--
- Please stop!

59
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,960
This is between a husband and wife.
Who the hell are you?

60
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,680
Your wife is the mother of my friend.

61
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,160
You can't hurt her like this.

62
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,560
Did you have an affair?

63
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,320
You've got a kid? Since when?

64
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
Tell me the truth!

65
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,680
I never had an affair.
I never had a child.

66
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,120
I swear.

67
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,720
Then why is this bastard
running his mouth?

68
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Yada is your daughter.

69
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,000
Yada who?

70
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,240
I don't know her.

71
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,600
The woman living in that house next door.

72
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,480
That woman? She lives alone.

73
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,840
She doesn't have any parents.

74
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm not her mother.

75
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,360
So, you're saying
you're not actually Yada's mother?

76
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,680
Of course not!

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
Please… don't leave me

78
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,520
Nubdao.

79
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,560
Why are you sitting out here?
You'll get sick again.

80
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,120
Is something wrong?

81
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,600
I guess

82
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,280
Mr. Kim doesn't trust me anymore.

83
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,720
Why do you think that?

84
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,600
I gave him a chance
to tell me the truth today,

85
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,960
but he still chose to lie.

86
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,520
About Ms. Yada?

87
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,600
So, you think…

88
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,920
the reason he didn't tell you the truth…

89
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
Because I was never worth trusting.

90
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,120
Don't blame yourself, Nubdao.

91
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,720
Come in.

92
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,560
How are you feeling? Any better?

93
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
A little better now.

94
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,200
You should be able to go back to work.

95
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,320
Are you sure you're up for it?

96
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,480
Even if I'm not, I have no choice.
My leave is over.

97
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
Did you call your mom?

98
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,280
I just got off the phone with her.

99
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,280
How is she?

100
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,640
Is she still being abused?

101
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,360
Same as always.

102
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,880
It won't be the same anymore, Yada.

103
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,240
What do you mean?

104
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,440
What's this?

105
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,920
A key to a rental house.

106
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,200
A gift for you and your mom.

107
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Why? Are you afraid Nubdao will find out?

108
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,080
But my mom won't come with me.

109
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,040
I called her today, but she refused.

110
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,520
- Want me to talk to her for you?
- No, it's okay.

111
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,840
Why not?

112
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,080
You said if you had a choice, you'd take
your mom away from that hellhole.

113
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,480
Or have you changed your mind?

114
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,240
No.

115
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
I'll try talking to her again.

116
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
Let me know when you're ready.

117
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
- I'll take you there.
- That's not necessary.

118
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,880
I don't want to see you
get hurt by your stepfather again.

119
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,960
It's painful.

120
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
You know that, right?

121
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,360
Yada.

122
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,440
Thank you…

123
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,640
for opening my eyes.

124
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,360
No problem.

125
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,160
I didn't want you and Nubdao to have
a misunderstanding because of Yada.

126
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,880
What should I do now?

127
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,120
Right now, you need to explain
everything to Nubdao first.

128
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,280
As for Yada…

129
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Do you think

130
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm as warm

131
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,240
as the summer sun?

132
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,760
<i>I think you're more like the evening sun.</i>

133
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,000
<i>The sun that's about to set…</i>

134
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,720
Doesn't that seem…

135
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,840
a bit lonely and sad?

136
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,280
But I see it as the last warm light

137
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,760
that embraces the little stars at night.

138
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
When the sun sets,

139
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,320
it's time for the stars to shine,

140
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,160
isn't it?

141
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,520
<i>All of my time…</i>

142
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,240
<i>belongs to you alone.</i>

143
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,640
Whether in happiness or sorrow,

144
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,520
the sunlight will always be near you,

145
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
giving you hope,

146
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,760
strength,

147
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,400
and warmth.

148
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
<i>Always.</i>

149
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,200
I admit…

150
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,480
it was all my fault,

151
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
Nubdao.

152
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,080
I'm returning all the time you gave me.

153
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,800
Don't waste it
on someone unworthy like me.

154
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,040
Have some water, Mr. Kim.

155
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,920
I'll leave it here for you.

156
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
Mr. Kim must truly regret what he's done.

157
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,920
Nubdao.

158
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Why don't you hear him out?

159
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,440
Maybe he has a reason.

160
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,360
Hello, Mr. Patthawee.

161
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,560
You're coming to work today, right?

162
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Yes, I am.

163
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,080
I'll pick you up from your house then.
It's on my way.

164
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
Oh, no need. I'll get there myself.

165
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,240
See you in an hour.

166
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,080
Yes, Mr. Patthawee?

167
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,640
There's heavy traffic. I might not
make it in time to pick you up.

168
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,760
Oh, that's fine.

169
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,800
Alright.

170
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
<i>You can't hurt her like this.</i>

171
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,760
<i>Did you have an affair?</i>
<i>You have a child? Since when?</i>

172
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,400
<i>I never…</i>

173
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,720
<i>I never had an affair.</i>

174
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Come watch this with me.

175
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,240
<i>I swear.</i>

176
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,520
<i>Then why is this bastard</i>
<i>running his mouth?</i>

177
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,520
<i>Tell me!</i>

178
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,560
<i>I don't have a child!</i>

179
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,080
<i>Yada is your daughter.</i>

180
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
<i>Yada who?</i>

181
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,240
<i>I don't know her.</i>

182
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,120
<i>The woman living in that house next door.</i>

183
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,400
<i>That woman? She lives alone.</i>

184
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,680
<i>She doesn't have any parents.</i>

185
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,840
I don't see anything interesting here.

186
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,560
Why did you do this to me?

187
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,160
Do you believe me now, Kim?

188
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,520
No one understands you better than I do.

189
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,560
Yes, Mom?

190
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,160
What else should I do?

191
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,160
Just a little tired, but hearing
your voice makes it better.

192
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,680
What happened to you?

193
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,760
Kim, I'm scared…

194
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,880
Kim…

195
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,240
Help me…

196
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,280
No woman…

197
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,000
deserves to be treated like this.

198
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,280
You knew I couldn't stand it,
so you made everything up to fool me?

199
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,080
You're crazy.

200
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,320
Yes, I am.

201
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,400
Because I love you.

202
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,360
Can't we go back to the way we were, Kim?

203
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,720
Hey…

204
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,080
- Hey…
- Please stop,

205
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
Ms. Yada.

206
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,840
You're the one who should stop.

207
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,320
Yada!

208
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,680
You should never use someone's weakness

209
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,360
against them for your own amusement.

210
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,240
Kim…

211
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,200
I'm sorry.

212
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
I only did it

213
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,960
because I wanted you to care about me.

214
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,920
To feel for me.

215
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,080
To love me like before.

216
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,840
Let me go.

217
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
I hope

218
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,760
you finally learn
how to let go of your past.

219
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,440
Thank you…

220
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,760
for coming with me today.

221
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,680
Love, for me,

222
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,840
is trust.

223
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,320
If we don't trust each other,
how can we move forward?

224
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,560
It's not that I didn't trust you.

225
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,920
I just wanted to protect
a woman's dignity, that's all.

226
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,200
I thought Yada was being abused,
just like my mother was.

227
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,880
I was too young back then.

228
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,680
I couldn't help my mother at all.

229
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,720
I just didn't want any woman
to suffer the same way she did.

230
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,840
But I never thought

231
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,640
Yada would use my past against me.

232
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,440
I was a fool.

233
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,840
A fool who clung to the past so much

234
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,440
that I almost lost you.

235
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,400
If I were you,

236
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,080
I would have done the same thing.

237
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Does it hurt?

238
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,480
Namfah,

239
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,960
what time do you get off work?

240
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,720
Three in the afternoon.

241
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,520
That's when I finish too.
Do you want to go home together?

242
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
I have to go…

243
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
Where? I'll take you.

244
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,520
I need to buy offerings.

245
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,720
Offerings?

246
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,920
It's my birthday.

247
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,560
Namfah's birthday?

248
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,520
ARAN JIRACHAWALAI

249
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Ratree…

250
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,480
It's been 24 years,

251
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,480
and I still believe Mr. Aran was murdered.

252
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,080
And you, Ms. Sasi?

253
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,320
ARAN JIRACHAWALAI - BORN: MARCH 10, 1957
DIED: DECEMBER 25, 1996

254
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,600
At first, I thought the same thing.

255
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,840
But after finding Aran's life will,

256
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,840
I believed he had taken his own life.

257
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,840
Yet, in my heart, I was always confused.

258
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,440
Because Aran always told me
he would marry me.

259
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,400
So, why did he leave me…

260
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,400
And your child,

261
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,080
right?

262
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,280
Mr. Aran, what are you doing?

263
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,320
My wife has morning sickness.

264
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,560
She's been craving santol in syrup.

265
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,920
Congratulations!

266
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,400
Do you want a boy or a girl?

267
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,520
A boy.

268
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
Do you have any proof
that Aran was murdered?

269
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,520
Mr. Aran left me this.

270
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,280
It's all I have.
I don't have any other evidence.

271
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,000
Do you recognize these numbers?

272
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,040
Your birthday is in two days.

273
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,640
Why buy everything so early?

274
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,040
I'm working a double shift tomorrow.

275
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,520
I won't have time.

276
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,120
And… can I join you
for your birthday merit-making?

277
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,800
Of course! The more, the better.

278
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,320
I'll ask Nubdao to invite Mr. Kimhan too.
Wouldn't that be nice?

279
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,280
That sounds perfect.

280
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,400
It was so close, Father.

281
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
So close to what?

282
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,440
To losing my heart.

283
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,880
Mr. Wee,

284
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,880
could you go ahead first?

285
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,920
I need to buy something.

286
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,560
What is it? I'll get it for you.

287
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,520
Um… It's a…

288
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,000
A personal item for women.

289
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,520
This is Namfah's cutting board.

290
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
Why was it under her pillow?

291
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,560
It's from the Mystery Chef.

292
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,440
Who's that?

293
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,360
He's Namfah's idol.

294
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,680
See? He even signed it here.

295
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,560
She's only seen his hands,
and she's obsessed with him.

296
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,560
So, she's never seen his face?

297
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,600
She did try to meet him once,
but before she could see his face,

298
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,840
she fainted.

299
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,480
What's his name?

300
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,880
Three-three-M?

301
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,840
What kind of signature is this?

302
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,440
Patthawee?!

303
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,400
Yes?

304
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,760
No way, right?

305
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,440
No…

306
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes…

307
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,200
Can you two not tell Namfah just yet?

308
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,600
Why not?

309
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,920
I want to tell her myself on her birthday.

310
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,400
You're sure you'll tell her, right?

311
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,800
Yes, I will.

312
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,840
It's going to be
the best birthday gift for her.

313
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,520
But if Dad finds out, you know

314
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,320
what's going to happen, right?

315
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,200
I'll only tell Namfah.

316
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,360
9-3-2-1-4-2…

317
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,920
It's not a safe code,

318
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,080
not a house number,

319
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,960
not an ID number.

320
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,080
It's nothing I recognize.

321
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
I can't figure it out, Ratree.

322
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,120
It's okay. Take your time.

323
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,520
I just can't make sense of it.

324
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,680
Ms. Sasi,

325
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,080
did Mr. Aran ever leave notes

326
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,560
or letters for you?

327
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,080
He never liked writing to me.

328
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,440
But he used to record tapes for me.

329
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,280
Today is the first day
I'm recording for you.

330
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,040
From now on, I'll keep recording
everything I feel for you here.

331
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,800
It's been over 20 years.
Those tapes probably don't work anymore.

332
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,760
They do. I converted
all the recordings to digital files.

333
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,080
What did Mr. Aran record on them?

334
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,440
Mostly songs.

335
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,240
But on special occasions,
he left messages for me.

336
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,320
But I never dared

337
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,000
to listen to the last tape.

338
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,800
Why not?

339
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,360
I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

340
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,840
Who's back so early?

341
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,680
You're home, sweetheart.

342
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,080
- Yes, Mom.
- Have you eaten?

343
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,360
I have.

344
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,240
Mom…

345
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,680
I want you to ask yourself honestly.

346
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,960
If you truly like Nubdao,

347
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,360
you have to fight for your own heart.

348
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,880
I think I know my own heart now, Mom.

349
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,760
Do I know her?

350
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,600
Yes.

351
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,640
But I'm not sure…
if she finds out something about me,

352
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,000
how she will feel about it.

353
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,440
And what secret are you keeping from her?

354
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,320
Secrets are heavy, son.

355
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,400
The longer you keep them,

356
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,920
the more they weigh you down.

357
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,280
I believe

358
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,040
Namfah will listen to your reasons.

359
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,640
Yes, Mom.

360
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,720
Who's back so early?

361
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,920
You should go now, Ratree.

362
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,880
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,480
Are you looking for this?

364
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,440
Yes.

365
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,040
Here.

366
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,200
- Thank you.
- No problem.

367
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,760
<i>Today is the first day</i>
<i>I'm recording for you.</i>

368
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,560
<i>From now on, I'll keep recording</i>
<i>everything I feel for you here.</i>

369
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,920
This folder…

370
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,480
I never dared to listen to it.

371
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,040
But today…

372
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,320
I'm ready, Aran.

373
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,520
4 p.m.?

374
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,320
How long have you been here?

375
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,600
I'm sorry.

376
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,040
I was tidying up upstairs
and didn't hear you come in.

377
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,720
It's fine. I just got home too.

378
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,200
You must be tired.
I'll go make you a cold drink.

379
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,760
Only one lucky winner

380
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,600
will get to meet

381
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,160
the Mystery Chef.

382
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,600
Send in your names.

383
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,680

NAMFAH PATEEPKAMOL

388
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,240
Are you sure you don't want
to come to the party with me?

389
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,560
Yes.

390
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,200
You know I don't enjoy social events.

391
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,280
Alright then.

392
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,920
After work,
I'll head straight to the party.

393
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,880
Alright.

394
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,880
Yeah?

395
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,000
I'm heading out now.

396
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,720
2-4-2-1-3-9…

397
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,320
3-9?

398
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,160
4-2-1-2-9…

399
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,840
2-1-1-2-3-9.

400
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,320
I found it, Ratree.
The numbers Aran gave you.

401
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,760
It's this folder, 241239.

402
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,320
It's the one I haven't listened to yet.

403
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,800
Try reading the numbers backward.

404
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,360
9-3-2-1-4-2…

405
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,200
Yes.

406
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,400
What did Mr. Aran record in this folder?

407
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,120
I haven't listened to it yet.

408
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,680
NO FILE

409
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,480
Where did the file go?

410
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,720
It was here yesterday.

411
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,800
Mr. Wee!

412
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,840
Mr. Wee!

413
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,040
I won! I got selected
to meet the Mystery Chef!

414
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,480
Congratulations, Namfah.
Where and when do you have to meet him?

415
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,840
Tomorrow at the studio.
They'll send me the location later.

416
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,360
Alright.

417
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,440
Here, this is for you.

418
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,920
Thank you.

419
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,160
Sasi.

420
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,920
<i>There must be</i>
<i>some kind of clue hidden in the file.</i>

421
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,800
<i>Are you sure it's really him?</i>

422
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,760
Who else could it be?

423
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,960
Did you forget what day tomorrow is?

424
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,320
- What day?
- It's Namfah's birthday.

425
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,800
It's almost time for the meeting.
What if he doesn't show up?

426
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,760
<i>I think this will be</i>
<i>a really special birthday present</i>

427
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,520
for you this year.

428
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,120
I want him to flirt with me.

429
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,400
Like, actually flirt with me, Nubdao!

430
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,400
Flamingo flower?

431
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,080
If I'm going to give her something,
it has to be memorable.

432
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,920
- Whose picture is this?
- Do you know anyone in this picture?

433
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,080
No, I don't know any of them.

434
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,120
Are you sure?

435
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,040
Yeah, I'm sure.

436
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,160
Then I'll ask Aunt Ratree myself.

437
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,440
Your mother is still alive.

438
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
