1
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
I know you're confused right now.

2
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,720
You don't have to make a decision yet.

3
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
<i>I know</i>

4
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,200
<i>you've been watching over us all along.</i>

5
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm sorry

6
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
that I wasn't there for you
when you were suffering.

7
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,080
I don't have much to give you,

8
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,200
but these were my daughter's clothes.

9
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,960
<i>Why wear a dead woman's clothes?</i>

10
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,800
You remember? I thought you had forgotten.

11
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,760
This woman's wearing Jitsuda's clothes.

12
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
She wants to haunt me!

13
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,880
Your next job is to find out

14
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,640
why Ratree seems so close to my wife.

15
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,560
Mirantee?

16
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,320
Are you nervous about the questions?

17
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,040
You'll do great.

18
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,720
Would you take a break and eat first?

19
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,840
My mom made extra food for you too.

20
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,840
- Let me help.
- Okay.

21
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Aunt Ratree's cooking is as good as ever.

22
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,480
You talk as if you've tried
my mom's cooking before.

23
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440
Well,

24
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,560
Aunt Ratree applied to be
a kitchen helper alongside Namfah.

25
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
Her cooking must be great.

26
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,160
By the way…

27
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,280
Does Aunt Ratree have a favorite dish?

28
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,200
Probably Baabin. She finished
an entire box alone the other day.

29
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,720
Perfect. I know the best place for that.

30
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
Trying to earn brownie points?

31
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
Just a little.

32
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,840
Not just a little, I guess.

33
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,640
You're right.

34
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Do I really have to interview you?

35
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Don't smile at me. I'm not as nice as Kim.

36
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,520
But Talay said you're kind and very cute.

37
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,000
He said that?

38
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
Yes.

39
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,760
Can we start now?

40
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
How do you feel if you have a windfall

41
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,840
and get to inherit
a leadership position at the hotel?

42
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,200
Do you want an answer
from the vice president or from Patthawee?

43
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,080
What's the difference?

44
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,680
As the vice president,

45
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,360
I feel honored to have this opportunity.

46
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,960
It's a challenging role.

47
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,760
The hotel business constantly evolves,

48
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
but I believe that my team and I,
who's been with us a long time,

49
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,440
are fully capable
of adapting and growing together.

50
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,960
And as Patthawee?

51
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,640
To me, this position is more
of a responsibility than a dream.

52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
How?

53
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,640
Because I have to leave my dream behind.

54
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,560
That means
you don't actually want to do it?

55
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,640
That's not it. I'm willing to do it
because I don't want to disappoint my dad.

56
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,160
What a grateful son.

57
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,240
So, what makes
the food department you oversee special?

58
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,200
I believe food can bring people together.

59
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,320
Food is that important?

60
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,680
Yes, for me, it is.

61
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,680
If I had the chance to sit
at a table with my father,

62
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,400
my mother, my brother, and my sister,

63
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,560
I'd be really happy.

64
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,160
- Where are you going?
- I'm thirsty.

65
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,480
I don't like apple juice.

66
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,040
But you have the maid
make it for you every day.

67
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,280
Don't act like you know me.

68
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,120
Sit down. I'm continuing
the interview. Pay attention.

69
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,920
Alright.

70
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,800
If you had to recommend
a signature dish for the hotel,

71
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,440
what would it be?

72
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Four-flavor pizza.

73
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,120
What inspired this menu?

74
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,559
Family.

75
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,000
My father loves strong flavors,

76
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,720
so I made a Diavola pizza for him.

77
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Aside from mozzarella cheese,

78
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,840
I also added spicy mozzarella

79
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
and tomatoes to balance the richness.

80
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
The second pizza is for my mother.

81
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
She doesn't like meat much,

82
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
so I made a Margherita pizza,

83
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,200
using only tomato sauce,

84
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,880
mozzarella, and Italian basil.

85
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,560
The third pizza

86
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
is for Kim.

87
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,280
I know he loves seafood,

88
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,320
so I used tiger prawns,
squid, and mussels.

89
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,840
The base is similar to a seafood stew,

90
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,560
made with tomato sauce and cheese.

91
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,320
It's not too cheesy,

92
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
rich in flavor, just the way he likes it.

93
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,080
And the last one must be for…

94
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,320
My sister.

95
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,480
Do you even know
what kind of pizza I like?

96
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,520
Tartufina.

97
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,560
I used mozzarella, mascarpone,

98
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,920
porcini mushrooms,
and truffle, exactly what you like.

99
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,600
Then, I drizzled truffle oil over it
to make it a white pizza.

100
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
Because I know my little sister
doesn't like tomatoes. Am I right?

101
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,600
It's freaking good!

102
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,840
Come on. Eat up, Tawan.

103
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,200
You like that basil pizza, don't you?

104
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,960
Kim! I like truffle!

105
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,040
Oh, really?

106
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
Then, hurry up and eat.
Wee made it just for you.

107
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,360
Are you going to eat it?

108
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,600
if you're not, I'll just have it myself.

109
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
So?

110
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,120
It's fine.

111
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,080
Looks like you'll have to cook
for my sister more often, Wee.

112
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,640
Sure.

113
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,360
This is so soft and melts in my mouth!

114
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,040
The crust is thin and just perfect.
This is amazing, Mr. Wee.

115
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Glad you like it too.

116
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,120
Like it too?

117
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,640
Like who?

118
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,760
Promtawan. She had some earlier.

119
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
Happy now?

120
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,720
I have to thank Kim for helping out.

121
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,040
Give her some time.

122
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,960
Yeah.

123
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,040
What are you doing here?

124
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,000
Mirantee.

125
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,160
I came to apologize…

126
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,240
for everything I did to you.

127
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,640
- <i>Come with us.</i>
- <i>I didn't do anything wrong.</i>

128
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,680
Sir, here is the evidence.

129
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
NSB

130
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,240
What did I ever do to you

131
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,040
to deserve this?

132
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
You never did anything to me…

133
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,560
and we never had any conflict.

134
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,800
But I did everything I did

135
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,200
because I had no choice.

136
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,400
No choice?

137
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,040
And you chose to ruin my life?

138
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,560
I was thrown in jail
for a crime I didn't commit!

139
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,240
My family was destroyed, my children
were left without a mother because of you!

140
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,360
And now you're saying sorry?

141
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,400
Sorry? That's it?

142
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,920
This is all I can do.

143
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,520
My life hasn't been any better.

144
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,440
I'm not living a happy life either.

145
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,120
Every day feels like a prison.

146
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
I can't even have a family

147
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,400
because I'm afraid
they'll end up suffering.

148
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
SIR

149
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,280
Yes, sir.

150
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
<i>What's the update on Ratree?</i>

151
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,880
I haven't found anything yet.

152
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,880
What? This is a simple task.
What's taking you so long?

153
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,400
<i>Or are you worried about your mother?</i>

154
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,880
<i>Should I send someone to pick her up</i>
<i>and take care of her for you?</i>

155
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
No, sir.

156
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Why not? I'd treat her well.

157
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,480
Give me a little more time, sir.

158
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,200
Then hurry up before your mother
runs out of time waiting for you.

159
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,359
Yes, sir.

160
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,599
Mr. Taychit

161
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
is suspicious about
why you were close to his wife.

162
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,080
So, he sent you to find out?

163
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,200
How far do I have to run
to finally escape all of you?

164
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,800
You don't have to run anymore.

165
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,040
I won't tell him you're here.

166
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,960
How can I trust you?

167
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,320
I promise…

168
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,640
Mr. Taychit will never know
that Mirantee is still alive.

169
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,560
And I will never return
to trouble you again.

170
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,600
Are you sure?

171
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,040
I want to get away from him too.

172
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,680
I want to stop living like this.

173
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
But I can't do that yet.

174
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,720
Then why don't you just tell the truth?

175
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,520
Send him to jail and clear my name!

176
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
Wait.

177
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
What happened to Mr. Aran?

178
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry, Mirantee.

179
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,040
Who is Mirantee?

180
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,760
You're better off not knowing.

181
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,880
If you want to know the truth,

182
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,080
why don't you just ask your father?

183
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,760
<i>You don't have to run anymore.</i>
<i>I won't tell him you're here.</i>

184
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
- <i>How can I trust you?</i>
- <i>I promise…</i>

185
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,320
<i>Mr. Taychit will never know</i>
<i>that Mirantee is still alive.</i>

186
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,880
<i>And I will never return</i>
<i>to trouble you again.</i>

187
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
- Pu.
- Hmm?

188
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,960
I want to bring my kids
to live with me. What do you think?

189
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,720
That's great!

190
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,560
I bet the kids want to be
with their mother too!

191
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,320
- What about me?
- You should come live with us too.

192
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,240
Of course!

193
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,640
I'll give the big room to my daughters.
I'll move into the smaller room.

194
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
- As for you--
- I'll stay with you.

195
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,560
You'll stay downstairs!
My room is too small!

196
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
I don't care where I stay,

197
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,280
as long as we're all together.

198
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,640
You're happy, the kids are happy,
and that means I'm happy too.

199
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,240
<i>Wait. What happened to Mr. Aran?</i>

200
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,720
<i>I'm sorry, Mirantee.</i>

201
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,800
You're home early today, Kim.

202
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,600
Kim, is something wrong?

203
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,560
- Wee.
- Yes?

204
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,560
Has your mother
ever mentioned someone named Mirantee?

205
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,320
Mirantee?

206
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,920
No.

207
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,800
Why?

208
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,040
Today, I ran into Yos, one of Dad's men.

209
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,320
He mentioned someone named Mirantee,

210
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,200
so I wanted to ask.

211
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,440
Miran…

212
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,920
- Sir.
- Yes?

213
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,160
I looked into Ratree.
There's nothing suspicious.

214
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,840
She already moved upcountry.
She found a new job there.

215
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,280
Good. At least she won't be
snooping around my wife anymore.

216
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,000
If I have another job for you,
I'll let you know.

217
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,760
Yes, sir.

218
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,600
Mom.

219
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,040
Yos.

220
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
How did you get here?

221
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,680
Why didn't you call?

222
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,640
It's so hard to reach you.

223
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,800
I never know if you're even alive or dead.

224
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,080
Don't worry about me, Mom.

225
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
I'm not going to die that easily.

226
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,520
You're my son. How can I not worry?

227
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,800
Come here. Let me hug you.

228
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,320
Mom.

229
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,120
I'll leave something here.

230
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,160
This is something
very important to my life.

231
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
Please keep it safe for me.
Don't let anyone take it.

232
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,680
Where are you going now?

233
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm not going anywhere anymore.

234
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
By the way,

235
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,280
I was thinking about moving you
somewhere else. Let's go together.

236
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,840
You're not working for him anymore?

237
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,400
No, Mom. He let me take care of you now.

238
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Really?

239
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,280
Now that we're about to leave,
I feel a little sad.

240
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,360
Yeah…

241
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,320
We've been in this house
for such a long time.

242
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,480
Very long…

243
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,040
Thank you, little home.

244
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,760
It may be small…

245
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,480
but it was always warm.
We slept well every night.

246
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,720
Tonight…

247
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,360
will be our last night here, right?

248
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Yeah, the last night.

249
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,960
Namfah.

250
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,320
Do you remember that spot?

251
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,320
<i>That's where we used to fold paper bags</i>
<i>and compete with each other.</i>

252
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,520
<i>And Uncle Pu would make us omelet rice.</i>

253
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,000
I remember it.

254
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,200
I remember too.

255
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,640
How come you remember before me?

256
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,120
I was the one cooking.

257
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,560
Thank you, Uncle Pu, for raising us.

258
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,800
What's with you now?

259
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,760
What's wrong with you?

260
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,360
Even though you raised us
in a buffet-style way,

261
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,600
we were so, so happy!

262
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,240
We love you, Uncle Pu.

263
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,280
I love you two so much too,
my little nieces.

264
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,840
Then, tonight…

265
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,840
can we sleep in your room?

266
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
My room is tiny!

267
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,120
But it's our last night here together!

268
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,720
Exactly! That's the spirit!

269
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
My little nieces.

270
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,800
So heavy! Too much for this tiny house.
I told you to throw some away!

271
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,680
This book is huge!
I'm throwing everything away!

272
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,080
Hey, hey! Those belong to the kids.

273
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,560
- What are you complaining about so much?
- It's heavy.

274
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,280
I'll deal with it later.

275
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,080
Hello, Ms. Sasi?

276
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,040
Ratree, are you free today?

277
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
You must be exhausted lately.

278
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,880
So many guests staying at the hotel
and the 30th-anniversary book project.

279
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,440
But it's only your first year here,
and my girlfriend is already

280
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,760
the model for the hotel's book.

281
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,640
Hey, Nubdao, let me ask you something.

282
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
When you were investigating Mr. Aran,

283
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,840
did you ever come across
the name Mirantee?

284
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,760
Ms. Sanguansri once mentioned

285
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,640
that she used to be a chef at our hotel.

286
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,080
She worked here?

287
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,480
Yes, but I heard
she got arrested on drug charges.

288
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,160
The scandal hurt the hotel's reputation.

289
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,880
I remember seeing a photo
of Ms. Mirantee with Mr. Aran

290
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,240
in the hotel's 10th-anniversary book.

291
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,240
Do we still have that book?

292
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,520
I'm sorry, Ms. Sasi,

293
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,400
for leaving the other day
without properly saying goodbye.

294
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,880
It's okay. I understand.

295
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Thank you.

296
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,800
- Ratree.
- Yes?

297
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,360
Do you happen to know
someone named Mirantee?

298
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,120
I used to hear

299
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Aran mentioned that name a lot,
but I never actually met her.

300
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,200
I want to find her.

301
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,120
Maybe she knows
something about Aran's death.

302
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,040
I don't think

303
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,560
she knows anything.

304
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,640
Why do you say that?

305
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,880
Not long after Mr. Aran passed away,

306
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,640
Mirantee was arrested

307
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,320
on drug charges.

308
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,320
Did she have a family?

309
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,760
Yes, she did.

310
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,600
How are they doing now?

311
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,320
Broken.

312
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,480
Destroyed.

313
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,720
She was ripped away from her children
when they were still so young.

314
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,080
She couldn't attend her husband's funeral.

315
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,600
Her children lost
both their father and mother

316
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,720
and had to struggle through life alone.

317
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,880
But she finally got out of prison

318
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,640
and got to see her children again.

319
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,680
She longed to embrace them,
even just once.

320
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,160
I couldn't even do that.

321
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Ratree…

322
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,240
Mirantee?

323
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,640
Yes.

324
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,960
I am Mirantee.

325
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,360
Uncle Pu.

326
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,640
Have you seen a book
with the hotel's picture on the cover?

327
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,880
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

328
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,480
Right here.

329
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,720
- Here.
- You sold it?

330
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,880
Of course. I didn't even get much money.
And I'm not splitting it with you.

331
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,800
Are you home?

332
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,080
Yes. Mr. Kim, about the book…

333
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,199
- Did you find it?
- <i>Uncle Pu already sold it.</i>

334
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,760
I'm sorry.

335
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,639
It's alright. Thank you.

336
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,639
Sasi.

337
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,159
Where have you been?

338
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
I went to meet a friend.

339
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,639
A friend? Do I know them?

340
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,440
A friend from high school
just got back from overseas.

341
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,360
Next time, if you're going out,

342
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,040
let me know. I'll take you myself.

343
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,960
I feel sticky from the heat.
I'll go take a shower first.

344
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,080
Yos? Mr. Taychit's right-hand man?

345
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,240
Yes.

346
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,800
Even after I was released from prison,

347
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,640
he kept trying to kill me.

348
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,080
So, you went to work in my house because…

349
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,280
I needed evidence.

350
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,640
I wanted to go back to my children
as an innocent person.

351
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,160
But I never found anything.

352
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,240
Do you think…

353
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,600
Mr. Taychit knew about all of this?

354
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,800
Yes.

355
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,720
But you don't have to believe me.

356
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,440
- Let me help you, Namfah.
- No, you can't.

357
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,120
- Then, I'll just do it myself.
- You can't!

358
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,480
Then, let's do it together.

359
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,080
Watch out, Mr. Wee!

360
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,640
If you want to know the truth,

361
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,080
why don't you just ask your father?

362
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Mr. Kim, do you need something?

363
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,560
Do you…

364
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,920
happen to know Mirantee?
She was a friend of Mr. Aran's.

365
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,840
No, I don't.

366
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,000
I see. Never mind, then.

367
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,600
Are you suspecting something

368
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,760
about your father?

369
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,920
I am too.

370
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,800
And I also know
who you should ask for answers.

371
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,160
Who?

372
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,000
Yos.

373
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,520
How do I find him?

374
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,360
I'll take care of that for you.

375
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,240
Mr. Kim! You're early.

376
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,960
I haven't even showered yet.

377
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,840
Then, go ahead and get ready.

378
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,880
I'll help you pack.

379
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,160
But…

380
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,120
Alright. Wait for me.

381
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,840
NUBDAO'S BOOKS

382
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,000
"Keep fighting, Mirantee."

383
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,120
KEEP FIGHTING, MIRANTEE.

384
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,680
"I hope you can become
a Michelin-starred chef.

385
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,960
Keep fighting. From Aran."

386
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,400
KEEP FIGHTING, MIRANTEE.

387
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,760
Here's your coffee.

388
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,200
Ms. Mirantee…

389
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,360
is you, Aunt Ratree?

390
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,440
I deliberately stepped
in front of your car that day.

391
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,880
Why?

392
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,920
I needed to get into your house

393
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
to look for evidence
regarding Mr. Aran's death.

394
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,240
Do you believe

395
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,600
my father was involved
in Mr. Aran's death?

396
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,240
Yes.

397
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,800
Do you know what they were fighting about?

398
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
I think it was about money.

399
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,760
Back then, the hotel
was struggling financially

400
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,160
because of the Tom Yum Kung crisis.

401
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,800
Your special menu for next month

402
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,440
has been approved.

403
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,760
Really?

404
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,160
But you'll have to cook it
for me and Taychit first.

405
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,760
Of course. I'll do my best.

406
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,800
As for this month's budget,

407
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,760
the accounting department has reviewed it,
and I've signed off on it already.

408
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,680
Thank you.

409
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,400
Aran!

410
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,520
Aran! Why didn't you approve
my budget request?

411
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
The whole industry

412
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,960
is struggling. If we don't renovate now,

413
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,520
how are we supposed
to keep up with competitors?

414
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,360
Stop it, Taychit.

415
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,400
Stop what?

416
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,200
Stop what you're doing

417
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,440
before it all comes to light.

418
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,720
I don't want to lose a friend over this.

419
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,480
I'm warning you because I care.

420
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,120
Then, let me warn you as well.

421
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,960
Stay out of my business!

422
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,880
After that…

423
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,080
I don't even know
how everything got tangled up with me

424
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,000
that I had to end up behind bars.

425
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,800
The day I was arrested,

426
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,320
I saw Yos,

427
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,160
your father's man,

428
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,880
standing right outside my house.

429
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,600
Do you have any proof, Kim?

430
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,640
Not yet.

431
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,440
I think Yos might have acted on his own,
and Dad had no idea.

432
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,880
I'd like to believe that too,

433
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,800
but only Yos can answer that question.

434
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,520
That's why Ms. Sasi

435
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,160
is trying to help me contact him.

436
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,520
Mother knows about this too?

437
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,560
Not his own birthday…

438
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,680
Could it be mine?

439
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,240
Your mom just sent me his number.

440
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,760
INCOMING CALL

441
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,240
Why don't you pick up?

442
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,080
It's an unknown number, Mom.
Probably nothing important.

443
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,120
What if it's about work?

444
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,800
TURN OFF

445
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,240
He's not picking up.

446
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,440
So, what do we do now?

447
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,960
Yos.

448
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,400
Is there something wrong?
Is that why we have to move?

449
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,400
Nothing, Mom.

450
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,480
I think this house is old.

451
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,800
I want to take you somewhere better.

452
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,840
But I like it here.
People in the neighborhood are nice.

453
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,360
Besides, I'm getting old.

454
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,400
I don't know
if I can adjust to a new place.

455
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,680
The new place
is close to the market and a hospital.

456
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,320
And I'll be there with you.

457
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,800
Alright. Just give me some time.

458
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,720
Sin, why is the land deal
in Nakhon Sawan taking so long?

459
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,720
<i>Two more landowners</i>
<i>haven't agreed to sell yet, sir.</i>

460
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,200
I was thinking
of sending Yos to handle it.

461
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,120
Since he's from the area,
it should be easier.

462
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,880
Then call him.

463
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,600
I've tried calling him multiple times,
but he won't pick up.

464
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,600
Fine. I'll call him myself.

465
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,160
Also, sir.

466
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,200
<i>About the thing you asked me</i>
<i>to investigate, I have an update.</i>

467
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,160
Good.

468
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,920
Yes, sir?

469
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,040
Yos, I've been calling you.
Why haven't you answered?

470
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,200
I… I had my phone on silent.
I didn't hear it.

471
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,560
Do you need something?

472
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,360
Nothing. I just wanted to confirm with you

473
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,200
about Ratree.

474
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,840
Are you sure she has moved upcountry?

475
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,080
Yes, sir. I checked.

476
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,320
She's already moved.

477
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,480
Good.

478
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,000
Now you can take care
of your mother without worry.

479
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,960
- Mom.
- Yes?

480
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,120
- I'm going out. I'll be back.
- Alright.

481
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,640
Your home…

482
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,240
looks so peaceful, Ratree.

483
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,400
Unlike mine,

484
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,920
big, but suffocating.

485
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,120
I don't know how to act anymore.

486
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,640
I don't even know

487
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,760
if I really know him.

488
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,360
I feel trapped and uneasy, Ratree.

489
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,120
Ms. Sasi.

490
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,800
If you ever feel uneasy,

491
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,200
you can always come here.

492
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,720
How's the house situation?

493
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,760
The paperwork isn't done yet.
They need about another week.

494
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,280
Can you find me a rental in the meantime?
I want to move out soon.

495
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Why the rush?

496
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,440
Alright, alright. I'll see what I can do.

497
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,920
Thanks.

498
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,600
Why are you home early today?

499
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,440
I finished work early today.
What about you? Where have you been?

500
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,640
I met up with some friends.
We were planning our class reunion.

501
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,360
I can arrange it at the hotel for you.

502
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,320
We were thinking of keeping it small.

503
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,040
Then, why not host it here?

504
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,560
I'll talk about it with my friends.

505
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,960
Are you hungry?

506
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,800
I'll go prepare dinner.

507
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,680
Did you make this for me as…

508
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,520
As an assistant chef, of course.

509
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,960
Not even a single heart in this?

510
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,960
Nope.

511
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,280
Are you hungry now?

512
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,040
Mom, when did you and Dad meet?

513
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,560
In college.

514
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,440
Whenever I walked past his faculty,

515
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,000
he always found a way to tease me.

516
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,160
How did Dad flirt with you?

517
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,920
He used to…

518
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,680
ride the bus with me every day.

519
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,160
Never missed a day.

520
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,720
And what won your heart?

521
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,720
I think it was the food.

522
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,200
Every time I cooked for him,
he'd always say it was delicious.

523
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,920
- That's cute!
- So, Mr. Patthawee already won your heart?

524
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,800
Oh?

525
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,400
Not yet.

526
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,320
Not yet?

527
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,400
But I hear you rave
about his cooking all the time.

528
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,920
Well, he's a chef, after all.

529
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,520
Of course,
everything he makes is delicious.

530
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,920
You're just always thinking about food!

531
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,640
No way, Mom!

532
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,760
Mom…

533
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,160
Well…

534
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,040
Kim told me everything.

535
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,400
Please have a seat first.

536
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,560
Were you able to reach Yos?

537
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,920
Not yet.

538
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,440
But I got his address.

539
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,360
And what do you plan to do?

540
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,880
Should I talk to him first?

541
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,760
It's alright. I'll go myself.

542
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,640
I don't want Dad to suspect anything.

543
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,920
Do you think Yos will tell the truth?

544
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,560
I don't know,

545
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,040
but I have to try.

546
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,160
Let me come with you.
I might be able to help.

547
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,680
- Be careful, okay?
- I will, Mom.

548
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,480
You too.

549
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,600
If anything happens, call me right away.

550
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,440
I will.

551
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,640
Yes, Mr. Kim?

552
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,040
I won't be able to pick you up today.

553
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,120
I have urgent business out of town.

554
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,440
Oh, okay.

555
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,280
Drive safe, okay?

556
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,560
I will, Namfah.

557
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,720
Nubdao,

558
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,240
Mr. Wee isn't picking me up today.

559
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,240
Mr. Kim isn't picking me up either.

560
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,640
Well then,
let's take the bus together today.

561
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,920
- Sure.
- Let's go.

562
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,800
Are you sure this is the place?

563
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
Yeah.

564
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,640
You're disgusting!

565
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,200
Let me tell you this.

566
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,560
I have never loved you.
Not even for a second.

567
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,280
Wait, Sasi, no! That's not true!

568
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,240
If this never happened,

569
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,560
I wouldn't have learned the truth,
would I?

570
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,880
Wee and I came to apologize
for what our father did

571
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,960
to your family.

572
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,520
I can't look at someone
who destroyed our family.

573
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,320
Nubdao submitted
her resignation last month.

574
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,240
And why did you quit?

575
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,120
I'm not happy with my job.

576
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,160
You're not happy with your job…

577
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,320
or with someone?

578
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,680
- It's unforgivable--
- Let's stop talking about this.

579
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,520
I think we need some time apart, Mr. Kim.

580
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,560
