1
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
You're full now, right?

2
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
<i>Let's play a game.</i>

3
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,480
<i>The last pair standing</i>

4
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,040
<i>gets to pick who does the dishes.</i>

5
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,840
Kim, can I ask you something?

6
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,120
- Please don't tell anyone about this.
- Of course.

7
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
That includes Nubdao, too.

8
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,760
<i>He didn't sleep well last night.</i>

9
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,600
Kim usually sleeps like a log.

10
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,520
<i>Can I stay for dinner?</i>

11
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,800
But after eating, you need
to go home and get some rest.

12
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,120
Maybe I should just sleep here.

13
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,200
Sure. Uncle Pu's room has some space.

14
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,800
<i>Kim, help me.</i>

15
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Nubdao, I have an urgent matter.
I need to go.

16
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,680
Mr. Wee…
Why does my heart always beat so fast

17
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,520
when I'm near him?

18
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,440
<i>Her physical injuries</i>
<i>suggest two possibilities.</i>

19
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,280
Either she was assaulted
or she harmed herself.

20
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,320
No way. She wouldn't hurt herself.

21
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,680
Come on, sis. I came home late
because I was visiting you here.

22
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,520
That's just an excuse.

23
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,640
But if you're worried about the kids,
just visit them. Stay over sometimes.

24
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Tell me.

25
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
In what capacity do you expect me
to return to my kids?

26
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,840
I've never even been
a good mother to them.

27
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
I wish I could say I love them,

28
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,399
hug them, or kiss them. But I can't, Pu.

29
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
Today, I was so happy.

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,120
I've never been this close
to my children before.

31
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,640
Me too, sis.

32
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,520
I've been waiting
for this moment for so long.

33
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,200
The day you'd finally get to see them,

34
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
even if just for a short while.

35
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,280
Hey, how about this?

36
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Next time you get a day off, let me know.

37
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Let me know in advance.
I'll find a way to sneak you in again.

38
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,040
Thanks, Pu.

39
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,280
Are you sure you'll make it smooth?

40
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,160
Of course. I'm the master.

41
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,400
Nubdao.

42
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Do you remember anything about Mom?

43
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Tell me about her.

44
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,840
When Mom passed away, I was only two.

45
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,400
Dad used to say

46
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,680
I wouldn't sleep
unless she rocked me to bed.

47
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,440
He also said I was a crybaby.

48
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
I'd only stop crying if she carried me.

49
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,840
What about me? Was I a crybaby too?

50
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
No, not really.

51
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,000
I wish I had some memories of her,

52
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
but I guess that's impossible now.

53
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,800
Hey!

54
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Crybaby confirmed!

55
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You still haven't grown out of it?

56
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,840
Who's a crybaby?

57
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480
Your eyes are all red.

58
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,120
Where's Kim?

59
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,280
He's not coming today.
I think he got home late last night.

60
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
I didn't see his car at home
when I got back either.

61
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,040
He probably overslept this morning.

62
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,360
Then, let me drive you today.

63
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,720
Thank you so much.

64
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,560
Namfah should be ready soon.
She'll be out in a bit.

65
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,360
Looks like she already left.

66
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,400
I must've just missed her.

67
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,960
Hello?

68
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Yeah.

69
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,280
I already left.
Sorry for not waiting for you.

70
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,040
But I'm still waiting for you.

71
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,120
You were up late
because of a birthday party, right?

72
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't go. My friend
had a fight with her boyfriend.

73
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,840
And what about you?
Are you mad at me for something?

74
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,520
I'm not mad!

75
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,920
Definitely.

76
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,360
Nubdao, let's go together today.

77
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,400
You should sit in the front
with Mr. Pathawee.

78
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,360
I'm too sleepy. I'll sit in the back.

79
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,920
Namfah, sit properly.

80
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
Here's a blanket.

81
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,120
Thank you.

82
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,640
Namfah, do you have
a problem with Mr. Pathawee?

83
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,880
No.

84
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,640
Why did you sit in the back?

85
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
I told you, I'm sleepy.

86
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,520
That's the only reason?

87
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
Of course.

88
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,000
Stay here for now.
You'll be safe from your stepfather.

89
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

90
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,680
Here are my clothes.
I think you can wear them.

91
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,400
You're letting me stay here.

92
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,400
Won't Nubdao misunderstand?

93
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll explain it to her myself.

94
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,360
"It's been two weeks
since we became a couple.

95
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,960
Let's go on a date tonight."

96
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,000
DID YOU RECEIVE MY GIFT?

97
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,880
SEE YOU TONIGHT

98
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
Talking to Nubdao?

99
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,640
Yeah.

100
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm taking her out for dinner tonight.

101
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,200
Special occasion?

102
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,480
Our two-week anniversary as a couple.

103
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,080
That's romantic.

104
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,080
Enjoy your dinner. I'll be fine alone.

105
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,520
Who said I'll leave you alone?

106
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,920
I hired a nurse to take care of you.

107
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,360
Hello, ma'am.

108
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,720
Please take care of her.
Call me if there's anything.

109
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
Yes, sir.

110
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,760
Where's your secretary?

111
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,240
On sick leave.

112
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,520
And what wind brought you here?

113
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
The wind of love.

114
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,080
How much love?

115
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,600
A lot of love, dear brother.

116
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,480
Wait, don't tell me…

117
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,920
Your little sister is my girlfriend now.

118
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,760
Seriously?

119
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,720
Yup. Yesterday, I even
went with her to the hospital.

120
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,160
And?

121
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,840
And she let me carry her gift basket.

122
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,680
Plus, she took me along
to visit her friend.

123
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,160
That's it?

124
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,640
That's why you think
she's your girlfriend now?

125
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,480
When two people are in love,

126
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,400
they don't need words. They just know.

127
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,680
Oh, and I saw your brother
at the hospital too.

128
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
Kim?

129
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,800
Was he dropping off Promtawan?

130
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,240
No, I think he was visiting someone else.

131
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,280
Wow! You look stunning, Nubdao.

132
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,680
Are you sure you're not an angel instead?

133
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,400
Nubdao,

134
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,120
if Mr. Kim proposes tonight,
don't play hard to get, okay?

135
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,920
Look, your Prince Charming is here!

136
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,440
So beautiful.

137
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm talking about you…

138
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,920
not the dress.

139
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,120
I bet I'm the only one who remembered.

140
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,960
This is my first relationship,

141
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,800
so I didn't know
which dates I had to remember.

142
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
I never remembered with anyone else.

143
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,640
After dinner, let's go watch a movie.

144
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
Sure.

145
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,960
What genre do you like?

146
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,720
Horror.

147
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,440
I can't handle that. I get scared easily.

148
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,520
With me, you don't have to be afraid.

149
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,200
Hello?

150
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
Okay. I'll be right there.

151
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,280
The nurse said my friend disappeared
and hasn't been found yet.

152
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,800
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

153
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm sorry.

154
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,640
Excuse me?

155
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
When did you last see her?

156
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,240
After she finished eating,
she fell asleep,

157
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,840
so I went to use the restroom.

158
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
When I came out, she was gone.

159
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,120
Did she take her phone?

160
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,240
No, she didn't.

161
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,160
Mr. Kimhan!

162
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,920
Yada…

163
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,440
No one understands me.

164
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,080
I do.

165
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,080
You know I do.

166
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,120
I've been through this too.

167
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,040
I'm so tired.

168
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,800
I have no one left.

169
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,880
You still have me.

170
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,000
You have me, Yada.

171
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,600
Nubdao, how was the dinner?
Was the food good?

172
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,240
Where's Mr. Kim?

173
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,280
Nubdao,

174
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,760
are you okay?

175
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,280
I brought Pad Thai for you guys.

176
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
Mr. Wee!

177
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,280
This one is very good.

178
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Now is not the time
to be excited about food.

179
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,280
Who would have the appetite
for food right now?

180
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,560
I'll eat it. Thank you.

181
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay.

182
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,640
Mr. Kim took her on a date,

183
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,800
but something happened.

184
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,240
I heard he went to find his friend
in the middle of their date.

185
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Mr. Kimhan said he found his friend.
Everything's okay now.

186
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,880
That day, Talay told me
he saw Kim at the hospital.

187
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,600
He must have visited this same friend.

188
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,640
I wonder if it's a male or female friend.

189
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,240
Mr. Wee,

190
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,520
do you think an ex
can still be called a friend?

191
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,800
Not sure. I've never had a girlfriend.

192
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,640
What about you?

193
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,040
I…

194
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I've never had a boyfriend either.

195
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,760
There, there.

196
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,440
Heal quickly.

197
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,320
And from now on,
don't think about the painful past,

198
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,720
little wound.

199
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,760
In a relationship,

200
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,200
what is the most important thing?

201
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,320
I think trust.

202
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,960
If you don't trust each other,
how can you move forward?

203
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,960
Like us, right?

204
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,560
What do you mean?

205
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
Because…

206
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,560
I love you, and I trust you.

207
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,640
I trust you too, Namfah,
and I love you the most.

208
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,960
It's late now, dear brother.

209
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
And where are you off to?

210
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,360
Picking up a package.

211
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,000
What's this?

212
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Some clothes and essentials for you.

213
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,960
Thank you. I was just telling the nurse
I needed to go out and buy some things.

214
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,160
Wearing your clothes downstairs

215
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
gets me weird looks.

216
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,240
I think you should rest more first.

217
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,080
Don't go out just yet.

218
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,920
Okay.

219
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,480
Here's your medicine.

220
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,600
Kim?

221
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,560
What are you doing here?

222
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,200
Dropping something off for a friend.

223
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,720
What about you? Why are you here?

224
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,880
I had a few too many drinks last night,
so I stayed over with my friend.

225
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,880
Do you stay over here often?

226
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,000
Not really.

227
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,480
Kim.

228
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,120
You can go down first.
I forgot something in my friend's room.

229
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,400
Is every week often though?

230
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,719
Hey, what's the matter?

231
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,520
Tomorrow?

232
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,320
No, I can't. I have to be
with my patient at the penthouse.

233
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,080
New office, same coffee, right on time.

234
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,159
Where did you find your friend last night?

235
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,360
The rooftop.

236
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,760
You're lucky you found them in time.
Was this a university friend?

237
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,920
A friend from university.

238
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,360
Just don't forget
to take care of yourself too, okay?

239
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,640
Thank you.

240
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,760
Alright.

241
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,760
Mr. Kong, I need you to find a house
that's ready to move into immediately.

242
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,840
I need a ready-to-move-in one.

243
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
No, not for me. It's for a friend.

244
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,840
Please handle it.

245
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,880
This is urgent.

246
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,480
Just give me a little more time, Nubdao.

247
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,480
Are you catching a cold?

248
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,080
Did you take any medicine?

249
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,040
Not yet.

250
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,600
Why don't you take medicine
and rest in the infirmary for a while?

251
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,520
It's alright.

252
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,120
Go rest. I'll handle things here.

253
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,480
Thank you.

254
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,720
Welcome to Oriental Paradise,

255
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,680
ma'am.

256
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,000
I have a reservation.

257
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,080
- May I have your name, please?
- Mew.

258
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,920
It's nice going home together for once.

259
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,320
Nubdao, you feel feverish. Are you okay?

260
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,200
I think I caught Waree's cold.

261
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,960
Let's stop by the pharmacy
before heading home.

262
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Nubdao!

263
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,120
I made it in time to take you home, right?

264
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,000
Hurry. Nubdao's not feeling well.

265
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
You're burning up.

266
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,440
I'll take you to see a doctor.

267
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,720
Mr. Kim…

268
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,640
I can walk.

269
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

270
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,120
Mr. Kim!

271
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,080
Hey, put me down!

272
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,280
I don't know if Nubdao is actually sick,
but Mr. Kim is definitely burning up.

273
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,360
Namfah, do you have medicine at home?

274
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
No.

275
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,480
I'll stop by a pharmacy.

276
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,200
Are you cold?

277
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm fine now.

278
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,120
NURSE

279
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,600
Oh, it's a nurse calling.

280
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,760
What should we do, Nubdao?

281
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,440
NURSE

282
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,480
<i>Hello?</i>

283
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,400
Hello. Mr. Kimhan
isn't available right now.

284
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,040
Is there something urgent?

285
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,760
<i>I just wanted to update him</i>
<i>that Ms. Yada has a fever.</i>

286
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,720
Who again?

287
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,080
<i>Ms. Yada, ma'am.</i>

288
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,000
I see. I'll let him know.

289
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
<i>Thank you.</i>

290
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,080
Nubdao,

291
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,880
if you're not feeling well,
don't push yourself.

292
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,200
If your fever gets worse tonight,

293
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
call me, okay?

294
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,840
I'll head out now.

295
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,360
Mr. Kim.

296
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,000
Your friend has a fever.

297
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,040
I see.

298
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,320
When you were buying medicine,

299
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,200
the nurse called.

300
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,040
I answered for you.

301
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,360
Are you sure it was Yada?

302
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,440
I heard it clearly.

303
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,280
Ms. Yada has a fever.
You really didn't know?

304
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
I know.

305
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,320
She took sick leave.

306
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,040
But I just found out now that
she's the friend Kim is taking care of.

307
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,960
You just found out? Are you sure?

308
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,440
Yes.

309
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,200
<i>I saw your brother at the hospital too.</i>

310
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,760
Kim?

311
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,880
Was he dropping off Promtawan?

312
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,120
No, I think he was visiting someone else.

313
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,080
Kim, what are you doing here?

314
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,000
Dropping something off for a friend.

315
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,920
How is Nubdao now?

316
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,040
She seems okay on the outside.

317
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,600
But inside, I really don't know.

318
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,480
She always said

319
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,760
trust is the most important thing
in a relationship.

320
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,280
Actually,

321
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,600
if Mr. Kim had just told her that it was
Ms. Yada, this wouldn't be an issue.

322
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,320
Why did he keep it a secret?

323
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,680
Right?

324
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,360
Yeah.

325
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,000
Call Mr. Kim again. Why isn't he here yet?

326
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,160
I've called him multiple times, ma'am.

327
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,680
Did you tell him I have a fever?

328
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,840
A woman answered the phone,

329
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,680
but I passed the message along.

330
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,280
Who?

331
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,280
I didn't ask for her name.

332
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,840
Hello, Mr. Pathawee.

333
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,120
How are you feeling, Yada?

334
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,120
Are you getting better?

335
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,320
I feel much better now.

336
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,880
Did the doctor say
how long you need to stay in the hospital?

337
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,200
I'm back home already.

338
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,240
Oh, you're home?

339
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,400
<i>Yes.</i>

340
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,640
I sleep much better at home.

341
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,520
Okay, then. I won't bother you.

342
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,280
Alright.

343
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,680
Home?

344
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,520
Why is she still awake?

345
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,840
Which hospital is closest?

346
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,520
Kim.

347
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,920
Namfah told me your friend is really sick.

348
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,200
What happened to your friend?

349
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,640
She was abused by her stepfather.

350
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,680
She's in bad shape,
both physically and emotionally.

351
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,600
I don't want any woman
to go through what she did.

352
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,800
Mom…

353
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,680
No woman

354
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,920
should suffer like you did.

355
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,640
Do you think Nubdao will understand me?

356
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,960
YADA PHAKAMAS

357
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,280
Are you at home right now, Yada?

358
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,360
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

359
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,680
I'll drop by to see you then.

360
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,960
You don't need to come.

361
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,240
I feel much better now.

362
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,640
Nurse, can you come with me?

363
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,800
Where are you going, ma'am?

364
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,240
I need to pick up something from home.

365
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,960
- Hello, Mr. Pathawee.
- Hello.

366
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,680
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

367
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,760
This way, please.

368
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,120
You really didn't have to go through
the trouble of visiting me at home.

369
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,960
You're my secretary.
Of course, I had to come check on you.

370
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,440
Thank you.

371
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,920
Of course.

372
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,080
You have a nurse at home?

373
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,880
Yes, since I live alone,

374
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,920
I hired a nurse to help me recover.

375
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,720
I see.

376
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,560
Ms. Yada, you look pale.
Are you feeling unwell?

377
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,360
Yes.

378
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,800
You should rest at the infirmary.

379
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,480
It's alright.
I'll just go to the hospital later.

380
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,320
My friend is seriously ill.
This friend has no one.

381
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,720
I had to take them to the hospital.

382
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,440
How's your friend now?

383
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,960
Still bad.

384
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,360
Was this a university friend?

385
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,400
A friend from university.

386
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,720
The nurse said my friend disappeared
and hasn't been found yet.

387
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,640
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

388
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,080
<i>I just wanted to update him</i>
<i>that Ms. Yada has a fever.</i>

389
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,840
<i>In a relationship,</i>

390
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,400
what is the most important thing?

391
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,320
I think trust.

392
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,840
If you don't trust each other,
how can you move forward?

393
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,320
MR. KIMHAN

394
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,920
Yes, Mr. Kimhan?

395
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,000
How are you feeling?

396
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,000
I'm getting better.

397
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,080
You need to take all your medicine

398
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,200
and get plenty of rest.

399
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,240
If your fever comes back,
call me right away, okay?

400
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,960
Okay.

401
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,720
I won't bother you then.

402
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,360
Wait, Mr. Kim.

403
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,600
Did you order yet?

404
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,640
If not, I can order for you.

405
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,960
Do I know the friend
you've been taking care of?

406
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,160
No, you don't.

407
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,080
I guess I've never met this friend either.

408
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,440
Never.

409
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,760
Then, it's not Ms. Yada?

410
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,120
<i>Kim, can I ask you something?</i>

411
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,320
Please don't tell anyone about this.

412
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,360
It's embarrassing.

413
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,960
<i>That includes Nubdao, too.</i>

414
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,480
If I wanted to visit your friend,
would I be able to?

415
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,320
Right now, my friend
doesn't want to see anyone.

416
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,840
So, your friend…

417
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,040
She's getting better now, right?

418
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,120
NURSE

419
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,320
NURSE

420
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,760
Pick it up.

421
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,440
She might have gone missing again.

422
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,360
Or maybe…

423
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,160
Ms. Yada's fever came back.

424
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,520
<i>Life is just like this carousel.</i>

425
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,160
It has its ups and downs,

426
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,960
happiness and sadness,

427
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,840
spinning in cycles.

428
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,840
The more hardships we endure,

429
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,640
the closer we are to happiness.

430
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,800
<i>Why do you want to explain</i>
<i>yourself to me so badly?</i>

431
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,800
<i>How did you know I'd be back?</i>

432
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,320
<i>I saw your car key over there.</i>

433
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,760
I left it there intentionally.

434
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,920
You're up early today.

435
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,120
Not too early or too late, right?

436
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,840
For me to pick up my girlfriend
for work every morning.

437
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,400
I feel sorry for your friend.
Being all alone like that.

438
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,840
So, I have to take care of them.

439
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,680
I haven't had much time for you lately.

440
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,720
Alright.

441
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,280
But even if I have less time,

442
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,520
I still love you just the same.

443
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,040
Aran always told me he would marry me.

444
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,000
So, why did he leave me?

445
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,880
And your child?

446
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,080
He left me with nothing but this.

447
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,800
This is all I have. I have no other proof.

448
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,800
What's this?

449
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,280
A key to a rental home.

450
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,560
A gift for you and your mother.

451
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,040
<i>I guess I'm not Mr. Kim's trust anymore.</i>

452
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,680
Why do you think that?

453
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
Because I was never worth trusting.

454
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,400
You're the one who needs to stop.

455
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,120
I'm giving back all your time.

456
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,800
