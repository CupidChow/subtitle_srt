1
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
<i>Heal quickly.</i>

2
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,280
And from now on,
forget about the painful past,

3
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,920
little wound.

4
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,720
I misunderstood him. I thought
he was stopping me from running the page.

5
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
If you're going to work here,
you better know who to listen to.

6
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
Don't think for a second

7
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,480
that your so-called master
can protect you.

8
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,840
You took that photo
and leaked it, didn't you?

9
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,720
Aren't you jumping to conclusions
too quickly?

10
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,920
Creating drama
is something you're quite skilled at.

11
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
You need to help me with something first.

12
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
Help you with what?

13
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,200
Invite Nubdao to have lunch with me.

14
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,480
If I get close to Ms. Sasi,

15
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,800
I might be able to find proof
about Mr. Aran's death.

16
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
I've arranged it.

17
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,640
<i>See you this evening.</i>

18
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,920
<i>Ms. Sasi just wanted to treat me to lunch</i>
<i>as a thank-you for the press conference.</i>

19
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,240
<i>Why do you want</i>
<i>to explain yourself to me so badly?</i>

20
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
How did you know I'd be back?

21
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
I saw your car key over there.

22
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,000
The mission failed today.

23
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Wee.

24
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,360
It's okay. Let's just eat.

25
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
Alright then.

26
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
Here you go.

27
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
Thank you.

28
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,080
Wait.

29
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,480
You might not get to have dinner
with the Mystery Chef, just with me.

30
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,880
Mr. Wee, do you think the Mystery Chef
would like this kind of atmosphere?

31
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,400
What kind of food would he like?

32
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,360
What kind of woman does he prefer?

33
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,520
Does he like Thai women?

34
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,680
Do you think he'd like
someone like me, Mr. Wee?

35
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,400
Why aren't you answering?

36
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,520
Would he like me? Would he?

37
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
He would.

38
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,080
Today might not be our day.

39
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,320
- But tomorrow evening…
- Tomorrow?

40
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,120
How long should I boil the santol, Ratree?

41
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Just until the flesh softens,
then you can take it out.

42
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,960
Where did you get this recipe from?

43
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,440
Someone once told me.

44
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,920
The flesh is perfectly tender now.
You can take it out, Mirantee.

45
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
Yes, sir.

46
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,080
So, we let it drain

47
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,440
before soaking it in syrup, right?

48
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
Oh, no need for that.

49
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
You can put the santol

50
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
in this container.

51
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,680
And pour the syrup

52
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,280
until it fully covers the santol.

53
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,280
Try it.

54
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,960
Like this?

55
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,760
Maybe a little more.

56
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,680
- Okay.
- Alright, done.

57
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,880
Now, we put the whole container
in the freezer.

58
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,560
The syrup will form ice crystals,

59
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,720
so when it's ready to eat, you just
take it out, no need for extra ice.

60
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,520
Frozen Santol in Syrup.

61
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,520
That's right.

62
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
- Did you get the picture?
- Yes, sir.

63
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,200
What? You took a picture?

64
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,680
Oh no. I didn't even put on makeup.

65
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,120
- My face must be oily.
- Don't worry. Look.

66
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
Natural beauty.

67
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,880
Thank you.

68
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,720
Here it is.

69
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you. My face is really oily.

70
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,400
My former boss gave me this recipe.

71
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,680
They must have been quite a cook.

72
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,320
Yes.

73
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,160
It's a shame he passed away.

74
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,200
It's been over 20 years now,

75
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,000
and no one really knows
the true cause of his death.

76
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm sorry, Ratree.

77
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,600
Thank you.

78
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,040
I used to have a friend

79
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,520
who would often make
Frozen Santol in Syrup for me,

80
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,120
but he, too, passed away
over 20 years ago.

81
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,400
Surely he can't be the same person
as your boss, can he?

82
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah.

83
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,200
I don't think so.

84
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
Oh.

85
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,320
I think it's ready.

86
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,680
The texture is just right.

87
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,400
Shall we take it out, then?

88
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
Yes.

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,880
What's up so early in the morning?

90
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,960
What?

91
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,280
What's wrong with you?

92
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,960
Come on. Let me do it.

93
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
Move aside.

94
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,600
- Short and still acting bold.
- Thank you.

95
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,840
Namfah.

96
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,200
You decorated this place so nicely.
What's the special occasion?

97
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,640
A special guest is coming
to have dinner with Nubdao.

98
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,440
Who?

99
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,960
Mr. Pathawee.

100
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,680
Which one is he?

101
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,600
The tall, handsome, fair-skinned one,

102
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
Uncle Pu!

103
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
Do I have a twin?

104
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,800
Oh, please.
He's way more refined than you.

105
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,760
You know nothing!

106
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,000
Are you trying to play matchmaker now?

107
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
You could say that.

108
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
You really are growing up.

109
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,200
Why are you cleaning the house
all of a sudden?

110
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,040
We have a guest.

111
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,080
Who?

112
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,120
Me.

113
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
Mr. Pathawee?

114
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,040
Oh, Mr. Pathawee.

115
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,320
Please, come in. Come in.

116
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
Take a seat.

117
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Thank you.

118
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,320
Let me get you some water.
One glass of water!

119
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,920
Just a moment.

120
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,320
Here, hydrate yourself.

121
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Mr. Nephew-in-law. Oops.

122
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,640
I mean, Mr. Pathawee.

123
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,920
Refreshing?

124
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,240
Yes.

125
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
Uncle Pu!

126
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
Oh, well.

127
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,160
Is there any food you particularly like?

128
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,800
I can eat anything.

129
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,200
Even a simple hot omelet over rice
is special to me.

130
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,040
Do you like it fluffy or crispy?

131
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,000
Both, I guess… There's a difference?

132
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,920
Of course.

133
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,640
You can actually make omelets
in 1,209 different ways.

134
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,040
Do you have that much time?

135
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
I'd love to show you one by one.

136
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,280
Thank you.

137
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,800
I didn't know

138
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,480
you were this knowledgeable about food.

139
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,920
I thought you were only
interested in management.

140
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,960
Back when I studied abroad,

141
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,680
I cooked for myself often.

142
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,400
Cooking makes me happy.

143
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,480
No wonder
he had time to learn 1,209 recipes.

144
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,280
Excuse me for a moment.

145
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,000
Of course.

146
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,920
Yes, Mr. Kimhan?

147
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,240
Have you made it home?

148
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,920
For a while now.

149
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,360
Tired today?

150
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,520
Not really.

151
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,440
Have you eaten?

152
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,440
Mr. Kimhan, I need to tell you something.

153
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,320
What is it?

154
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,240
Namfah invited Mr. Pathawee over
for dinner tonight.

155
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,400
Oh…

156
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,920
Really?

157
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,920
Have you started eating?

158
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,000
Not yet.

159
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,400
Then go ahead and eat.
I won't disturb you.

160
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,960
Wait. Don't hang up yet.

161
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,920
What is it?

162
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,200
Are you mad at me?

163
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,720
Why would I be mad?
Namfah invited him, right?

164
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,320
Yes.

165
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,800
Alright, I'll go help Namfah
with the cooking now.

166
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,360
Okay.

167
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,400
Alright.

168
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,120
Namfah, what are you making?

169
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,640
I'm about to make
stir-fried minced pork with holy basil.

170
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,800
Let me help.

171
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,760
Oh no, Mr. Pathawee.
Your shirt might get stained.

172
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,280
Exactly. If you get your shirt dirty,
all your charm will be gone.

173
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,400
It's just a simple dish.
I can handle it myself.

174
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,120
You're using Chinese garlic?

175
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,080
I think Thai garlic would be better.

176
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
More fragrant and a stronger taste.

177
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,280
Uncle Pu,

178
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
can you buy some?

179
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,960
Alright!

180
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,320
Sorry to trouble you, Uncle Pu.

181
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,280
No problem, but I'm afraid

182
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,760
the market might be closing soon.

183
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,080
Will I make it?

184
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,840
You can use the rest
to buy your favorite drink, Uncle Pu.

185
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,920
- All of it?
- Yes.

186
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,880
Uncle Pu…

187
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,720
Garlic is expensive these days.

188
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,640
Wait. You just took everything?

189
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,440
And the basil?

190
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Red holy basil.

191
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,800
It's more aromatic
than the white one when stir-fried.

192
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,080
I picked the small-leaved ones
with flowers still attached.

193
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,880
Perfect. I'll chop the pork,
and you fry the eggs.

194
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,240
Oh.

195
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,160
Got it!

196
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,920
Wow, even the rice is heart-shaped!

197
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,920
Why don't you just make a normal one?
Do you know how long this takes?

198
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,280
Come on. This is a special meal
for your future nephew-in-law.

199
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Fine.

200
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,760
- It's ready.
- All set. Please enjoy.

201
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
Stir-fried glass noodles with egg.

202
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,200
Here it is.

203
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Heart-shaped rice

204
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,000
and even a heart-shaped egg!

205
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,320
Alright.

206
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,760
You have to trust Nubdao.

207
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,000
You can do this, Kimhan.

208
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:02,000
You have to be patient. Trust her.
You can do it. You can do it…

209
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
You can do it.

210
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay, I feel better now.

211
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,400
I can't take this anymore!

212
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
Aren't you both eating?

213
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Uncle Pu, join us.

214
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,400
You and Mr. Pathawee enjoy your dinner.
Uncle Pu and I will eat in the kitchen.

215
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,320
That's right.

216
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,240
Why is my eye twitching?
This means something bad is coming.

217
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,440
- Mr. Kimhan?!
- Mr. Kimhan?!

218
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
I made it in time, right?

219
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,560
The traffic was bad.

220
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,320
Please, gentlemen,
enjoy your dinner to the fullest.

221
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,560
Feel at home here.
Just like it's your second house.

222
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,080
As for me,

223
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,400
I'll just go and have
a light drink inside.

224
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,800
Uncle Pu.

225
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,160
Namfah.

226
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,440
Sit with me.

227
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
Everything looks delicious.

228
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,360
Namfah and Mr. Pathawee made them.

229
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,720
That's right. Every dish is amazing,

230
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,560
especially this one.

231
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,560
Mr. Kim, you should try it.
I guarantee you won't forget the taste.

232
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,000
Right, Mr. Wee?

233
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,880
Yes, absolutely.

234
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,920
Yes.

235
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,760
How is it?

236
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,840
Delicious, right?

237
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,360
If so, eat lots.
The cook put in a lot of effort.

238
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,600
Sure.

239
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,400
I'll eat it for him, Namfah.

240
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,880
Mr. Wee, my sister doesn't eat spicy food.

241
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,240
Thank you.

242
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,680
Mr. Kim, why did you eat that?

243
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,080
It was spicy. You didn't
have to go along with her.

244
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,720
And what about you?

245
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,880
You don't eat spicy food either.

246
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,920
You knew that?

247
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,640
And I also know
why you ate it instead of me.

248
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,440
I think the answer in both our hearts is…

249
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,880
the same.

250
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
I should head home now.

251
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Mr. Kim.

252
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,040
Yes?

253
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,520
Let me know when you get home.

254
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,080
How are you feeling? Tell me.

255
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,360
Just…

256
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,640
a little tight in the chest.

257
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,440
You feel tight in the chest.

258
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,120
For me,

259
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,320
I was stunned.

260
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,960
So…

261
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,640
What will you do next?

262
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,040
I respect Nubdao's decision.

263
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
I don't want to put her
in a difficult position.

264
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,600
In that case,

265
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,880
can I cancel our deal?

266
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,480
Of course.

267
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,040
Good morning.

268
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Good morning.

269
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,520
You're up early today.

270
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
Just a little earlier than usual.

271
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,440
But that means
I get to see you an hour earlier too.

272
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,280
Not too early or too late, right?

273
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,960
For me to pick up my girlfriend
for work every morning.

274
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Shall we go?

275
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,360
Yes.

276
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,960
Are you okay?

277
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,560
I'm okay.

278
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,600
And… did you sleep well last night?

279
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,440
And how's the milk? Still good?

280
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
Still good.

281
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,560
So, that means
he's eating and sleeping well.

282
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,680
What about your heart?

283
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,080
It's still beating normally.

284
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,000
Everything's normal?
No sadness, no loneliness?

285
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,880
And why would I be sad or lonely?

286
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,480
Because of…

287
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,960
Nubdao and Mr. Kimhan.

288
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,080
Well, a little.

289
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,640
A little?

290
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,240
If you're feeling uneasy,

291
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,440
just let it all out.
Don't keep it to yourself.

292
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,840
If you want to vent
or even shout, go ahead.

293
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,840
Just yell.

294
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,080
"Ugh! I'm heartbroken! I'm devastated!
I need someone to comfort me!'"

295
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,200
And that someone is me.
I'll always be here to cheer you up.

296
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,360
- You sure about that?
- Of course.

297
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,680
I've been rooting for you.

298
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,600
How could I just leave you heartbroken?

299
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,680
Yes, Dad.

300
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,000
Got it.

301
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,160
Next month, the French Embassy is hosting

302
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,680
a welcome banquet for a VIP group.

303
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,680
I already confirmed with them that
we'll prepare a special dish for them.

304
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,920
A special dish?

305
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,320
Didn't you say when you first joined that

306
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,640
if we want tourists to remember our hotel,

307
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,200
food is one of the key factors?

308
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,760
Yes, but Kim and the board
didn't agree with me.

309
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,080
Forget them.

310
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,640
Their opinions don't matter.

311
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,120
Besides, I already gave my word.

312
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,320
So, you'll be the project leader.

313
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
Form a team

314
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,520
and come up with a special dish
within two weeks.

315
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Two weeks?

316
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,240
I believe you can do it.

317
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,520
You won't disappoint me, will you?

318
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,760
No, Dad.

319
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,360
And this will also serve
as proof to Kimhan

320
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,280
and the board

321
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,760
that when the vice president
makes a decision, he delivers results.

322
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:04,000
I specifically requested a room
with the headboard facing northwest.

323
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,600
Why did I get a room
where the headboard faces east?

324
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,960
This is serious.
I'm not compatible with that direction!

325
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,520
I sincerely apologize, ma'am.

326
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,760
The guest in that room
extended their stay for another week.

327
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,520
So, what? Am I not important to you?

328
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,719
You're very important to us, ma'am.

329
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,280
That's why we'd like to offer you
a larger room

330
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,880
with a pool view, at the same price.

331
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,040
I don't care about a pool view.

332
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,960
I want a golf course view.

333
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,000
Most rooms with a golf course view
have their headboards facing east.

334
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,280
I'm afraid the headboard
might not be ideal for you, ma'am.

335
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,480
Then, which room
would you recommend to me?

336
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,560
The current one is already great.

337
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,360
Even though the headboard faces east,

338
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,080
you'll get to watch
breathtaking sunsets every evening.

339
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,440
Guests who've stayed here
often leave reviews

340
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,800
saying it gives a romantic atmosphere.

341
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,040
But… I'm staying alone.

342
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,080
Watching a sunset alone,

343
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,640
is that romantic?

344
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
You could take pictures
of yourself with the sunset

345
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,280
and post them on social media.
Sharing beauty is a kind of romance too.

346
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,760
- Right?
- Absolutely.

347
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,160
Alright then. I'll take this room.

348
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,200
- But…
- Yes?

349
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,320
Would you mind coming into my room
to take some photos for me?

350
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,840
You must know the best angles,
where to look elegant

351
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,760
and sexy.

352
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,240
Of course.

353
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,760
Let's go.

354
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,120
You don't like this dish?

355
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,960
I can make something else for you instead.

356
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,080
No need.

357
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,560
Seeing this Tom Kati Sai Bua

358
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,160
makes me think of my daughter.

359
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,360
You know,

360
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,760
when she was still here,
she used to make it for me all the time.

361
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
It tastes just like
how my daughter used to make it.

362
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
Then you should eat a lot.

363
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,680
It's such a pity.

364
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,240
If my daughter were still here, she would
be sitting here eating with me right now.

365
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,280
Come. Sit with me for a bit.

366
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,560
But I'm just a servant.
It wouldn't be appropriate.

367
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,960
I don't even remember
how long I've been eating alone.

368
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,240
Please sit and eat with me, Ratree.

369
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,240
Thank you for understanding
an old woman like me.

370
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,240
Everyone thinks I'm a bitter old lady.
No one ever wants to come near me.

371
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,640
But to me, you're the one
who gave me an opportunity.

372
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,520
Do you have a family?

373
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,920
Yes.

374
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,440
And…

375
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,120
where are your husband and children?

376
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,640
My husband passed away.

377
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,920
As for my children,

378
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,960
I let my brother raise them.

379
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,200
Oh.

380
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,720
Why didn't you raise them yourself?

381
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,760
I wasn't ready.

382
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,760
Don't wait until you're ready, Ratree.

383
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,160
By the time you feel ready,

384
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,640
you might not have the chance anymore.

385
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,000
At least you're better off than me.

386
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,560
Your children are still alive.

387
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,280
But my daughter, she's gone.

388
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,120
I'm sorry to ask,

389
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,240
but how did Ms. Jitsuda pass away?

390
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,880
Because that bastard Taychit cheated
on her with that wretched woman, Sasi.

391
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,520
Jitsuda suffered so much,
her world crumbled until she wasted away.

392
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
And in the end,

393
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,320
she died of heartbreak.

394
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
Sasi…

395
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,520
was originally dating Aran.

396
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,920
But that scumbag Taychit shamelessly stole

397
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,280
his friend's lover and made her his wife.

398
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,320
And Mr. Aran…

399
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,720
He didn't do anything?

400
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,240
Aran was so heartbroken, he shot himself.
What could he have done?

401
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,920
Once Aran was out of the way,
she latched onto Taychit and got pregnant.

402
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,800
Sasi and her son
destroyed my daughter's family.

403
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,840
A Thai dish…

404
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,120
- With a…
- French twist?

405
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,760
How long do we have to prepare?

406
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,760
Two weeks.

407
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,120
Two weeks?!

408
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,480
Is that possible?

409
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,120
Our catering schedule is already packed.

410
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,400
But it's not impossible for us.

411
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,520
This is a big challenge.

412
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,160
Namfah,

413
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,080
I want you as my assistant. Document
every step of the recipe thoroughly.

414
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,080
- Of course!
- And you guys…

415
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
You're my kitchen team.

416
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,800
Ready to go all in!

417
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,960
Let's do it!

418
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,800
Decide among yourselves

419
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,200
on a Thai dish to transform
into a French-style dish.

420
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,320
Present it to me tomorrow.

421
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,640
Yes.

422
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,440
Let's go.

423
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,480
Namfah,

424
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,880
come with me for a bit.

425
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,320
Mr. Wee,

426
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,880
why are we here?

427
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,840
I have an appointment with a friend.
He's a food expert.

428
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,520
Your friend is a food expert? Who is it?

429
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,160
Did I keep you waiting?

430
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,320
Not long.

431
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,480
Fah!

432
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,400
This is Talay, my friend,
and this is Namfah.

433
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,000
Nice to meet you, Mr. Talay.

434
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,280
Nice to meet you too.

435
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,320
Namfah is my staff member.
I've told you about her before.

436
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
- I've met her before.
- What?

437
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,680
I mean, right?

438
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,400
I've heard about her before, right?

439
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,080
Yes.

440
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,160
So, what do you need me for?

441
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,800
I'd like to discuss Thai dishes
with a French twist.

442
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,560
Gladly.

443
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,320
Let me grab a drink first.

444
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,440
I can go get it for you.

445
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,640
It's okay. I'll get it myself.

446
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,200
Order number 33, iced Thai tea
with oat milk, less sweet, is ready.

447
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,440
Oh, it's you!

448
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,960
You!

449
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,320
Are you stalking me?

450
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,920
Stalking what?

451
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,240
This is my Thai tea.

452
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,360
- It's mine!
- But I ordered less sweet.

453
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,520
So did I!

454
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,160
I switched to oat milk.

455
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,200
I did too!

456
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,120
Yes, this is mine.

457
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,800
The last time we met,
you got drunk and threw up in my car.

458
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,160
Now, you're trying to steal my tea too?

459
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,080
So what? You want it back?

460
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,680
- Yes.
- Hey!

461
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,560
Order number 34, iced Thai tea
with oat milk, less sweet, is ready.

462
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,120
Here. This one's yours.

463
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,760
Never thought we'd order the same thing.

464
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,440
Don't use "we". We're not that close.

465
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,840
What's taking so long?

466
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,760
Pathawee!

467
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,040
Promtawan.

468
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,160
Wait, you two know each other?

469
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,760
Hey.

470
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,960
Why did you throw that at me?

471
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,960
Because you're annoying!
Stop pulling me back!

472
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,520
And I'm really pissed
that you're friends with Pathawee.

473
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,480
You're mad at me
just because I'm friends with Wee?

474
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,800
Yes!

475
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,440
That's my LINE.
Don't disappear on me again.

476
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,120
Oh, so you're trying to hit on me?
Not happening.

477
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,000
Nope. But you owe me
for the car wash and my jacket.

478
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,240
Won't you take responsibility?

479
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,680
Last time,
you ran away before settling things,

480
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,320
so I'm not letting you off this time.

481
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,280
Don't forget to reply to my messages.

482
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,360
I met Promtawan once before,

483
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,960
but I never expected her
to be your sister.

484
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,640
She's even more fiery than you described.

485
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,520
Yeah, that's her. You should probably
keep your distance.

486
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,600
She hates my guts.

487
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
She might start hating you too.

488
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,760
Nah…

489
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,200
I have my ways.

490
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,120
I think feisty girls are kind of cute.

491
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,280
Cute?

492
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,320
How about this?

493
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,000
I'll help patch things up between you
and your sister.

494
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,880
Sounds good?

495
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,360
Not happening.

496
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,800
You'll see. She'll call you brother.

497
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,920
Excuse me, Mr. Talay.

498
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,640
Have we met before?

499
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
Nope.

500
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,600
But…

501
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,760
Your voice sounds so familiar.

502
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,480
I feel like I've heard it before.

503
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,240
Men's voices tend to sound alike, Namfah.

504
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,000
No, I'm sure I've heard it somewhere.

505
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,440
WE'RE SCREWED

506
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,960
It's very familiar.

507
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,600
DON'T LET ANYTHING SLIP

508
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,520
Mr. Talay, can you say something for me?

509
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,360
Yes?

510
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,240
Yes.

511
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,560
Namfah, have some cake.

512
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,040
Sorry, Namfah.

513
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,920
For what?

514
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,600
Instead of letting you focus
on brainstorming menu ideas,

515
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,000
I brought you here
and you had to see that.

516
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,320
It's fine. I've only heard
of your sister before.

517
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,000
Are you okay?

518
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,520
I'm okay. I'm used to it.

519
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,280
You're not ordinary.

520
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,800
You seem so calm,
but you sure have a lot of enemies.

521
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,000
Is that a compliment?

522
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,360
Yes, it is.

523
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
It's hard to believe, though.

524
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,920
You're such a nice guy,

525
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,960
but people still hate you.
What are they thinking?

526
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,160
But seriously, you're amazing.

527
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,840
Staying calm and composed
through everything.

528
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,520
If it were me, I would've snapped already.

529
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,240
They say people who can stay patient

530
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,200
and keep their emotions in check
are the strongest.

531
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,440
You're incredible, Mr. Wee.

532
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,000
I admire you.

533
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,560
Thank you, Namfah, for always
being such a positive energy for me.

534
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,440
You're not even looking at my camera.

535
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,000
You take pictures of the guest all day.
Aren't you tired of it?

536
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,000
Maybe a little.

537
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,280
But taking photos of someone cute,
a little jealous, and a bit sulky,

538
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,040
I won't get tired of that.

539
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,320
I'm not jealous,
and I'm not sulking either.

540
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,440
Oh, yeah?

541
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,320
Then why didn't you say
a single word to me on the ride home?

542
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,080
I was… focused on listening to music.

543
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,960
Well then,

544
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,840
you should focus on this now.

545
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,960
All of my time

546
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,080
belongs to you alone.

547
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,760
No matter if it's good times

548
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,040
or bad times.

549
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,800
The sunlight will always be near you,

550
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,080
giving you hope,

551
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,320
strength,

552
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,360
and warmth.

553
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,360
Always.

554
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,800
MR. PATHAWEE

555
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,280
Yes, Mr. Wee?

556
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,120
It's late. Aren't you sleeping yet?

557
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,720
Are you about to sleep?

558
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,520
Am I disturbing you?

559
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,760
No, not at all.

560
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,360
I was just surprised.
You never call me this late.

561
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,160
I wanted to ask…
Have you come up with a dish yet?

562
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,400
I've been racking my brain,

563
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,120
but I still can't figure it out.

564
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,680
What's the problem?

565
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,240
Well, the problem is that

566
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,200
it needs to be a fusion
of Thai and French cuisine.

567
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,960
I feel completely stuck.

568
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,600
Take your time. Don't put
too much pressure on yourself.

569
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,440
Okay. I still have
the whole night to figure it out.

570
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,440
<i>Don't stay up too late. How about this?</i>

571
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,160
Tomorrow, I'll pick you up.
You can get some extra sleep in the car.

572
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,360
Are you sure? I don't want to trouble you.

573
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,480
It's no trouble at all.

574
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,440
Alright then! I'll wait for you
at 6 a.m. in front of my house.

575
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,760
Okay.

576
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,080
Okay. Good night.

577
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,720
Why are you smiling so much
just from a phone call?

578
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,760
Why are you grinning nonstop
just from looking at a clock?

579
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,720
"All of my time… belongs to you alone."

580
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,680
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding</i>

581
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,560
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, what time is it now</i>

582
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,880
<i>For our lovely couple?</i>

583
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,840
Oh, you wanna tease me, huh?

584
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,480
- Come here.
- No!

585
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,400
You wanna try me?

586
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,560
Huh?

587
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,760
- I'm going to bed!
- You're not running away that easily!

588
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,440
Fell asleep so fast, huh?

589
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,120
Help my sister.

590
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,160
And what about you?

591
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,160
I hope you're doing well.

592
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,160
Lungo coffee, your favorite.

593
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,280
Maybe the boldness

594
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,640
will make you reconsider and come back
to the coffee you used to love.

595
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,360
Did Miss Yada make this coffee?

596
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,200
<i>Are you sure you can finish it on time?</i>

597
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,440
If not, just tell me,
and I'll find someone else.

598
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,720
<i>I have plenty of easier tasks</i>
<i>for you to prove yourself.</i>

599
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,200
I know you won't let me down.

600
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,840
The chairman himself, personally here
to support his beloved son?

601
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,840
He'll never let me down.

602
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,200
Well then,
I guess I should wish him success.

603
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,720
- <i>Go home.</i>
- But we're not done yet--

604
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,000
I said, go home!

605
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,600
<i>I'm stopping by to support</i>
<i>Pathawee and Namfah.</i>

606
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,800
Do you want to come with me?

607
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,800
I'll pass.

608
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,880
<i>Wee probably</i>
<i>doesn't want me anywhere near him.</i>

609
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,200
Nubdao.

610
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,360
Did you invite him?

611
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,480
