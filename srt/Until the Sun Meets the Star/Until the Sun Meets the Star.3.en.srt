1
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm ready for my final test.

2
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,760
Do whatever you want and make me
walk out of this room willingly.

3
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,360
I can't exactly ask an executive
like you to leave this room.

4
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,040
What now?
How are you going to get me back in?

5
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,440
That’s up to you.
Because I’ve already passed the test.

6
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,120
Welcome home.

7
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I hope you enjoy your happiness
built on our suffering,

8
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,840
just like you and your mother did to us.

9
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
I hereby appoint Pathawee
as the vice president

10
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,040
of Oriental Paradise Group.

11
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,040
‪Interesting.

12
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm really looking forward
to hearing your vision, Mr. Pathawee.

13
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,200
Nubdao! Hurry, come see your sister!

14
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,760
- Namfah.
- Nubdao.

15
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
Come on. Let me help.

16
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
She's with the doctor now.

17
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
She will be okay.

18
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,240
BOONYAVEJ HOSPITAL

19
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,440
Why is the Grim Reaper this handsome?

20
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Am I going to heaven or hell?

21
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,320
My karma points are already low enough.

22
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,280
Ugh, such an arrogant Grim Reaper.

23
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,040
Won’t even answer my question.

24
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
Are you talking to me?

25
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,560
Of course, I'm talking to you.

26
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,480
You’re here to take my soul, aren’t you?

27
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,920
Namfah, you’re awake.

28
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
Nubdao.

29
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
Wait. I’m not dead?

30
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,200
Of course not.
You’re like a cat with nine lives.

31
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,440
If I’m not dead, then who’s this?

32
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,920
Do you want grilled eggs, young man?

33
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
Please help me buy some, dear.
I haven’t sold anything today.

34
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,800
I’ll take them all, Grandma.

35
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,440
<i>Happiness isn’t the same for everyone.</i>

36
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
Even if I don’t live in luxury,

37
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,960
even if I haven’t finished my studies,

38
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,200
I am absolutely sure
I am happier than you.

39
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,320
Bold words.

40
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,040
I’d love to know
where you get that confidence from.

41
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Because people who are truly happy
don’t belittle others' struggles.

42
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,560
Excuse me, Uncle!

43
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,040
Wait a moment.

44
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Here, take these.

45
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,400
Oh, no need to do that.

46
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
Here.

47
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

48
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
This.

49
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,240
Who are you thinking about?

50
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,200
I’m thinking about

51
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
the person who once saved us.

52
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,720
If I could meet him again,

53
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,840
I’d like to thank him properly.

54
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,000
You came home late last night.
Where were you?

55
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,840
I met a hotel employee whose sister had
an accident and took them to the hospital.

56
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,679
Oh dear, is she alright?

57
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
She’s fine now.

58
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Look after them, okay? They’re our people.

59
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
Of course.

60
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,080
Tawan!

61
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,120
Where are your manners?

62
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,320
Food tastes better
when you take it from someone else.

63
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,600
No wonder some people enjoy it so much.

64
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
Sai, make me another.

65
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
Here, Wee. Take mine.

66
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,560
It’s fine, Dad.

67
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,480
I’m not that hungry.
I'll eat at the hotel.

68
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,560
Fine then.

69
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,960
I'm full now.

70
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,440
Can you eat leftover food
just like your mother did?

71
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,160
When will you two
stop treating my wife like an enemy?

72
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,480
I am who I am.

73
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,760
If you don’t like it, move somewhere else.

74
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,240
This is my house.

75
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,200
The house is yours.

76
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,840
But this land is Grandma’s.
Did you forget?

77
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,120
I gave your mother more than enough money.

78
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,600
And what did she do with it?

79
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
Waste her life away.

80
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
And what about the woman
next to you?

81
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,800
Has she been any better?

82
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,320
I don’t even know
how many guys she’s been through.

83
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,800
You can insult me,

84
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
but don’t disrespect my mother.

85
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,320
Why?

86
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,240
What’s so special about her?

87
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,480
She's just a homewrecker
who stole someone else's husband.

88
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
- Wee.
- Come on then.

89
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,840
Enough!

90
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,200
Both of you, get out.

91
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,160
I’m so bored.
When can I leave the hospital?

92
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,200
The doctor will check today.

93
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,600
If the CT scan is clear, you can go home.

94
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,040
Drink this.

95
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,760
My brain can't get any worse.

96
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,520
Thank you.

97
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,240
Well, Nubdao.

98
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,240
How do you know Mr. Pathawee?

99
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,520
Well…

100
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,120
Don't tell me you're dating.

101
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,360
What? No! He’s the hotel owner’s son.

102
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,240
That’s it?

103
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,360
That’s it. What else could it be?

104
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,040
He’s handsome, rich, and kind.
He’s husband material.

105
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,960
I think he has feelings for you.

106
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,880
The way he looks at you…
It’s more than just friendly.

107
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,640
He’s just well-mannered

108
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,080
and friendly, not like his brother.

109
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,960
He has a brother? Is he as handsome?

110
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
He’s good-looking, I suppose.

111
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,720
But his personality? The total opposite.

112
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
Ugh, don’t get me started.

113
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,920
- Ms. Sanguansri.
- Mr. Kim.

114
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,400
Where’s Nubdao?

115
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,160
She took half a day off, sir.

116
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,960
She took leave?

117
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,080
Yes, sir.

118
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,520
After working for one day?

119
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,280
Did she say why?

120
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
Well…

121
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,120
Nubdao!

122
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,120
Mr. Kim?

123
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,320
Why are you here?

124
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,120
Well…

125
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,560
Ms. Sanguansri said you had an accident.

126
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,360
But you look fine. Nothing seems wrong.

127
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,520
My sister was in an accident, not me.

128
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,680
See, Nubdao? I told you I’m totally fine.

129
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,720
Wee?

130
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,360
Kim? What are you doing here?

131
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,080
I just happened to be in the area,

132
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,640
so I came for a health check-up.

133
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
What about you?

134
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,400
Mr. Pathawee
brought my sister to the hospital.

135
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,360
Our new vice president

136
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,480
sure takes great care of his employees.

137
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,120
Maybe we should give him an award
for outstanding management.

138
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,840
A good organization
should treat employees like family, right?

139
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,760
I’d rather train employees
like professional athletes,

140
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,200
play by the rules, follow the strategy,

141
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
and if they’re weak or slow,

142
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,120
replace them.

143
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,280
But that way,
you’ll never earn their trust.

144
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,760
I work for results, not for love.

145
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Keep that in mind.

146
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,280
What about you?

147
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,280
You only took half a day off, right?

148
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Get back to work.

149
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
Understood, sir.

150
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,280
Does your boss even know
how to talk like a decent person?

151
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,560
I should get back to work too.

152
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,320
Come with me, Ms. Nubdao.

153
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,040
That’s alright. I don’t want
to trouble you any further.

154
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,160
Alright.

155
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,520
Namfah, I’ll take you back first.

156
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,960
Come with me.

157
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,840
I can go back on my own.

158
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,680
You have less than 30 minutes left.

159
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,240
If you don’t come with me,
you'll end up late.

160
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,720
Are you using work pressure
to force me into your car?

161
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,400
I could sue you for labor exploitation.

162
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,480
Smart girl.

163
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,760
But I’m not forcing you.
I’m giving you an option.

164
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,760
Who can force you if you don't want to?

165
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,360
But you do realize that
what Ms. Sanguansri hates the most

166
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
is people who are not punctual, right?

167
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,320
You already have one disciplinary warning.

168
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,600
You really wanna risk another?

169
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,040
Fine.

170
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,680
Just this once.

171
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,400
You're walking ahead of me
Do you know where my car is?

172
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,440
I got you here on time.
Won't you thank me?

173
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
Thank you.

174
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,480
If you liked the ride,
feel free to join me again anytime.

175
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,520
That won’t be necessary.

176
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
I don’t like owing people favors.

177
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,320
I didn't take it, Ms. Sanguansri.

178
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,440
I didn't take it.

179
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,840
I really didn't take it.

180
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,040
What happened?

181
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
The guest believes Duangporn
stole her diamond earring.

182
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,120
I didn’t steal it! I swear on my life!

183
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,680
I swear I didn't steal it.

184
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,720
Checked the footage?

185
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,560
We did, sir.

186
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Only Duangporn entered the room.

187
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,200
But I didn’t take the earring!
Please believe me!

188
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,520
Did we offer

189
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,480
to compensate the guest?

190
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,040
We did. But she refused.

191
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,080
She said they're important to her.

192
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,640
Her late husband gave it to her
on their anniversary.

193
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
I really didn't take it.

194
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,840
Mr. Kim.

195
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
People’s eyes don’t lie.

196
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
Are you sure
that Duangporn didn’t steal it?

197
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

198
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,000
If no one took it, then it must
still be somewhere in this room.

199
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,480
We’ve already checked
every inch of the room, Mr. Kim.

200
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,120
If it were still here,
we would have found it by now.

201
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
Wait a second.

202
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
Please take this.

203
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,280
What are you doing?

204
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,320
Let me help.

205
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,920
Thank you.

206
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,520
Here.

207
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,480
Here?

208
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
Got it!

209
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,400
I’m here to help.

210
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,880
Hang in there.

211
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,160
Did you find it?

212
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,960
Yes.

213
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
Duangporn.

214
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,520
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,640
If it weren’t for you,
I’d be in serious trouble.

216
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,040
We don’t even know each other.

217
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,040
Why did you believe in me?

218
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,680
A real thief would have telltale signs.

219
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,400
At the very least,
it would show in their eyes.

220
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,800
But your eyes said you weren’t a thief.

221
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,320
You’re smart and kind.
No wonder Mr. Kimhan hired you.

222
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,080
Does everyone here

223
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,280
have to pass his test?

224
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,320
Not really. You’re the first.

225
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,400
Your shirt button…

226
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,000
Thank you for changing the buttons for me.

227
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,920
No problem.

228
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Fortunately Ms. Sanguansri
didn’t notice first.

229
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Oh.

230
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,880
The vice president wants to see you now.

231
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,400
Which vice president?

232
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,560
I'd like to offer you a position
as my secretary.

233
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
Would you be interested?

234
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,960
Well… I…

235
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,320
You don’t need prior experience.

236
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
A little training,
and you’ll do just fine.

237
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,200
I…

238
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
Are you hesitant
about something, Ms. Nubdao?

239
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,160
Tell him that you're mine.

240
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,280
I hired you as front desk staff,

241
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,000
not as someone’s secretary.

242
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
Ms. Nubdao has more potential than that.

243
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,200
I want her in a position
that suits her abilities.

244
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
She’s only worked here for two days,

245
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,920
and you’re offering her a promotion?

246
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,640
What about the people
who’ve been here for years?

247
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
Let me ask you.

248
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,680
Are you doing this
for the hotel or for yourself?

249
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
Let's not argue about this.

250
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,840
Let Nubdao decide for herself
who she wants to work for.

251
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,080
Well, Nubdao? What’s your decision?

252
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I’m wondering what’s so special about you.

253
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,800
You’ve been here two days, and Mr. Kimhan
and Mr. Pathawee are fighting over you.

254
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,920
You're causing problems.

255
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,080
I’ll give you one day to decide.

256
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,640
Tomorrow, I want an answer.

257
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,800
How much is it again?

258
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,680
Thirty-two thousand baht, ma’am.

259
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Can I pay in installments?

260
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,040
PAYMENT

261
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,880
Actually, Ms. Namfah's bill
has already been settled.

262
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What?

263
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,480
THIRTY-TWO THOUSAND BAHT

264
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,400
Actually, Namfah and I
could have just taken a taxi home.

265
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,840
I didn't want to bother you.

266
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,760
It’s no problem at all. I wanted to.

267
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,280
This is your home? It looks nice.

268
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,440
There's no way it can compare
to your mansion, Mr. Pathawee.

269
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
Namfah!

270
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,000
It’s true. He’s the owner’s son.

271
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,160
His house must be massive.

272
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,000
A big house

273
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
and wealth may not always bring happiness.

274
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,320
That's why people say,

275
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,520
"A happy hut
is better than a gloomy castle."

276
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,680
Then, what is happiness to you,
Mr. Pathawee?

277
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,000
Nub, what do you have for me to eat?
I'm hungry.

278
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Well, I should be going now.

279
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,600
Who was that guy?

280
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,040
Interesting.

281
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
My niece is really attractive.

282
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,600
Even a rich guy is interested in you.

283
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,200
You'd better not let him go.

284
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,680
Stop saying nonsense, Uncle.

285
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,640
Mr. Pathawee and I aren’t anything.

286
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,160
We’re just employer and employee.

287
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,400
Then, hurry up and make him your husband!

288
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,080
I have no time for that.

289
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,120
I’m too busy working my ass off
just to pay for food, rent, and utilities.

290
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,440
Have you ever heard the saying,

291
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,680
"A woman needs a husband?"

292
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,880
And if that husband happens to be rich,

293
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
then you just won the lottery!

294
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,880
Then you don't have to work
your ass off like this.

295
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,360
Uncle Pu!

296
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,840
Your niece just got hit by a car.

297
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,200
Shouldn’t you at least ask how
I’m doing first?

298
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,120
You didn’t even visit me.

299
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,880
Of course, I’m worried.

300
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,800
I was just about to ask.

301
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,080
I’m better now. The doctor said
I can recover at home,

302
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,360
but I’m still a bit sore.

303
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,160
My niece.

304
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,400
So, how much compensation did you get?

305
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,360
How much did you get?

306
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,800
Are you going to keep it all?

307
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,480
Just give me some.

308
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,120
Don't be stingy.

309
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,160
How did you know
that would help us find the earring?

310
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,080
Maybe I’m just more familiar
with the darkness than the light.

311
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
Here you go.

312
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,360
Yes, that’s it.

313
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,160
I’m so sorry. I misunderstood.

314
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,840
Please, madam.

315
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,680
You must make a decision, Nubdao.

316
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,720
I’ve thought about it carefully.

317
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,880
I’ll remind you.
Your decision today is final.

318
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,800
There will be no changing your mind

319
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
unless you resign

320
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,320
or get fired.

321
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,200
I understand.

322
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,120
Agreed, gentlemen?

323
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,200
Agreed.

324
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,960
No problem. I can’t force anyone.

325
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,120
Alright.

326
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,440
Will you be the personal assistant
to Vice President Pathawee?

327
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,760
Or will you remain
as a front office trainee,

328
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,480
your original role?

329
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,800
I choose…

330
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,199
I didn’t expect you to turn down
a personal assistant job for this.

331
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,199
Every position
has its responsibilities and importance.

332
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,719
But I prefer working in the front office.

333
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,280
So, you like fixing
other people’s problems?

334
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
You could say that.

335
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,920
I feel fulfilled when I can help guests
solve their issues.

336
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,040
And what if you fail?

337
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,280
Then I learn from it
and do better next time.

338
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,280
That's so optimistic.

339
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,000
I thought you were living
in a lavender field.

340
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,280
The more we let negativity consume us,

341
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,880
the further we push happiness away.

342
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,040
In the end,
we might miss what truly matters.

343
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,480
I’ll try to remember that.

344
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,080
Mr. Kimhan.

345
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,920
About the hospital bill…
Thank you so much.

346
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
You… You knew it was me?

347
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,600
MR. KIMHAN BOWORNWISUT

348
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,840
I'm hiring you as a front office trainee.

349
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,480
You can start tomorrow.

350
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,360
I recognized it.

351
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,840
It’s the same signature you used
when you hired me.

352
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,800
I’ll make sure to pay you back
as soon as I can.

353
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,560
I knew it.

354
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,920
I knew you’d say that.
That’s why I didn’t tell you.

355
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,840
- I don’t like owing--
- "I don’t like owing anyone."

356
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,520
See?

357
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Alright then, if you already found out…

358
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,480
Pay me back whenever you can.
I’m not in a hurry.

359
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,040
Thank you so much.

360
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,160
She even memorized my signature.

361
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,360
I found a new secretary for you.

362
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,720
Come in.

363
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,480
Good afternoon, Mr. Techit.

364
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,640
Good afternoon, Mr. Pathawee.

365
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,240
I’m looking forward to working with you.

366
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,160
Likewise.

367
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,480
I want to meet this arrogant little girl
who dared turn down your offer.

368
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,320
- Man, that was exhausting.
- I can't do it anymore.

369
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,640
- Too many guests.
- I need a break.

370
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,280
It felt like we were drowning.

371
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,520
Right?

372
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,280
Who’s that?

373
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,160
She's probably a new hire.
I've never seen her before.

374
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,920
Hi there. I’m Maiaek. I'm a chef here.

375
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,480
These two

376
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
are Offroad and Meepooh,

377
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,480
- my assistants.
- Yes.

378
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,720
I'm Nubdao. I work at the front office.

379
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,040
Nice to meet you, Ms. Nubdao.

380
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,800
That soft-boiled egg…
It’s cooked at precisely 77°C

381
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,320
for about five to seven minutes.

382
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,360
The yolk sets into
the perfect gel consistency.

383
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,040
That is a proper soft-boiled egg.

384
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,480
Did you make that yourself?

385
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,120
No, my sister did.

386
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,440
Sounds like she enjoys cooking.

387
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,840
You can tell all that from a single egg?

388
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,800
I considered other elements too.

389
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,960
The yolk texture, egg white consistency,

390
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,400
and even the color of the sauce.

391
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,360
You’re really detail-oriented.

392
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,320
No wonder you’re the executive chef.

393
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,080
Not quite.

394
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,560
Don’t believe him. He’s full of it.

395
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
Stop right there.

396
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,880
Why?

397
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,360
If your sister enjoys cooking,

398
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,040
she should apply
for the kitchen helper position.

399
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,680
We’re hiring right now.

400
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,000
Exactly. The kitchen helper
is responsible for ingredient preparation

401
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,000
and food storage, ensuring
everything meets hygiene standards.

402
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,680
Think your sister might be interested?

403
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,040
I’m in! My dream of becoming a chef
is finally within reach!

404
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,280
But Chef Maiaek said you’ll need to pass

405
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,080
both a written test
and a practical cooking exam first.

406
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,960
- Are you ready for that?
- Absolutely!

407
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,680
I’ll study all night tonight.

408
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,280
Are you sure?

409
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,360
<i>To remove fishy odors,</i>
<i>gut the fish properly.</i>

410
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,840
<i>Eat with me.</i>

411
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,400
<i>Use a sharp knife,</i>

412
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,160
<i>make a precise cut along the belly,</i>
<i>and carefully remove the innards</i>

413
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,040
<i>without rupturing the gallbladder,</i>

414
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,360
<i>as it will make the dish bitter.</i>

415
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,040
<i>And when gutting the fish, it's better</i>
<i>to use your hands rather than a knife…</i>

416
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,920
Namfah, wake up.

417
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,960
Did you turn it off?

418
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,000
Not yet.

419
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,760
Can I sleep a little more?

420
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,080
Come on. Just go and sleep properly.

421
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,320
Go and sleep properly.

422
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,880
Get up. This will hurt your back.

423
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,840
Gently.

424
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,080
I said gently.

425
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,280
Then, what is happiness to you,
Mr. Pathawee?

426
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,760
My happiness…

427
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,520
How long has it been
since we last saw each other?

428
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,760
Ten years?

429
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,480
You haven’t changed a bit.

430
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,160
Can’t say the same for you.

431
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,200
You’re almost unrecognizable.

432
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,240
In what way?

433
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,760
Your looks.

434
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,400
Your style.

435
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,160
Even your drink order.

436
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,320
You didn't expect me
to still drink orange juice, did you?

437
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,480
Some things

438
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,840
are an acquired taste.

439
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,600
At first, you might not like them,

440
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,000
but with time,

441
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,120
you grow to like them,

442
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,880
or even crave them.

443
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,400
Wouldn’t you agree?

444
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,600
I wouldn’t know.

445
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,760
Come on, Kim. Don’t be so cold.

446
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,160
Have you forgotten?
We used to be something.

447
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,840
Tell me…

448
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,600
Am I still your first love?

449
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,600
Happy Birthday.

450
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,360
Thank you.

451
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,880
What are you doing here?

452
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,120
I’m the new secretary
for your little brother.

453
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,320
Don't call that brat my brother.

454
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,200
You still haven’t moved on?
That was ages ago.

455
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,520
Some things don’t just move on.

456
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,120
No matter how much time passes.

457
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,600
Don’t tell me

458
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,760
you’re still mad
just because I broke up with you?

459
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,520
I told you not to serve it!
But you made me serve it anyway!

460
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,840
- But it had to be served!
- In the end, I got scolded.

461
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,560
- You didn't.
- Hey, look.

462
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,480
Go.

463
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,000
Hey there, Ms. Nubdao.

464
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,000
Hello.

465
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,960
Didn’t think you’d be
the superstitious type.

466
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,880
Do you know why the founder’s statue
is placed at the back of the hotel

467
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,400
instead of the front?

468
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,160
Ever since I started working at the hotel,

469
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,840
Mr. Aran's statue has always been here.

470
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,280
The cleaning staff comes by
once in a while to dust it off.

471
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,720
Maybe it’s a feng shui thing?

472
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,360
Don't say you heard it from me.

473
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,400
Heard what?

474
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,880
I heard this statue… is haunted!

475
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,640
Haunted? How?

476
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,800
Let me tell you the story.

477
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,160
Just talking about it gives me chills!

478
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,720
Chills what? This hotel is massive.
There’s no way ghosts exist here.

479
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,560
Ghosts aren’t just in old,
abandoned places, you know?

480
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,560
In any place where someone
has died, ghosts exist.

481
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,560
Do you know how Mr. Aran passed away?

482
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,200
They say Mr. Aran shot himself dead.

483
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,040
And do you know why?

484
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,040
His death remains a mystery to this day.

485
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,520
Mr. Aran died in 1998.

486
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,280
It could’ve been because of
the Tom Yum Kung financial crisis in ’97.

487
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,320
Makes sense.

488
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,240
A lot of people took their own lives
back then because of bankruptcy.

489
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,480
- Exactly.
- See?

490
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,840
That’s why his spirit is still here,
lingering to this day.

491
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,800
Boo!

492
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,880
Are you all having fun?

493
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,800
Mr. Kimhan!

494
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,600
I'm screwed.

495
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,320
I warned you not to gossip about
the executives, even if they’ve gone.

496
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,560
I wasn’t gossiping.

497
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,320
I just wanted to know
why the founder’s statue

498
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,240
was abandoned in the back garden

499
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,320
and the cause of his death.

500
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,920
Why do you care? He's gone.

501
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,080
Knowing won’t change anything.

502
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,600
Studying the hotel’s history

503
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,520
helps us understand its strengths,

504
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,400
weaknesses, and past strategies.

505
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,080
We have to learn from the past
to adapt in the present

506
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,080
and shape the future, don’t we?

507
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,880
And that includes
the cause of the founder’s death?

508
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,400
If his death was linked
to the hotel’s management, then yes.

509
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,320
Well, I'm an executive too.

510
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,840
Aren't you curious about me?

511
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,200
- Nope.
- Why not?

512
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,880
I wouldn’t dare intrude on your privacy.

513
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,680
Let me tell you something.

514
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,280
I am this hotel’s greatest strength.

515
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,040
You better remember that.

516
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,800
Is there a problem, Mr. Kim?

517
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,720
I should get back to work.

518
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,920
Did Nabdao break any rules?

519
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,200
No.

520
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,360
- Or maybe…
- Enough.

521
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,840
No need to guess.
She didn’t do anything wrong.

522
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,200
It’s just that you were talking to her
for quite a while, so I thought--

523
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,600
Ms. Sanguansri,

524
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,280
do you know anything about Mr. Aran?

525
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,400
Why do you want to know?

526
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,960
Just answer me.

527
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,360
Did he really shoot himself?

528
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,520
Can I not go?

529
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,400
Come on. Why would you
shut yourself in the house all the time?

530
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,200
It’s good to get some fresh air.

531
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,080
Besides, you haven’t been
to the hotel in ages.

532
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,360
Even if I go, it won’t make
a difference.

533
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,040
Now, you and Kimhan
are running the place just fine.

534
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,840
The management job is not for me.

535
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,800
But you’re still a shareholder.

536
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,800
It’s good for the employees
to recognize you.

537
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,880
Come with us, Mother.
We can have lunch at the hotel together.

538
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,640
Please.

539
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,120
Fine.

540
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,880
Good.

541
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,280
Has Kimhan woken up yet?

542
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,600
He left for the hotel early this morning.

543
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,480
Who allowed this inside?

544
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,080
I said, who allowed this inside?!

545
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,440
Are you all deaf?
I asked who put this here!

546
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,680
I ordered it moved here.

547
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,960
Kim.

548
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,400
Take it out now.

549
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,120
Did you hear me? I said take it out now.

550
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,080
Mr. Aran was a co-founder.

551
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,320
Why can’t his statue be here?

552
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,240
Because I said no. That’s why.

553
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,360
Why not?

554
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,240
He was your friend, right?

555
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,840
Kim!

556
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,680
- Dad!
- Techit!

557
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,080
I should’ve destroyed it long ago.

558
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,120
We already talked about this, didn’t we?

559
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,160
You still haven't forgotten about him?

560
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,480
I only have you now.

561
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,640
So, in the end, it had to be moved back.

562
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,200
The chairman must have
a painful past with this statue.

563
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,040
My father might never get over

564
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,400
watching his best friend shoot himself
and not being able to stop it.

565
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,560
You knew about Mr. Aran?

566
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,520
That's all I know.
No one likes to bring it up.

567
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,080
It’s a painful wound for my family.

568
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,640
Now that I look at it closely,
you actually resemble him.

569
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,880
Are you saying I look as stiff as a rock?

570
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,880
No! I meant…

571
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,960
You look polite and kind,

572
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,360
just like the statue.

573
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,800
So,

574
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,400
between young Mr. Aran and me,
who’s more handsome?

575
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,360
Well, you both have your own charm.

576
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,840
Ms. Sanguansri.

577
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,440
Tell Nabdao to keep her distance
from Pathawee. I don’t like it.

578
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,800
I don’t like employees
getting too close to management.

579
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,920
I absolutely hate

580
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,160
employees who try
to butter up their bosses.

581
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,040
Don’t worry, I’ll warn Nabdao about it.

582
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,840
And I’ll also make sure

583
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,000
she doesn't cozy up to you either.

584
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,520
No need.

585
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,720
It looks weird.

586
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
What kind of food is this?

587
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,480
No name yet.
It's my first time cooking this.

588
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,640
Let's try.

589
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,920
<i>I saw you talking to Wee alone yesterday.</i>
<i>What were you discussing?</i>

590
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,200
- <i>I can’t tell you.</i>
- Why not?

591
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,600
Because you told me not to.

592
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,240
What exactly did I tell you?

593
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,560
WHITE PRISON

594
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,080
- <i>Pu.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

595
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,120
Break open this cabinet.

596
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,480
<i>This is way too risky.</i>

597
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
<i>You know Techit has money and power.</i>

598
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,160
<i>What are you gonna do to fight him?</i>

599
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,080
<i>Right now, I need your help.</i>
<i>Are you with me, Pu?</i>

600
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,280
No… No! Help me! No!

601
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,440
