1
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,120
Check the video I just sent you.

2
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,640
<i>That woman? She lives alone.</i>

3
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm not her mother.

4
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,840
I gave him a chance
to tell me the truth today,

5
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,680
but he still chose to lie.

6
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,760
<i>I'm returning all the time you gave me.</i>

7
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Nubdao, why don't you hear him out?

8
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe he has a reason.

9
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,800
<i>You knew I couldn't stand it.</i>
<i>So, you made everything up to fool me?</i>

10
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,920
You should never use
someone's weakness against them

11
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,160
for your own amusement.

12
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
Mr. Aran left me this.

13
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,960
It's all I have.
I don't have any other evidence.

14
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
What's his name?

15
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
- Patthawee?
- Patthawee?

16
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
<i>Can you two not tell Namfah just yet?</i>

17
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
I want to tell her myself on her birthday.

18
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,080
I got selected to meet the Mystery Chef!

19
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,400
Where and when do you have to meet him?

20
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,760
Tomorrow at the studio.
They'll send me the location later.

21
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,680
Sasi.

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Did you forget something?

23
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,960
Yeah, this.

24
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,480
You'll have to eat dinner alone tonight.

25
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,560
You should hurry. You don't want
to be late for your meeting.

26
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,800
Alright.

27
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,080
I'm heading out now.

28
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,160
Okay.

29
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,240
<i>Sasi.</i>

30
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,360
<i>I've started to notice irregularities</i>
<i>in the hotel's finances.</i>

31
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,960
<i>I suspect Taychit is betraying me.</i>

32
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,880
<i>I think he's plotting</i>
<i>to take over the hotel for himself.</i>

33
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,120
<i>Sasi, listen to me.</i>

34
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,960
<i>No matter what happens to me,</i>

35
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
<i>I want you to know…</i>

36
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,080
<i>I will always love you and our child.</i>

37
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,560
This message
will never reach the woman you love,

38
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,160
Aran, my dear friend.

39
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,240
ONE ITEM SELECTED

40
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,160
NINE ITEMS SELECTED

41
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
DELETE

42
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,240
It has to be you, Taychit.

43
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,640
I'm so happy for you, Namfah.

44
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,080
I wish tomorrow would come faster.

45
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,760
What should I wear to meet him?

46
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
What about this one?

47
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,360
Or this?

48
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,920
But…

49
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,160
No.

50
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,720
Maybe this one? Is it bright enough?

51
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,680
Uh…

52
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,240
I can't decide. Help me choose.

53
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,720
Wear something
that makes you feel confident.

54
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Something I feel confident in?

55
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,080
With pants…

56
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,280
This one…

57
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,720
With black pants? No, it doesn't match.

58
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,120
This one? Is it good?

59
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,800
Alright, this is it.

60
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
He'll get to see the real me.

61
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,960
What do you think he looks like?

62
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,799
I've only seen his hands.
How could I know?

63
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,600
But judging by his hands…

64
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,880
He has long fingers, so he must be tall.

65
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
Nubdao.

66
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,720
What?

67
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,560
He must be as tall as Mr. Wee!

68
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm finally going to meet him.

69
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm so happy!

70
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
Namfah.

71
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
You know I want you to be

72
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,560
the happiest girl in the world, right?

73
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,880
Of course, Nubdao.

74
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,600
That file must've had an important clue.

75
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,920
Otherwise, he wouldn't have erased it.

76
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Are you sure it was him?

77
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,200
If it wasn't Taychit, then who else?

78
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,400
So, what now? You're just going
to wait around until he catches you?

79
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,200
You keep thinking and thinking.

80
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,400
You forgot what tomorrow is, didn't you?

81
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
What?

82
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,920
It's Namfah's birthday.

83
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
You totally forgot, right?

84
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,280
You thought it was Dad?

85
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
Making it yourself?

86
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Yes.

87
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,880
I wonder

88
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
how Namfah will react
to the Mystery Chef tomorrow.

89
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,760
You'll find out soon enough.

90
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,520
Kim.

91
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
I'll keep watch for you.

92
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,560
Nubdao, let's make the offering together.

93
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Alright.

94
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
Mr. Kimhan, Mr. Patthawee, it's your turn.

95
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
Yes.

96
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,760
Sis, I didn't know they'd be here too.
Or I wouldn't have dragged you here.

97
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,880
Namfah is another year older now.

98
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,880
Yeah.

99
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,200
Give this to her for me.

100
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,360
Why don't you give it to her?

101
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,800
I can't.

102
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,040
Uncle Pu!

103
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,200
Don't tell her it's from me.

104
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
Who were you talking to?

105
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,040
I was talking to the monk.

106
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,440
- Good morning, Uncle Pu.
- Good morning.

107
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,360
Good morning, Uncle Pu.

108
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,760
Why are you so late? You left the house
before me. Where have you been?

109
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,640
Uh… Well…

110
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,360
See? You missed making merit with me.

111
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,960
Come on. I may be late,
but I didn't come empty-handed.

112
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,760
Happy birthday, my dear niece.

113
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,960
You've never given me
anything before. Is this for real?

114
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Uncle Pu,

115
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
is this an empty box?

116
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,080
Or did you steal it from someone?

117
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,360
Tell me, or I won't take it.

118
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,160
- Hey! This gift is from…
- From where?

119
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,320
From my heart, of course!

120
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,760
Uncle Pu, you can't lie in the temple.

121
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,760
Yeah.

122
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,840
- Alright, I'm opening it.
- Go ahead.

123
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,520
Your smile looks suspicious.

124
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,480
Whoa.

125
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,520
I don't give gifts often.
You ask too many questions.

126
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,160
Uncle Pu, this is so sweet!

127
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm sweet by default, didn't you know?

128
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,840
Not you.

129
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,160
I meant this photo frame!

130
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,040
Wayha? Where is Wayha?

131
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Uncle Pu, you still keep these photos?

132
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,200
You said they were all lost in the fire.

133
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,880
I managed to save a few.

134
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,360
I planned to give them to you
for your birthday.

135
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,520
Thank you, Uncle Pu.

136
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm glad

137
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,680
that something so small

138
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,720
could bring you happiness.

139
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,600
We were chubby.

140
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,520
You were adorable as a kid.

141
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,120
You were adorable as a kid, too.

142
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,160
Whoa.

143
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Young people these days…

144
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,680
Namfah.

145
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,720
I have to go take care of something first.

146
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,600
Okay, but make sure
to join us later, alright?

147
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,080
I will.

148
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,040
Kim.

149
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,600
About that time you kneeled,
how did it go?

150
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,040
You'll find out.

151
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,520
Nubdao…

152
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,160
Why haven't they sent the location yet?

153
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,480
Be patient. They'll send it soon.

154
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
But it's almost time.

155
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,720
Do you think he's going to ditch me?

156
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,840
Mr. Kim, Mr. Wee won't ditch her, right?

157
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,680
No, he won't.

158
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,960
Then, why is he taking so long?

159
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,440
He's probably trying to calm himself down.

160
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,360
Just wait a bit.

161
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,440
Nubdao! They sent it!

162
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,360
They sent the location!

163
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
There he is!

164
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,720
Are you Ms. Namfah?

165
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,160
Yes.

166
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,520
Please come inside.

167
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,960
The chef is waiting.

168
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,280
I'm going now!

169
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,760
Happy birthday, Namfah.

170
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,720
Chef…

171
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,080
You…

172
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,600
Namfah!

173
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,800
Mr. Wee, don't follow her yet.

174
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,480
Let her be alone for a moment.

175
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
If we don't follow her now,
how do you know where she's going?

176
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,360
I know.

177
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,560
Are you sure she's here?

178
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes.

179
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,480
Every year on her birthday,

180
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
we come here to eat shaved ice together.

181
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,200
The ice is melting.

182
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
You bought an extra one for me,
didn't you?

183
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,360
I'm sorry.

184
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,320
I love you. And I trust you too.

185
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,440
I trust you too, Namfah,
and I love you more than anything.

186
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,520
I didn't forget.

187
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,080
Mr. Wee wanted to tell you himself.

188
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,000
I never meant to hide it.

189
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,920
I thought…

190
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,200
it would be the most special gift

191
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,280
for your birthday this year.

192
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,960
Because in the past,

193
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,320
I never had a good gift
or anything meaningful to give you.

194
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Don't cry anymore, okay?

195
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,440
Just being able to eat
shaved ice with you every year

196
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,600
is already the most special gift.

197
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,080
Alright, no more crying, okay?

198
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
But…

199
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,560
if you really want this year
to be extra special…

200
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,760
Wait. I haven't even started counting yet.

201
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,640
Hurry up! Hurry up!

202
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,680
Is it good?

203
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,200
If you cry, you lose.

204
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,200
Whoever cries first loses.

205
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,000
- Come on.
- Come on.

206
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,840
Hurry up. Let's race! Quick, quick!

207
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,360
Hey, are you stealing from me?

208
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,080
Just helping a little!

209
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,520
Come on. I almost finished it.

210
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,600
I almost finished it.

211
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,480
Yay! I finished it!

212
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,920
Now that you've won,
are you still mad at me?

213
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,480
I was never mad at you.

214
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,240
But…

215
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,160
I was embarrassed.

216
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,920
Come here, silly.

217
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Come on.

218
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
There, there.

219
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,120
I'm sorry, Namfah.

220
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,480
I'm not mad at you.

221
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,560
I'm just embarrassed.

222
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,960
Embarrassed?

223
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,560
About what?

224
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,800
You want this?

225
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,040
The wooden cutting board
from France with the chef's signature?

226
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,200
How did you get this?

227
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,600
- What do you want most?
- I…

228
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,440
I want to have a candlelight dinner
with the Mystery Chef.

229
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,480
Maybe he doesn't want to reveal his face.

230
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,720
But I really want to meet him.
Mr. Wee. you understand, right?

231
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,120
I understand.

232
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,280
You can't have dinner
with the Mystery Chef.

233
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
How about dinner with me instead?

234
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Do you think he'd like this atmosphere?

235
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,840
What kind of food does he like?

236
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,760
What kind of woman does he like?

237
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,400
Does he prefer Thai women?
Would he like me?

238
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,040
He would.

239
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,160
This is another

240
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,720
French cooking technique, right,

241
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,200
Mr. Mystery Chef?

242
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,680
Namfah…

243
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,600
Yes, Mr. Mystery Chef?

244
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,000
Namfah, stop stirring.

245
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,920
Apart from Talay,

246
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,640
I've never told anyone
about my secret page.

247
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,960
Not even Ms. Sasi?

248
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,560
No.

249
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,520
I didn't want her to have to hide
something else from my dad.

250
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,800
The page is my whole world.

251
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,080
It's where I can be myself,

252
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,720
where I can do what I love,

253
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,360
where no one controls me.

254
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,360
But…

255
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,360
if my dad finds out,
he'll make me shut it down.

256
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,480
And I'll lose my only happiness in life.

257
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,680
I believe you.

258
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I believe the page is your only happiness.

259
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,760
Even though I only saw your hands,
I could feel your passion.

260
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,160
But now…

261
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,440
the page isn't my only happiness.

262
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Why?

263
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,240
Because now, I have you.

264
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,400
Happy birthday, Namfah.

265
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Make a wish.

266
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,640
I don't need to.

267
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,600
Why not?

268
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,680
Because right now…

269
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,920
everything is already perfect.

270
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,600
I made this cake myself. Try it.

271
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,720
How do we eat it?

272
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
I prepared this.

273
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,159
Thank you.

274
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,080
I supervised the production process.

275
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,760
You two don't need to drive us home.

276
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,440
My sister and I can manage on our own.

277
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,040
No way. I'm driving you home.

278
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,080
Yes. I'm taking you home too.

279
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,120
Why waste gas by taking two separate cars?

280
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,920
Because I'm taking my girlfriend home.

281
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,040
And I want to take my…
girlfriend home too.

282
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,840
Let's go, Namfah.

283
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,000
So, what do you want as your first
birthday gift from your boyfriend?

284
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,800
Who's your girlfriend?

285
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,680
Oh? Namfah!

286
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,800
You and Namfah come here every year?

287
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,080
Yes, sometimes Uncle Pu joins us too.

288
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
Can I get Uncle Pu's number?

289
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,680
Why?

290
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,360
In case of emergencies.

291
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,680
We're family now, aren't we?

292
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,760
Hello?

293
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,400
Is that Uncle Pu?

294
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,280
It's me, Kimhan.

295
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,800
Mr. Kim!

296
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,040
Where are you right now, Uncle Pu?

297
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm near the house. Do you need something?

298
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,680
Wow, that looks delicious!

299
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,040
Me?

300
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,360
The spaghetti.

301
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,400
I just fulfilled one of your dreams.

302
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,520
It's amazing!

303
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,920
I never thought I'd actually

304
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,240
get to eat food made by my idol!

305
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm not your idol anymore.

306
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,920
I'm your boyfriend.

307
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,240
When did you start flirting with me?

308
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,200
Mr. Kim.

309
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,080
Do you need something?

310
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,880
I need to ask you something, Uncle Pu.

311
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,560
Sure, what is it?

312
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,800
It was so close, Father.

313
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,840
What is Nubdao's father to Aunt Ratree?

314
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,680
And who are these two?

315
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Whose picture is this?

316
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,160
Do you know anyone in the picture?

317
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,600
Nope. I don't know anyone.

318
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,680
Are you sure?

319
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,600
Absolutely sure. I should get going now.

320
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,480
Is this man Nubdao's father?

321
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,040
No. Where did you even get this?

322
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,840
I saw this man's photo
at your house, Uncle Pu.

323
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,840
Are you sure?
I don't think it looks like him at all.

324
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,320
What about Aunt Ratree?

325
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,200
Do you know her?

326
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,520
I don't know her.

327
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,400
Then I'll ask Aunt Ratree myself.

328
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Mr. Kim, can we talk about this calmly?

329
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,440
How long has Nubdao's father
and Aunt Ratree

330
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,440
been separated?

331
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,800
Oh, since Nubdao
and Namfah were little kids.

332
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,800
So, their father lied to them
that their mother passed away?

333
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,640
That's right.

334
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
And…

335
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,400
Does Aunt Ratree know

336
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,200
how much Nubdao
and Namfah need their mother?

337
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,880
Mr. Kim,

338
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,720
she misses her kids more than anything,
but she isn't ready.

339
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,560
She's waiting until
she can stand on her own two feet.

340
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,480
Uncle Pu,

341
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,440
what should we do now?

342
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,880
When did I ever separate
from Wayha, huh, Pu?

343
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,560
Come on, sis. I had to think fast
when Mr. Kim asked me.

344
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,920
And that's what you came up with?
Wayha loved me more than anything.

345
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,360
Come on, sis.
Just go along with it for now.

346
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,840
Or should I just tell Mr. Kim
that his father sent you to prison?

347
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,920
Sis…

348
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,560
Enough with this revenge thing.

349
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,160
There's no way to prove
your innocence anymore.

350
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,920
I think you should just spend the rest
of your life happily with your kids.

351
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,600
You won't listen to me anyway.
Never mind. I'll just eat.

352
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,440
What did Mr. Aran record in this folder?

353
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,160
I haven't listened to it yet.

354
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,760
NO FILE

355
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,320
Where did the file go?
It was here yesterday.

356
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,720
Sasi.

357
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,800
Aunt Ratree is not like someone else.

358
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,640
She helped us a lot.

359
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,040
Wow, Namfah,

360
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,480
I raised you all these years,

361
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,360
but as soon as Aunt Ratree shows up,
you keep praising her.

362
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,720
You can just call her your mother then.

363
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
That's a good idea!

364
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,880
Why don't you take care
of your kids yourself?

365
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,560
I'm not ready yet.

366
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,480
Don't wait until you're ready, Ratree.

367
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,040
By the time you are,

368
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,600
it might be too late.

369
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,840
You're luckier than me.

370
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,080
Pu…

371
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,440
I want to spend
the rest of my life with my kids.

372
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,080
Sis…

373
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,720
What about me?

374
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,400
You too.

375
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,200
But he's never actually flirted with me.

376
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,720
Maybe he's flirting without flirting.

377
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,600
What do you mean?

378
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,680
Think about it.

379
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,840
He revealed himself
as the Mystery Chef just for you.

380
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,400
He personally baked your birthday cake.

381
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,320
He picks you up
and drops you off every day.

382
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,440
If that's not flirting, then what is?

383
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,800
But…

384
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,880
I want him to flirt properly!

385
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,040
You know, like actual flirting.

386
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,360
I want to be wooed!

387
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,280
I don't get it, Kim.

388
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,040
We don't have to understand
everything about women.

389
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,920
Just give them what they want.

390
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,120
Like how?

391
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,880
Valentine's Day, for example.

392
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,960
Why do men have to buy flowers for women

393
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,000
when they're expensive

394
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,360
and wilt in just a few days?

395
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,960
- Yeah, true.
- But…

396
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,840
It means a lot to women.

397
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,360
What we see as something small

398
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,600
might be a huge source of happiness
for the person we love.

399
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,440
So, if she wants it, I'll just do it.

400
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,080
But before you do anything,

401
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,400
you need to know this.

402
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,000
This looks like Aunt Ratree.

403
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,640
Exactly.

404
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,120
Do Nubdao and Namfah know about this yet?

405
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
Not yet.

406
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,240
That's why I need your help.

407
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,240
Sorry I'm late.
I had to stop and pick up the flowers.

408
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,880
Flamingo flower?

409
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,160
Yes. If I'm giving flowers,
I want them to be unforgettable.

410
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,320
Still think he's not flirting?

411
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,880
Nubdao,

412
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,360
isn't that a flamingo flower?

413
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,800
You're right.

414
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,360
Thank you.

415
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,360
I chose the flamingo flower

416
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,240
because it symbolizes steadfast love,

417
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,480
patience, and unwavering devotion.

418
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,360
I won't change my heart.

419
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,360
I was teaching a crocodile how to swim.

420
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,120
Excuse me,

421
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,800
but how much longer
do you plan on playing footsie?

422
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,240
Do you two have something to say?

423
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,200
Have you ever seen this picture before?

424
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,320
That's my dad, and that's me.

425
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,080
This must be me.

426
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,760
And this woman…

427
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,000
Mom?

428
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,960
Her name is Ratree.

429
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,520
Auntie,

430
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,120
this is Nubdao, my sister.

431
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,760
Good morning.

432
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,400
You two are sisters?

433
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,600
Yes.

434
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,040
We've talked for so long,
but I still don't know your name.

435
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,200
What's your name, Auntie?

436
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,240
Ratree.

437
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,920
My name is Ratree.

438
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,040
Will I ever get to see you again,
Aunt Ratree?

439
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,920
We will definitely meet again.

440
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,400
Your mother hasn't gone anywhere.

441
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,000
She's up there,

442
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,400
on one of the stars in the sky.

443
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,240
And if you're a good girl,

444
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,160
an angel might send her back to you.

445
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,120
Mom won't come back.

446
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,840
Why do you think so?

447
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,120
Because dead people

448
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,800
don't come back.

449
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,680
Your mother isn't dead!

450
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,080
Your mother suffered so much.

451
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,680
She was framed and sent to prison.

452
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,640
When she got out,
she was too ashamed to face you.

453
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,640
She didn't know how you'd react.

454
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,840
Who framed her, Uncle Pu?

455
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,520
We don't know yet.

456
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,160
But what you should know
is that your mother was innocent.

457
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,240
Then why did everyone lie to us
and say she was dead?

458
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,120
Your mother didn't want to burden you.

459
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,120
She was afraid people would mock you
for having a mother who was in prison.

460
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,720
She was afraid
you wouldn't be able to accept it.

461
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,200
But she loves you and cares for you.

462
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,840
She wants to spend
the rest of her life with you two.

463
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,480
What do you think?

464
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,960
Uncle Pu never keeps secrets,

465
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,760
except this one.

466
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,480
All these years,

467
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,600
he must have felt so burdened.

468
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,440
He had to take care of Mom

469
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,280
while looking after us too.

470
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,120
When we were kids,

471
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,560
we were glued to him,

472
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,640
always making him carry us everywhere.

473
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,040
It must have been
a crazy life for a young man.

474
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,880
I believe

475
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,600
no one wanted to keep this a secret.

476
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,160
They were just waiting for the right time.

477
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,760
Aunt Ratree must have suffered a lot too.

478
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,800
Ever since I met Aunt Ratree,

479
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,600
I've felt warmth.

480
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,920
I could sense the love she had for me.

481
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,720
But I never had
a single memory of my mother.

482
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,840
But from now on, I will.

483
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,160
Mr. Kim,

484
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,000
can you take me somewhere?

485
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,080
Of course.

486
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,840
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.

487
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,080
Pu,

488
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,720
what did my daughters say?

489
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,920
They're still quiet about it, sis.

490
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,720
I see…

491
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,160
Do you think they'll understand me?

492
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,800
I think they will, sis.

493
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,520
Just "think"?

494
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,320
You've been with them their whole lives.

495
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,560
What do they really think of me?

496
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,040
Do they understand me or not? Tell me.

497
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,520
- Sis.
- Pu.

498
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,560
Sis.

499
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,720
I can't read their minds on this.

500
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,880
I've raised them since they were kids,

501
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,920
but I can't read their minds
on everything.

502
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,520
Oh…

503
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,960
Maybe it's my fault

504
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,000
for lying to them from the start.

505
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,360
Thanks.

506
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,240
Come on, sis.

507
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,040
Give them some time.

508
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,200
We just told them.

509
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,800
Mr. Kim, what are you doing?

510
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,240
Taking off my shirt.

511
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,560
Why? I'm at the beach. Can't I?

512
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,800
Nubdao.

513
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,760
<i>I wasn't the one who kept these pictures.</i>

514
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,880
If it's too hard for you,
we can just stay the way we are.

515
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,600
Dad lied about Mom.

516
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,600
I'm sorry, Ms. Jitree,

517
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,280
for resigning so suddenly.

518
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't have much to give you,

519
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,160
but here are my daughter's clothes.

520
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,920
You took a dead person's clothes
just to haunt me, didn't you?

521
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,560
Well, if you're dead from shock
right now, that wouldn't be so bad.

522
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,960
Get out of my house!

523
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,440
How dare you bring
cursed objects here? Leave!

524
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,920
Your next job is to find out

525
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,040
where this Ratree woman came from.

526
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,280
She seems way too close to my wife.

527
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,040
Mirantee…

528
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,560
I know you're confused right now,

529
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,720
but you don't have to rush
into a decision, Nubdao.

530
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,120
