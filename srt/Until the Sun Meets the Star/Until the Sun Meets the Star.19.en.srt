1
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,400
<i>Your father ordered me</i>
<i>to plant drugs on Mirantee.</i>

2
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,480
<i>Then he had me burn her house</i>
<i>to destroy all the evidence.</i>

3
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,920
You're disgusting!

4
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,440
Wait, Sasi, no. That's not true.

5
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,960
<i>No!</i>

6
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,320
Wee and I came to apologize
for what our father

7
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
did to your family.

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,080
What right did he have to do this to us?

9
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,640
I used to be full of anger and pain too,
but I overcame it.

10
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,880
If we keep drowning in sorrow,
we'll never be happy again.

11
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,360
- It's unforgivable--
- Let's stop talking about this.

12
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,520
I think we need some time apart.

13
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,560
Honestly, I'm not mad at Mr. Kim either.

14
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,160
Do you think I was too harsh on him?

15
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,960
Are you surprised
that Patthawee is Aran's son?

16
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Should we move out of here?

17
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,000
We don't belong here anyway.

18
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,120
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

19
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm not Dad's son.

20
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,520
That's why I think
we should move out of here.

21
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,640
About the hotel shares and the assets
we've received from Mr. Taychit,

22
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
I'd like to return all of it to you.

23
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,080
As for the vice president title,
it was never mine to begin with.

24
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
You don't need to return anything.

25
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,920
Half of this hotel belonged to Mr. Aran.

26
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,760
You have every right to run it.

27
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,040
Please keep working with me.

28
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,240
It's better if I don't.
I don't think I'm the right person.

29
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,960
Even if you're not Dad's son,

30
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,400
what can I do?

31
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
I already see you as my brother.

32
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,600
Please don't leave. Let's stay together…

33
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,440
as a family.

34
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Please…

35
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,520
Mother.

36
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,560
Great! Now I'll get to eat
delicious food made by Wee.

37
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,920
Since Kim can't cook for his life.

38
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,520
So, no moving out, okay?

39
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
Stay with us, please.

40
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
You really can't cook.

41
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,480
Where's Nubdao?

42
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,880
She already resigned, sir.

43
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,440
I've been wondering for ages
who Mr. Aran reminded me of.

44
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,440
Turns out it's you, Mr. Wee.

45
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,600
You both are warm and kind.

46
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,800
Do you think he'd be upset

47
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,320
that I've been taking care
of another man instead?

48
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,320
You've done the right thing,

49
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,400
repaying the man who raised you.

50
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,000
I believe Mr. Aran would understand.

51
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,240
And he'd be so proud of you.

52
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,960
<i>Money can't buy everything.</i>

53
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,560
That might be true…
if the money isn't enough.

54
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,640
At least it can't buy me.

55
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,640
Got it.

56
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,560
<i>Do you think I'm as warm</i>

57
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,440
<i>as the summer sun?</i>

58
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,080
I think you're more like the evening sun.

59
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,040
The sun that's about to set…

60
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,280
Doesn't that seem a bit lonely and sad?

61
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,480
<i>But I see it as the last warm light</i>

62
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,880
<i>that embraces the little stars at night.</i>

63
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,280
When the sun sets,

64
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
it's time for the stars to shine,

65
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,080
isn't it?

66
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,880
<i>All of my time belongs to you alone.</i>

67
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,200
<i>What did you wish for, Mr. Kim?</i>

68
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,240
I wished for you
to be happy every single day.

69
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,640
Starlight might not shine very bright,

70
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,160
but in a moment of darkness,

71
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,520
it can still be hope
for someone who's looking.

72
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,840
Are you looking at this star too,

73
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Nubdao?

74
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,680
Three thousand,

75
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,400
3,500, 3,600…

76
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
If we keep selling like this every day,

77
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,160
we'll have our own storefront soon!

78
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,760
Nub!

79
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Yes, Uncle Pu?

80
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,560
Did you even hear a word I said?

81
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,720
You've been zoned out forever.

82
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,600
I wasn't zoning out.

83
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,000
Wasn't zoning out?

84
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,840
Please, you've been staring off
into space for an hour.

85
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,520
So, why'd you quit your job
if you're going to be like this?

86
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
And did you tell Mr. Kim?

87
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,280
That face says no.

88
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,360
Hmm?

89
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,440
You really aren't going to tell him?

90
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,640
Oh, Nub…

91
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
Did Nubdao really quit?

92
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,040
Why does love have to be
this hard for you, Kim?

93
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,080
You want me to help talk to her?

94
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,200
No need.

95
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
She must have thought it through.

96
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,400
Even if she made up her mind,
she can always change it.

97
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,440
Right?

98
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,840
Ten… So many orders.

99
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,120
Hurry up, Uncle Pu,
or we'll miss the delivery time!

100
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,400
I know! Go help your mom in the kitchen.

101
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,200
Sheesh, we're really
selling well these days.

102
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,320
Pack them in the bags.

103
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,320
I got it. Come on.

104
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
- Here, here.
- Hurry up.

105
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,000
Whoa.

106
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,640
Take this one too, Uncle Pu.

107
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,800
Don't squish the rice.

108
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,480
Are you my niece or my mother?

109
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,160
- Hurry up, Uncle Pu!
- Bossy, aren't you?

110
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,560
The customers are waiting! Hurry up!

111
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Nubdao.

112
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,680
Ms. Tawan?

113
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Thank you.

114
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,800
Did you come to see me for something?

115
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,600
I'll ask you straight.
Do you have a problem with my brother?

116
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,480
I know what our father did
is unforgivable,

117
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,080
but what does my brother
have to do with it?

118
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,840
I understand…

119
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,640
but I still can't let go.

120
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,080
And you think we're all
feeling just fine about this?

121
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,720
If we had a choice,
no one would want this to happen.

122
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,000
Try separate things.

123
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,320
Fine.

124
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,720
Do what you want. Just don't act
like you're the only one hurting.

125
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,560
Kim can barely eat or sleep these days.

126
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,800
- Where were you, Tawan?
- I went to see Nubdao.

127
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Why did you go?

128
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,320
To tell her that what happened
with the adults has nothing to do with us.

129
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,000
Tawan,

130
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320
you shouldn't have said that.
We really are the ones at fault here.

131
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,920
But you weren't the one who did it.

132
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,280
Never mind.

133
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,800
If she doesn't want to see me
anymore, I can't force her.

134
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,760
So, you've really given up?

135
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,280
Then stop looking so miserable.
Both of you.

136
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,440
So, you've really given up?
Then stop looking so miserable.

137
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,440
<i>Both of you.</i>

138
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,400
What do you mean?

139
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,520
She doesn't look better than you.

140
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,440
So, we're both hurting the same.

141
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
Then why are we…

142
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,680
like this?

143
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,280
I'm screwed. Oh no, oh no, oh no!

144
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,560
What's wrong, Uncle Pu?

145
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,920
I missed one order.

146
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,280
Just deliver this batch, then come back.
I'll tell Mom to make it right away.

147
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,200
That won't work! This order's far.

148
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm afraid I won't make it back in time.
And I have orders from this morning too.

149
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,840
I'm so dead! What can I do?

150
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,960
She's going to kill me.

151
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,240
She's going to kill me.

152
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,560
I'll deliver the missed order for you.

153
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,840
Nubdao, my dear niece.

154
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,200
Thank you so much.
I'll send you the address now.

155
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,320
Alright.

156
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Okay.

157
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,840
Thanks, my lovely niece.

158
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay.

159
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm off. Love you.

160
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Is this really the place?

161
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,000
Did he send me the wrong address?

162
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,880
Nubdao.

163
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,920
Your order.

164
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,520
Nubdao.

165
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,320
I'm sorry for doing this.

166
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,480
But can you please hear me out?

167
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,440
I have nothing to say to you.

168
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,680
But I do. We promised
not to lie to each other, remember?

169
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,560
So, let me speak honestly.

170
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,880
My life without you is miserable, Nubdao.

171
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,480
What about you?

172
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,520
Me too.

173
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,720
Since we both aren't happy,

174
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,160
then why are we
letting things stay like this?

175
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
Please stop, Mr. Kim.

176
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,640
Don't make this any harder for me.

177
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,040
I'm so sorry.

178
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,800
Thank you.

179
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,240
This necklace…

180
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,720
My mother gave it to me
before she passed away.

181
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,240
Help.

182
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,920
Help.

183
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,640
Help.

184
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,960
Help me.

185
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,720
Help. Please help my sister.

186
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,640
What about you?

187
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
Don't worry about me.

188
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,360
Help my sister first.

189
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
I'm here to help.

190
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
Hang in there.

191
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,320
When I was a child,
I was in a car accident.

192
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,120
A boy saved me.

193
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,960
He gave me a new life.

194
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,640
Before I blacked out, I saw this necklace.

195
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,360
That boy was you, wasn't it?

196
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,240
Go back home to Grandma.

197
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,120
- Go on.
- Okay.

198
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,720
Help.

199
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,720
Help me.

200
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,920
That little girl…

201
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,840
was you?

202
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,240
Pu, did Nubdao go out for the delivery?

203
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,440
Yep.

204
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,200
Still have the nerve to smile?

205
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,360
Next time, check the orders carefully.

206
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,720
We don't want a bad review.

207
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,960
- Hey, sis.
- What?

208
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,240
I didn't forget. I did it on purpose.

209
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,120
What do you mean?

210
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,000
Kim wanted to make it up to Nub.
So, I just gave him a little helping hand.

211
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,520
You want me to trick Nub?

212
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,000
Got it.

213
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,720
I'm screwed.

214
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,280
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

215
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
What's wrong, Uncle Pu?

216
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,000
I missed one order.

217
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,440
Pu, you're unbelievable.

218
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,600
If she finds out,
she's going to be mad at you.

219
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,200
Oh come on, sis.
Why would she? I did it for her.

220
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,600
How could I stand by
and watch her mope around like that?

221
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,560
- You didn't do it for money?
- She's my dear niece.

222
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,280
Let's hope Mr. Kim's plan works.

223
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,600
I want you to keep it.

224
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,280
You kept this button?

225
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,280
I wanted the star
to always stay beside the sun.

226
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,840
You said that day I gave you a new life.

227
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,320
Today, I want you
to give me a new life too.

228
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,320
Can we start over,

229
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,520
Nubdao?

230
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,239
In the end, whatever you choose,

231
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,080
this time,

232
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,680
I'll accept your decision.

233
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,240
<i>I used to be full of anger and pain too,</i>

234
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
<i>but I overcame it.</i>

235
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,480
<i>Because I wanted to live</i>
<i>a happy life with you both again.</i>

236
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,080
What are you making for me today?

237
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,960
Truffle cheese pizza,

238
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,360
baked cheese pasta, and grilled salmon.

239
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,000
Whoa, everything's just cheese!

240
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,600
Because you love it.

241
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,360
Stop acting like you know me so well.

242
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,520
And where are you off to today?

243
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,320
I'm taking Namfah
to that café you recommended.

244
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,600
What about the other thing I said?

245
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
What thing?

246
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,440
Whoa… About asking her
to be your girlfriend!

247
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,360
Just wait a bit more.

248
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,760
If you keep waiting for Kim,
you'll never get married.

249
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,200
Hey, hey.

250
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
Uncle Pu,

251
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,080
this one too.

252
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,640
- Yeah, yeah, I got it!
- Hurry up.

253
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
- You're slow.
- All done.

254
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,360
- All done.
- You'll spill the rice again.

255
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,800
I know.

256
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,600
Hey, I'm hungry. Any food?

257
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,720
This is yours.

258
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,480
This one's for Nubdao.

259
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,160
And this is for Mom.
Don't you dare steal it.

260
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,240
I know, I know.

261
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,400
But hey, why do you look so pretty today?

262
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,800
Well, Mr. Wee's coming to pick me up.

263
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,400
Aha! No wonder you put on makeup so early.

264
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,160
Jealous, aren't you?
A single man like you wouldn't understand.

265
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,400
Ha! So you're admitting you're not single?

266
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,240
- Are you not single?
- No!

267
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,640
I mean…

268
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,240
Uncle Pu! You're just saying nonsense!

269
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,560
It's true though! You're leaving?

270
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,880
Pu, what did you say to her?
Look at her strutting off now.

271
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,240
Your daughters are annoying, both of them.

272
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,760
They are acting all hard to get.
She's just as pretty as her mom.

273
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,560
Eat your porridge before it gets cold.

274
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,120
You're almost there.
Just a little more practice.

275
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,200
I'm good with savory dishes.
This is my first time trying desserts.

276
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,360
How'd you know about this café, anyway?

277
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,320
Promtawan recommended it.

278
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,360
You're asking for advice from her now?

279
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,360
Yes.

280
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,200
<i>I want the stars</i>
<i>to always stay with the sun.</i>

281
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,200
You said that day I gave you a new life.

282
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,040
<i>Today, I want you</i>
<i>to give me a new life too.</i>

283
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,800
Can we start over, Nubdao?

284
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,960
CALLS

285
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,240
Hello?

286
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,400
Hello, Mr. Patthawee.

287
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,600
Yes?

288
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Sorry to bother you.
Do you know where Mr. Kim is?

289
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,840
He should be home today.

290
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,640
If I wanted to see him at his house,
would that be okay?

291
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,560
Sure. I'll send you the location.

292
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,760
Thank you.

293
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,160
That was Nubdao. She said
she wanted to go see Kim at home.

294
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,600
Should we sneak a peek?

295
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,400
No need for that.

296
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,080
Aunt Sasi, look.
Wee and his girl are so sweet!

297
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,760
And the other couple
still won't talk to each other.

298
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,000
Seeing how heartbroken Mr. Kim is
makes me feel so sorry for him.

299
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,520
Wee's calling.

300
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,080
Hello? You two are so sweet!

301
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,320
Tawan, Nubdao's on her way
to make up with Kim at the house.

302
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,320
Really? Then I'll go tell him right now.

303
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,560
No, wait. Let it be a surprise.

304
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,720
Oh, okay, okay.

305
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,160
Aunt Sasi!

306
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,800
Wee said Nubdao's on her way here
to make up with Kim.

307
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,120
- Where is he now?
- He should be upstairs, I think.

308
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,520
Alright.

309
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,840
Kim…

310
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,600
Kim, where are you going?

311
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,400
I'm going on a trip for a while.

312
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,320
Please take care
of the house when I'm away.

313
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,960
Why so sudden? How long will you be gone?

314
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,040
I haven't decided yet.

315
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,680
Wee will probably have a heavier workload,

316
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,880
but I've already signed
all the essential documents.

317
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,160
I'll join meetings online.

318
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,360
Well, I should get going.

319
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,840
Hold on, Kim! You can't just leave.

320
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,400
Did you even buy a ticket?

321
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,720
Of course, I did.

322
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,080
- Maybe you could go another day?
- Yeah.

323
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,160
I can't. I have to go today.

324
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,000
Then, let me come with you.
Just wait a sec.

325
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,480
Tawan, Tawan,
if I wait for you, I'll miss my flight.

326
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,040
Then I'll just take my passport!

327
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,800
Come here.

328
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,000
Don't worry about me.
I'll bring you something nice.

329
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,520
Mother, if there's anything you want,
message me, okay?

330
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,560
Did you tell Nubdao yet?

331
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,400
She probably doesn't want to know.

332
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,960
Will you put it on for me?

333
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,280
I never imagined

334
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,800
the person who saved my life

335
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,200
would be so close, all this time.

336
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,760
I've always wanted to find you

337
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,680
just to say…

338
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,960
thank you.

339
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,920
Thank you for saving me and my sister.

340
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,520
Thank you so much.

341
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,200
Do you think they made up
with each other yet?

342
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,480
Should we call them?

343
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,720
Let's not. Let's talk about us instead.

344
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,080
About what?

345
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,680
Since I don't have to hide
the page anymore,

346
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,280
should I show my face on it?

347
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,880
Sure.

348
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,960
And maybe rename it to…

349
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,800
Eat Together?

350
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,400
Will you film with me?

351
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,720
What if people get the wrong idea?

352
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,880
They won't.

353
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,800
Look, you've been so busy helping me,
you haven't decorated your own cake yet.

354
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,000
Actually, I've finished it.

355
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,120
WILL YOU BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

356
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,760
Will you be my girlfriend?

357
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,000
Thank you…

358
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,360
for forgiving me.

359
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,040
I was a fool. I hurt your heart,

360
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,520
and my own,

361
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,560
when happiness
was right there in front of me.

362
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,800
My mother once said

363
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,880
the reason she overcame
all her pain was because

364
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,360
she wanted to live a happy life with us.

365
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,160
Now,

366
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,920
I want to live a happy life with you.

367
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,720
- How cute!
- Look at Namfah's cheeks.

368
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,720
They're making eyes at each other!

369
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,160
That's my daughter.

370
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,920
You're looking at that again.

371
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,960
Next time, we should go with Promtawan.

372
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,520
I'm fine.

373
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,760
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon

374
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,520
Hello, dear.

375
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,160
Wow.

376
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,000
- Have you all been waiting long?
- We just got here.

377
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,040
Why so late? I'm starving over here.

378
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,320
I'm so sorry, the traffic was terrible.

379
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,160
It's alright, sweetheart. Let's eat.

380
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,400
Promtawan's just teasing.

381
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,080
I'm actually starving.

382
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,720
Alright.

383
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,640
Come on. Let's eat.

384
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,560
Look at this.

385
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,360
What is this?

386
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,800
What are you looking at?

387
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,840
The "Eat Together" page.
The chef is so handsome!

388
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,080
And you, Namfah, not bad at all.

389
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,720
You look like a K-drama lead in that clip.

390
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,800
- Mom…
- My girl is so pretty.

391
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,920
Like I'm watching a K-drama.

392
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
How many times have you watched it
since you got here?

393
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,320
Eight times.

394
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,480
And that's not counting last night, right?

395
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,680
It's like we live under the same roof.

396
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,960
I watched it last night too
and shared it with all my friends.

397
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,120
Thank you.

398
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,320
Thank you.

399
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,160
- Let's eat, shall we?
- Yes, let's.

400
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,680
Alright.

401
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,320
Well,

402
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,040
what about Nubdao and Mr. Kim?

403
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,200
- There they are.
- Good afternoon.

404
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,840
Hello.

405
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,400
Oh.

406
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,560
Sorry, we're late.

407
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,800
It's alright.

408
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,240
- Shall we eat?
- Yes.

409
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,160
Let's eat.

410
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,200
- This looks good.
- Let's eat first,

411
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,400
Ms. Sasi.

412
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,800
Yes.

413
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,160
Thank you.

414
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,400
For you.

415
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,520
Thank you.

416
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,040
- It's good, right?
- Eat more.

417
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,800
- It's your favorite.
- Thank you.

418
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,480
I'm really happy

419
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,560
to have a moment like this.

420
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,120
Finally, we're all eating together.

421
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Yes.

422
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,400
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

423
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,600
Let me get this for you.

424
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,320
Do you want me to get it for you?

425
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,600
That one.

426
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,680
Won't you eat?

427
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,960
Is it good?

428
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,160
This fried long bean is good.

429
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,720
Thank you.

430
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,480
Thank you for forgiving me,

431
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,200
even though I hurt your heart so badly.

432
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,760
Mr. Kim!

433
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,680
Before,

434
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,520
I used to hate the night.

435
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,760
It was always dark and lonely.

436
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,520
The sky is never completely dark.

437
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,160
When the sun sets,

438
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,400
there will always be stars shining.

439
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,600
But before,

440
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,040
I never saw those stars.

441
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,360
But tonight, I finally see them.

442
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,880
Nubdao,

443
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,240
please be the light in my life…

444
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,520
forever.

445
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,440
And you…

446
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,760
please be the warmth in mine,

447
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,280
forever.

448
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:37,720
THE END

449
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,080
