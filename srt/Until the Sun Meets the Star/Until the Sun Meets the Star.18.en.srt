1
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,320
<i>This is amazing, Mr. Wee.</i>

2
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,640
Glad you like it too.

3
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,880
Like it too? Like who?

4
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Promtawan.

5
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,680
She had some earlier.

6
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,480
How far do I have to run
to finally escape all of you?

7
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
You don't have to run anymore.

8
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,760
How can I trust you?

9
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,600
I want to get away from him too.

10
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,840
So, you went to work in my house because…

11
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,000
I needed evidence.

12
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,400
My father was involved
in Mr. Aran's death?

13
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,080
Yes.

14
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,520
<i>Were you able to reach Yos?</i>

15
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
Not yet.

16
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,160
But I got his address.

17
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,040
Let me come with you.

18
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,760
I might be able to help.

19
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,240
This is something
very important to my life.

20
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,160
Please keep it safe for me.

21
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,160
<i>Don't let anyone take it.</i>

22
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
Who are you looking for?

23
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Is Yos home?

24
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,680
Who are you? A friend of Yos?

25
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,880
Where is Yos?

26
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,920
Didn't you hear what I asked?
Where is Yos?!

27
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,480
I don't know.

28
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
You don't know?

29
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,360
Huh?!

30
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,040
Are you going to tell me or not?
Where the hell is Yos?!

31
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,960
Damn it!

32
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,200
Are you sure this is the place, Kim?

33
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,840
Yeah.

34
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
- Damn it!
- Hey!

35
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,480
Mr. Kimhan, Mr. Patthawee.

36
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,680
It's okay now.

37
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Did my father send you?

38
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
Hey!

39
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,640
Yos!

40
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
My son…

41
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,720
Thank you.

42
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,920
Mom…

43
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,880
Are you hurt?

44
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,640
- Are you okay, son?
- I'm fine.

45
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,760
I found Yos, Mother.

46
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,280
Kim's talking to him now.

47
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,920
I'll let you know if we learn anything.

48
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,280
Mhm.

49
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,520
Thank you, both of you,

50
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,640
for helping us.

51
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
It's alright.

52
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,880
Please, get some rest.

53
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,080
Mr. Kim…

54
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,200
Mirantee is Ratree.

55
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
If you want to know the truth,

56
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll tell you.

57
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,320
Your father

58
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
ordered me to plant drugs on Mirantee.

59
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,240
Then he had me burn her house
to destroy all the evidence.

60
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,520
And when she got out of prison,

61
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,960
he told me to kill her.

62
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
Why would he do that?

63
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,120
Because Mr. Taychit believed that

64
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
Mr. Aran had hidden evidence

65
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,280
of his embezzlement with Mirantee.

66
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
He wanted to destroy her credibility

67
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,320
so she couldn't testify for Mr. Aran.

68
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
Mr. Aran…

69
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,680
The answer is in here.

70
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,320
You won't betray me, will you?

71
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Never.

72
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
I promise you.

73
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,280
If anything happens to me,

74
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
please take care of my mother.

75
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,120
I will.

76
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
You have my word.

77
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,320
<i>I told you, didn't I?</i>
<i>Stay out of my business.</i>

78
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,120
<i>I just don't want you</i>
<i>to sink deeper into this.</i>

79
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,520
<i>By exposing me?</i>

80
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Where are all the documents?
Give them to me.

81
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I can't.

82
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,160
But if you promise to stop,

83
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,440
I'll destroy them myself.

84
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,240
Is this how you want it?

85
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
Yos.

86
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,440
Hey.

87
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
Do you really have to go this far?

88
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
You left me no choice.

89
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,120
Taychit,
it's not too late to fix yourself.

90
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,320
It's far too late.

91
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,640
Without you,

92
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,760
everything will be mine.

93
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,440
"<i>Keep it safe, Mirantee.</i>"

94
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
What did you leave with her?

95
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,440
What does Mirantee have to do with this?

96
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,360
It was just documentation
for the food department.

97
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
Yos.

98
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,160
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

99
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
Hold this.

100
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,120
This is your last chance, old friend.
Tell me!

101
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,960
Fine.

102
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,000
Are you going to tell me or not?

103
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
No…

104
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,920
When I staged it to make it look
like Mr. Aran committed suicide…

105
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,600
<i>I found a video</i>
<i>that Mr. Aran secretly recorded.</i>

106
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,160
<i>So, I kept it as insurance.</i>

107
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,680
<i>I didn't trust your father.</i>

108
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,520
So…

109
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,160
Where are you two staying tonight?

110
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,720
You're welcome to stay here.

111
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
It's alright. I'm planning
to head back to Bangkok.

112
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,440
Mr. Wee hasn't said a word.
I don't know how he's doing.

113
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,400
I'm calling him.

114
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Not yet. He might still be busy.

115
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,280
It hasn't even been 24 hours yet.

116
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,680
You miss him already?

117
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,640
I just… I'm just worried about him.

118
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
Don't you worry about Mr. Kim?

119
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,560
- Of course I do.
- Then I'm calling him.

120
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,640
NAMFAH

121
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,560
Hey, Namfah.

122
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,200
Hello, Mr. Wee. How are you both doing?

123
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,640
Everything's done.
We're heading back to Bangkok.

124
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,320
Hang on.

125
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,120
Hello, Namfah.

126
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,440
Yes, she's here.

127
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,600
It's Mr. Kim.

128
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,120
Okay.

129
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Yes, Mr. Kim?

130
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,920
Don't worry.

131
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,440
I'll…

132
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,600
I'll call you once I'm back in Bangkok.

133
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
Alright.

134
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,240
Please travel safely.

135
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,840
I will.

136
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,680
Oh, Sasi?

137
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,640
What are you doing there?

138
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,760
Were you waiting for me?

139
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,280
You're cruel,

140
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,520
selfish. You've lied to me all along.

141
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,120
You destroyed my life!
Why did you do all of this?

142
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,240
Wait, Sasi. What's going on with you?

143
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
Why did you kill Aran?

144
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,200
That's ridiculous.

145
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,960
Where are you getting this from?
Who told you?

146
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,840
<i>Are you going to tell me or not?</i>

147
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,080
Nonsense.

148
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,480
That video could've been edited.
Why would I kill my own friend?

149
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,880
Just stop lying.

150
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,720
Sasi…

151
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
You have to believe me. I love you.

152
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,840
If you really love me, turn yourself in.

153
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,840
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why would I turn myself in?

154
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,120
You… You're disgusting!

155
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,440
Let me tell you this.

156
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,920
I have never loved you.
Not even for a second.

157
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,640
Wait, Sasi, no. That's not true.

158
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,120
You love me.
We've been together for so long.

159
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,080
I love you. You must love me too.

160
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,240
You must love me too!

161
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
- I don't!
- You have to love me!

162
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,560
No!

163
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,360
Mom…

164
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,360
In the end,

166
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,640
I couldn't keep my promise.

167
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm leaving you alone again.

168
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,000
But…

169
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,200
don't worry.

170
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,560
I've asked Mr. Kim
to take care of you in my place.

171
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,480
I have to go make amends
for what I've done.

172
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,160
Take care of yourself, son.

173
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,160
I love you, Mom.

174
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,920
I love you too.

175
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,480
Goodbye, Mom.

176
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,920
Please take good care of yourself.

177
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,800
Let's go.

178
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
Mr. Wee, Mr. Kim!

179
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,480
Hey.

180
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,160
Wee and I came to apologize

181
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,040
for what our father

182
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,760
did to your family.

183
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,320
I can't look at someone
who destroyed our family.

184
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,520
Nubdao…

185
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,480
That man has already paid for what he did.

186
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,160
And the truth has come out
that I was innocent.

187
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,680
Just having the chance to be together
as a family again is enough for me.

188
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,560
But I still can't forgive him.

189
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,240
What right did he have to do this to us?

190
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,160
I used to be full of anger and pain too.

191
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,880
But I overcame it

192
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,360
because I wanted to live
a happy life with you both again.

193
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,080
My mom already let go of this.

194
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,280
And you?

195
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,320
It's not like I'm unaffected by it all.

196
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,120
But I feel the same as my mom.

197
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,000
If we keep drowning in sorrow,

198
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
we'll never be happy again.

199
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
Getting my mom back,

200
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,840
proving she was innocent,

201
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,400
that's all the happiness I need.

202
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,200
From now on, my family

203
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,040
will finally live happily together.

204
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,600
And in that happiness,
is there a place for me?

205
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,520
I know what my father did was wrong.

206
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,840
He had no right to do that to my family.

207
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,880
Even if he…

208
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,680
I can't forgive him.

209
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,360
I understand.

210
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,120
There was a time I resented him deeply
for how he treated my mom.

211
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,280
- It's unforgivable--
- Let's stop talking about this.

212
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,440
I think we need some time apart, Mr. Kim.

213
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,600
ONE MONTH LATER

214
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,040
He just fell asleep.

215
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
He's had his post-meal meds?

216
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,360
Yes, already.

217
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,480
Go eat, then. Don't you have a meeting?

218
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,040
What about you?

219
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,960
I'll join you soon.

220
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,680
It's alright. I can wait.

221
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,640
How's Dad today?

222
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,640
Same as always.

223
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,920
You've been asking everyone
for a month now, Kim.

224
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,520
If you care, just go see him.

225
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,920
Let him see your face, at least.

226
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,320
Better not.

227
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,400
When will you stop being mad at him?

228
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,280
I'm not mad.

229
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,520
I just think…

230
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,520
Dad probably doesn't want to see me.

231
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,000
His mental state's already fragile.

232
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,640
I don't want to make things worse.

233
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,000
If you keep bringing me
delicious food every day,

234
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,400
I'm definitely going to gain weight.

235
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,800
You won't.

236
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The pork is plant-based. And the sauce…

237
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,840
I made it from passion fruit.
Super healthy.

238
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,120
Where do you even
find the time to do this?

239
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,720
Aren't you managing
the business now in Mr. Taychit's place?

240
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,360
I'll always make time for you.

241
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,200
Try it.

242
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,679
It's really good!

243
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,600
Can you teach me how to make it?

244
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,320
Of course.

245
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,080
Since you like this one,

246
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,880
I'll have to tweak my recipes often
so you won't get bored of the cook.

247
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,400
I'll never get bored of you.

248
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,880
You'll never get bored…

249
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,040
But will you ever love me?

250
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,960
So, what is it, Kim?

251
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,920
You're just going
to let it stay like this?

252
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,560
Why not try winning Nubdao back?
Maybe she'll come around.

253
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,680
She won't change her mind so easily.

254
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,560
But shouldn't you at least try?

255
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,320
I want to give her some more time.

256
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,880
So, basically, you're just going to wait
for her to realize it on her own?

257
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,720
Even if it takes a lifetime, you'll wait?

258
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,680
I tried making shrimp paste rice tonight.

259
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,160
Tomorrow I'll cook it for you, okay?

260
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Okay, see you.

261
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,040
- Were you talking to Mr. Wee?
- Yes.

262
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,680
I'm not mad at Mr. Wee, Nubdao.

263
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,520
I don't think

264
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,000
he ever wanted things
to turn out this way either.

265
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,120
Honestly, I'm not mad at Mr. Kim either.

266
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,360
But every time I see his face,

267
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,520
I can't stop thinking about
what his father did to our family.

268
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,160
Do you think I was too harsh on him?

269
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,240
No, not at all.

270
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,040
I understand how you feel.

271
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,080
And I'm sure…

272
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,800
if Mr. Kim knew what's in your heart,
he'd understand too.

273
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,360
If you care, just go see him.

274
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,800
Let him see your face, at least.

275
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,880
Kim.

276
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
Kim.

277
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,440
Alright.

278
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Here's the basil!

279
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,480
Pu!

280
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,400
I told you to pick Thai basil,

281
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,920
not holy basil! What's wrong with you?

282
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,360
Come on, sis…

283
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,960
It's the same thing.

284
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,800
Uncle Pu, it's not the same!

285
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Thai basil has smooth leaves,
and there's no fuzz underneath.

286
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,640
Look here, Uncle Pu.

287
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,000
Look.

288
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,360
This is holy basil.

289
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
See? The leaves are jagged.

290
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,200
Go pick the right one.

291
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,640
What is it?

292
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,920
This is just a home kitchen,
not some five-star hotel!

293
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,640
Even if it's at home,
I still have standards!

294
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,600
Exactly. The first days matter the most.

295
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,160
We've gotta win customers over right away.

296
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,120
- Got it?
- You got that?

297
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah…

298
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,600
I make one tiny mistake
and get roasted by both of you.

299
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Keep that up
and you're not getting a share, Pu!

300
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,040
Aw, sis.

301
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,800
I'm your helper and your delivery man.

302
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,000
I get overwhelmed sometimes.
Please don't mind me.

303
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,240
My dear brother. What a talker.

304
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,160
Mom, if you need more people, let me help.

305
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,280
Hey, Nub. How are you gonna help
when you've already got a full-time job?

306
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Don't try to sneak in on my cut, alright?

307
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,360
Mom, Uncle Pu…

308
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,200
I already quit my job.

309
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,160
Did you really quit?

310
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,720
Yes.

311
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,040
Nubdao submitted
her resignation last month.

312
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,440
You knew this all along, Namfah?

313
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,880
I asked Namfah not to say anything.
I wanted to tell you myself.

314
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,800
And why did you quit?

315
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm not happy with my job.

316
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,760
You're not happy with your job,
or with someone?

317
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,360
Nubdao, sweetheart.

318
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,160
I understand.

319
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,440
Just accepting their apology
is already more than enough.

320
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,560
When you're ready,
forgiveness will come in its own time.

321
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,720
Yes, Mom.

322
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,000
All done, Dad.

323
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,360
I know what's happening to you right now

324
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,760
is worse than prison.

325
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,120
But everything that's happened

326
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,680
is the result of your own doing.

327
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,280
How does it feel

328
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,560
that Patthawee,

329
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,480
the son of the man you murdered,

330
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,760
is taking good care of you?

331
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,280
Are you surprised

332
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,000
that Patthawee is Aran's son?

333
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,640
I kept that from you

334
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,080
because I knew you loved him.

335
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,520
But if I told him,

336
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,920
it wouldn't be too late, would it?

337
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,080
But I won't tell him.

338
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,560
I pity my son.

339
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,840
Back then,

340
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,280
your father and I were in love.

341
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
We were deeply in love.

342
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,160
Your father was a good man.

343
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,320
I thought he died of heart failure.

344
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,400
After that,

345
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,760
Taychit took care of me,

346
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,200
and I found out

347
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,560
I was pregnant with you.

348
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,280
So, I let things go the way they did.

349
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,200
I'm sorry…

350
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,840
for being selfish,

351
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,280
for letting you grow up
being called the son of a mistress.

352
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,880
I'm sorry…

353
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,640
for letting you carry the name of the man

354
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,440
who killed your real father.

355
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,480
If this hadn't happened,

356
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,480
I wouldn't have learned the truth,
would I?

357
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,080
Why did you let everyone here
trample on your dignity?

358
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,240
Why did you carry it all alone?

359
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,600
Was it all for me?

360
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,320
From now on,

361
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,880
let me share the burden with you.

362
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,600
I'm so sorry, my son…

363
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,920
Hurry up and deliver these.

364
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,080
Don't make any stops.
The customers will be waiting.

365
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,160
Got it, sis.

366
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,080
Wow. We're this busy on day one?

367
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,160
That's a good thing, isn't it?

368
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,920
Alright.

369
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,280
It smells so good.
I want to eat it myself!

370
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,800
You want to eat everything.

371
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,560
Sis!

372
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,480
And bring back the full payment.
No skimming!

373
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,600
Don't worry, sis.

374
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,400
This is the new Pu now.

375
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,080
- Go!
- Alright. I'm going.

376
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,160
What happened, Tawan?

377
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,360
I dropped it. The whole floor's wet now.

378
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,280
I'll get someone to clean it up.

379
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,680
It's okay, I'll do it.
Can you stay with Dad for a bit?

380
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,400
Please.

381
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,600
To be honest,

382
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,320
I'm so angry with you.

383
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,680
I've always told you

384
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,120
about Mom

385
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,280
and about me and my sister.

386
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,880
But…

387
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,360
I've moved past it now.

388
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,040
The reason I didn't come in

389
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,960
was because I thought
you wouldn't want to see me.

390
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,760
And I was afraid that if I did,

391
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,160
I'd just upset you.

392
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,440
When I used to cry as a kid,

393
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,760
I always wished
you'd wipe my tears away like this.

394
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,040
We've never really had
a proper conversation, have we?

395
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Maybe this is the first.

396
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,840
Whether you believe me or not,

397
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,440
I just want you to know…

398
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,800
I love you, Dad.

399
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,400
I've always loved you.

400
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,920
I made rice porridge this morning.

401
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,480
Mom.

402
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,080
Should we move out of here?

403
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,400
We don't have anything to do
with the people in it anymore.

404
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,400
Why would you say that?

405
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,440
Kim…

406
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,600
I'm not Dad's son.

407
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,640
So, Nubdao really did quit, Kim?

408
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,400
She must've thought it through.

409
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,400
Alright.

410
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Nubdao…

411
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,920
Fine.

412
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,200
Do what you want. It's your life.

413
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,120
Will you be my girlfriend?

414
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,040
Where's Nubdao?

415
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,480
<i>She already quit, sir.</i>

416
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,760
Why the hell did you quit?
If this is what quitting looks like?

417
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,840
If neither of us is happy,

418
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,280
why let it stay this way, Nubdao?

419
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,640
Please stop, Mr. Kim.

420
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,200
Don't make this any harder for me.

421
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,480
I'll respect your decision.

422
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,080
