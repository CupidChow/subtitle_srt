1
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,280
What happened?

2
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,920
The guest believes
Duangporn stole her diamond earring.

3
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,240
<i>Got it.</i>

4
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>I'm wondering what's so special about you.</i>

5
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,320
You've been here two days,
and Mr. Kimhan and Mr. Pathawee

6
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,720
are already fighting over you.

7
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,960
You must make a decision, Nubdao.

8
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,960
I'll remind you.

9
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,400
Your decision today is final.

10
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,040
There will be no changing your mind.

11
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,480
Didn't expect you to turn down
a personal assistant job for this.

12
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,120
But I prefer working in the front office.

13
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,360
So, you like fixing
other people's problems?

14
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,000
You could say that.

15
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,040
My father might not get over

16
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,640
watching his best friend
shoot himself right in front of him…

17
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,760
So, between young Mr. Aran and me,

18
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,240
who's more handsome?

19
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,800
It's just a statue,

20
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,840
but everyone's acting
like it's life or death.

21
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,000
If Ms. Sasi hadn't intervened,

22
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,600
Mr. Aran's statue
would've been destroyed by now.

23
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,600
- Ms. Sanguansri.
- Yes?

24
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,000
Was my father
really that close with Mr. Aran?

25
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,800
Of course.

26
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,800
They co-founded this hotel together.

27
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,320
But back then, the hotel
was in a severe financial crisis.

28
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,959
Mr. Aran couldn't take it anymore,
so he took his own life.

29
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
The chairman had to carry
the burden of saving the company alone.

30
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,640
And he managed to pull through.

31
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,080
But that statue…
It's probably a painful reminder for him.

32
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,960
Ms. Sanguansri, tell Nubdao not to get
too close to Pathawee.

33
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't like it.

34
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,760
I don't like employees
getting too close with executives.

35
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
I absolutely hate those

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
who suck up to their bosses.

37
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,880
I'll make sure to warn Nubdao.

38
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,200
I'll also tell her

39
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
to keep her distance from you as well.

40
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,000
No need.

41
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,800
I know how to handle employees. I know.

42
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
First, he wants me to stop her.

43
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Then he doesn't. What does he want?

44
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,040
This is giving me a headache.

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,160
How is your brother doing?
Have you spoken to him?

46
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,600
Lately, Kim has been heading
to the hotel early every day.

47
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,920
I think he doesn't trust
Pathawee and his mother.

48
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Keep an eye on them.

49
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,200
Don't let them funnel
all the assets into their pockets.

50
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
No matter what,

51
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,360
those things belong
to you and your brother,

52
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,880
not those two parasites. Remember that.

53
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,920
But Dad always says the hotel was built
with his blood, sweat, and tears.

54
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,520
Twenty-five years ago,

55
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,200
when that hotel
was on the verge of bankruptcy,

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,680
wasn't I the one who bailed it out?

57
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,000
I sold off our land, our cattle.

58
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,800
I sacrificed everything just to save it.

59
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,120
If it weren't for me, your father
wouldn't have anything today.

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Don't make me bring it up again.

61
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,760
If Kim finds out about this,
he won't let it slide.

62
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
Exactly.

63
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
So, how do we make sure he finds out?

64
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,040
Now, I must go pray.

65
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,520
Alright.

66
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,320
O divine forces,

67
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,200
by the merit I have accumulated

68
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,200
in this life and the lives before,

69
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,160
I beseech you…

70
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,480
Let Taychit, Sasi,

71
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
and their wretched son Pathawee suffer.

72
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,480
Let them know pain, misery,

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,160
and despair.

74
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,400
Let them die pitiful, wretched deaths,

75
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,560
worse than stray dogs in the streets,

76
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,360
for what they did to Jitsuda.

77
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,560
Let my prayers be answered.

78
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,880
<i>Many people end up in tears</i>
<i>when chopping onions.</i>

79
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
<i>Here's a simple fix.</i>

80
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,400
<i>Chewing gum or sucking on a candy</i>
<i>while slicing onions</i>

81
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,800
<i>will help reduce irritation.</i>

82
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,280
<i>Since breathing through your mouth</i>

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,720
<i>absorbs the sulfur compounds first,</i>

84
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,640
<i>they won't reach your eyes.</i>

85
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,120
<i>This way, you won't end up in tears</i>
<i>while chopping onions.</i>

86
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,360
You know this chef?

87
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,840
I've followed his page since he had
a hundred followers. Now he has millions.

88
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,720
But no one's ever seen his face.

89
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,280
Mysterious, huh?

90
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,400
I bet he's hot, like a K-drama actor!

91
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,440
What if he's just a shy, nerdy guy
who doesn't want anyone to know?

92
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,600
Doesn't matter.
One day, I'll find out who he is.

93
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,280
I'm starving!

94
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Namfah, Nubdao, what's for dinner?

95
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,640
I haven't eaten all day.

96
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,520
Eat your "special menu" instead.

97
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Poker chips, betting slips,
and gambling debts.

98
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,000
Stuff yourself with that instead of food!

99
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,520
You've spent all the money gambling.

100
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,440
Come on. When will you stop saying this?

101
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,800
I work all day delivering stuff.

102
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,680
A little gambling
to spice up life isn't a crime.

103
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,160
Hey!

104
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Where's the food?

105
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
Right there.

106
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,560
Where?

107
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,040
That's your snack. Eat up!

108
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,160
Namfah, you little devil!

109
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
Namfah.

110
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm hungry!

111
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,800
We have eggs, onions, and potatoes.

112
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,920
What should we do?

113
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
I have an idea.

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,720
It looks weird. What kind of food is this?

115
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,120
You're weird too!

116
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,360
No name. It's my first time cooking this.

117
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,320
First time?

118
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,640
Wait. So, I'm your test subject?

119
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,760
Are you eating it or not?
If not, I'll eat it myself.

120
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Wait. I'll eat it.

121
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,960
So sensitive.

122
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,760
Let's try.

123
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,640
This is delicious!

124
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,640
It's not bad at all.

125
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Slow down. No one's taking it from you.

126
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,040
Oh, wow.

127
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,760
If you go on <i>Mawin Fin Furr</i>,
you'll be a huge hit and get filthy rich!

128
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,480
That's a famous show.

129
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,200
- It is!
- It's top-notch.

130
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,320
You'll get rich.

131
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,280
This is the first time you've ever said
something I actually agree with.

132
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,200
Come in.

133
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,240
This is the Executive Summary.

134
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,800
You don't have to go through
all these documents.

135
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,800
Just read the Executive Summary.

136
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,520
I've summarized everything for you
and highlighted the key points

137
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
you need for tomorrow's meeting.

138
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,800
Thanks a lot.

139
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,560
I was drowning in paperwork.

140
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,720
I don't even know
if I'll finish reading all this.

141
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,320
Here.

142
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,200
Thank you.

143
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,880
Tomorrow's meeting

144
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,920
is about hiring new staff
for various departments,

145
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,680
but I'm sure Mr. Kimhan will oppose it,

146
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
especially
for the Food and Beverage department.

147
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,000
Food is one of our hotel's selling points,

148
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,320
and the monthly revenue is substantial.

149
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
Why would my brother oppose it?

150
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
Revenue is high,
but that doesn't mean it's profitable.

151
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,960
The Food and Beverage department
has high revenue

152
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,800
but consistently incurs losses

153
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,080
due to an inefficient procurement system

154
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,040
and lack of cost control,

155
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,960
leading to excessive expenditure.

156
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,080
So, even if we reduce staff,

157
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,120
it won't solve the root problem?

158
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,840
Exactly.

159
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,200
Until the financial management issues
are resolved.

160
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,520
But… will Kim agree?

161
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,120
He may seem stubborn,
but when it comes to work,

162
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
strong reasoning can change his mind.

163
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,600
Trust me.

164
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
Don't stay up too late.

165
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,520
You need to be well-rested

166
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,520
for tomorrow's battle.

167
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,840
Hello. Who is this?

168
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,320
It's me, Nubdao.

169
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,920
Mr. Kimhan?

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
Did you think it was a scam call?

171
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,640
How can I help you?

172
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,480
I have a meeting at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

173
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,960
I want you to bring my coffee
to the main conference room.

174
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
Sure,

175
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,960
I'll inform the café staff.

176
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,880
I called you, so you're the one
who should take care of it, Nubdao.

177
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,360
What?

178
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,400
I want lungo coffee, ten grams of coffee

179
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,160
per 24-gram shot,

180
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,880
extracted in approximately 35 seconds.

181
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,600
A 120 ml espresso shot

182
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,000
with cream on top,

183
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
slightly bitter with a bit
of astringency, not too full-bodied.

184
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
That's all.

185
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,480
I hope your coffee doesn't disappoint me.

186
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,960
I'll do my best.

187
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,200
See you tomorrow.

188
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,520
I don't agree with hiring
more staff at this time.

189
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,560
ANNUAL REPORT

190
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Especially
in the Food and Beverage department.

191
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,960
But our department needs more staff.

192
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,600
We've had an increase in restaurant guests
since the beginning of the year.

193
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,200
Your department is in the red every month.

194
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,880
Your expenses exceed
your revenue almost every month.

195
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,960
If we add more staff,
it will only increase costs.

196
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,680
And honestly, the number
of employees we already have

197
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,600
is excessive.

198
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Our Food and Beverage department

199
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,160
has consistently generated high sales,

200
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,440
but its losses stem
from financial mismanagement.

201
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,960
Cutting staff won't help.

202
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
It could even compromise quality.

203
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,960
Interesting.

204
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,920
I think we should address the root cause

205
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,960
by implementing better financial controls.

206
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,960
Fine. I'll let you handle it.

207
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm sure everyone is eager to see
how our new vice president performs.

208
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,560
Right, everyone?

209
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,040
Excuse me.

210
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,280
Nubdao!

211
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,160
We're in the middle of a meeting.

212
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,360
- Who gave you permission to come in?
- I did.

213
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,480
Alright, that's it for today.

214
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
You're dismissed.

215
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,120
Lungo coffee,

216
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,240
10 grams of coffee per 24-gram shot,

217
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,720
extracted for 35 seconds,

218
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,000
topped with a 120 ml espresso shot

219
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,120
with a fine crema layer,

220
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,880
slightly bitter
with a hint of astringency,

221
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,520
body not too heavy, just as you requested.

222
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,960
Do you know the difference
between lungo and Americano?

223
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,840
Lungo is brewed
by extracting coffee into hot water,

224
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,200
while Americano is made
by adding hot water to espresso.

225
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,840
Not bad.

226
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,520
Have you worked as a barista before?

227
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,080
No, I just listened to a podcast.

228
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,920
Let's see if it's drinkable.

229
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,160
Let's try.

230
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,040
How is it?
This is my first time making it.

231
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Good--

232
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,560
I mean, not bad. It's drinkable.

233
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,840
Well, if there's nothing else,
I'll get back to work.

234
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,640
Are you free after work today?

235
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,920
I need to discuss something important.

236
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,840
You were right. Strong reasoning
did change my brother's mind.

237
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,440
I was just speaking from experience.

238
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,240
Most executives
believe in data-driven decisions.

239
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,800
If you hadn't said anything,
I'd have thought you could read his mind.

240
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,040
No one can predict
what Mr. Kimhan is thinking.

241
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,560
That's true. Even I can't read him.

242
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,680
But today's meeting
went smoothly because of you.

243
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,800
No wonder.

244
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,560
You're this good.

245
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,600
That's why my father
assigned you to assist me.

246
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,360
This year, we're only allowed
to hire one Kitchen Helper.

247
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,160
- Just one?
- Yes.

248
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,840
One?

249
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,520
That's ridiculous.

250
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,880
We've been running around
with no time to breathe.

251
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,920
We should at least hire two more.

252
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,920
Hey, at least we're not facing layoffs.

253
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,520
I don't want to be unemployed.

254
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,040
Being broke is way scarier.

255
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,960
Well, this is the policy.
We have to follow it.

256
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,360
That means this year's selection process

257
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,080
will be tough.

258
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,360
Both a written test and a practical exam.

259
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,000
It's so hard.

260
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,320
It's like taking
a university entrance exam.

261
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,840
Who's writing the exam?

262
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,640
You, Maiaek?

263
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,120
Hey, I'm more of a hands-on guy.

264
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Not great with theory.

265
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,840
Not me.

266
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,640
If you're not doing it, then who?

267
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,880
Yeah.

268
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,280
I am.

269
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,240
Mr. Pathawee?

270
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,080
I'll write the test myself.

271
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,680
Go ahead and eat.

272
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,960
Soup tastes best when it's hot.

273
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,080
You called me here
for something important. What is it?

274
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,800
I forgot.

275
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,320
- Just eat.
- Then, I'll take my leave.

276
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,800
Wait.

277
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,120
Sit down.

278
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,120
Yesterday, I saw you talking to Wee alone.

279
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,560
What was that about?

280
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,120
- I can't say it.
- Why not?

281
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,520
Because you ordered me not to.

282
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,760
What did I order?

283
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,160
You told me never to talk
about our superiors behind their backs,

284
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,960
good or bad.

285
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Are you mocking me?

286
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,400
Not at all.

287
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,560
You asked, so I answered.

288
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,760
I said I wouldn't do it, and I won't.

289
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,560
But you broke my rule
by speaking to Wee alone.

290
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,960
I believe that's not a rule.
It's neither policy nor regulation.

291
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,440
If it's my order, then it's a rule.

292
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,440
Understood.

293
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,520
I'll remember that.

294
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,240
Is there anything else that's "important"?

295
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,320
No.

296
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,120
Then I won't keep bothering you.

297
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,760
Enjoy your soup

298
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,800
while it's still hot.

299
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,160
Nubdao, right?

300
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,560
Oh, it's you.

301
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,120
I'm Yada, Mr. Pathawee's secretary.

302
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,480
Nice to meet you.

303
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,800
Likewise. Nice to meet you too.

304
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,520
Are you dating Mr. Kim?

305
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,560
No, he's just my boss.
We're not involved in any way.

306
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,800
Not involved?

307
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,200
But you two were having dinner together.

308
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,720
Even a sixth-grader

309
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,200
could tell something's going on.

310
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,040
It's not what you think, I assure you.

311
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,160
If you still don't believe me,

312
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,360
you can ask Mr. Kimhan yourself.

313
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,320
Mind if I join you?

314
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,760
That was your doing, wasn't it?

315
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,360
What are you talking about?

316
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,360
The meeting this morning.

317
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,400
I could see that idea was from you.

318
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,400
It could've been Mr. Wee's plan.

319
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,320
Wee? He's an idiot.

320
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,280
He could never come up
with something like that.

321
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,240
You underestimate your brother too much.

322
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,160
I think your brother

323
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,080
has more potential
than you give him credit for.

324
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,000
Wee and I have always been rivals.

325
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,080
Helping him

326
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,680
means you're against me.

327
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,880
I may be his secretary,

328
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,120
but that doesn't mean
I'm not on your side.

329
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,000
I want to know his secrets.

330
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
What's in it for me?

331
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,520
Anything you want.

332
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,280
Deal.

333
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,760
Your vitamins.

334
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,000
Thanks.

335
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,360
Has Pathawee come home yet?

336
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,280
He's staying at his friend's condo.
He'll be back tomorrow.

337
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,640
We should find a decent woman for him.

338
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,040
It's time for him to settle down.

339
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,080
Matters of the heart
should be left to him.

340
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,080
And what if he ends up
with some nobody from the streets?

341
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,040
Where would that leave
our family's reputation?

342
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,200
I just hope he doesn't end up like Kimhan.
What a disgrace.

343
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,600
Do I need to be like your beloved son?

344
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,640
At least Pathawee

345
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,040
doesn't waste his life

346
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,400
chasing women like you do.

347
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,400
You're disgraceful.

348
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,360
Just like your mother.

349
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
It's more like you.

350
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,480
Why am I like this?

351
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,360
Take a look in the mirror.

352
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,080
You'll see who I take after.

353
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,240
Kim!

354
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,720
Mr. Taychit.

355
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
Look at him.

356
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,560
Rotten to the core, just like his mother.

357
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,360
Every word out of your mouth
is about how terrible my mother was.

358
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,040
What about you?

359
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,520
You're perfect?

360
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Annoying.

361
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
Get out of my house!

362
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,760
Don't ever come back!

363
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,240
Those evils.

364
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,760
They want to kick both of you out

365
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,920
so they can enjoy everything
for themselves.

366
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,920
Disgusting.

367
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,600
They're really from hell.

368
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,280
They can keep dreaming.

369
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll make sure they suffer.

370
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,120
Wait and see

371
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,680
who stays and who goes.

372
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,440
I won't let them take

373
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,480
Mom's land either.

374
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,840
Good.

375
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,520
If your mother weren't too soft-hearted,

376
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,000
that homewrecker

377
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,240
wouldn't have dared
to act so high and mighty.

378
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,680
I can't imagine

379
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
how much pain Mom endured
when she was alive.

380
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,880
If Dad didn't love Mom,

381
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,920
why didn't he just divorce her?

382
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,680
Don't get me started.

383
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,200
He wanted to.

384
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,200
He begged for it.

385
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
Sign it.

386
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,120
Please don't leave me and our children.

387
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,160
I'm begging you.

388
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,960
Please.

389
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,560
Don't leave me.

390
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,960
Listen to me.

391
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,760
I don't love you.

392
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,560
Living together

393
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,040
is just suffering.

394
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,040
Let's end this.

395
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,480
Let's go our own way.

396
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,200
Let's end this. Sign it.

397
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
Don't you care about our kids?

398
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,440
I don't want them
to grow up without a father.

399
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,720
Hey!

400
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,320
Didn't you hear me?

401
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,680
I said I don't love you.

402
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,440
I never did.

403
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,320
I have someone I love.

404
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,440
Let me go, Jitsuda!

405
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,840
Please.

406
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,120
I love you.

407
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,520
Please don't leave me.

408
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,520
Sign it.

409
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,840
- Are you going to sign it or not?
- No!

410
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,080
Hey! Are you going to sign it?!

411
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,080
No.

412
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,600
No?

413
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,080
You're not signing?

414
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,240
I said I never loved you.

415
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,199
- What are you doing?
- No.

416
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,159
Jitsuda, let go of it.

417
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,480
- Let it go.
- I want to die.

418
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,639
Let it go.

419
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,719
What the hell are you doing?

420
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,280
- Jitsuda.
- I don't want to live anymore.

421
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
Stop. Look at me.

422
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,360
Look at me.

423
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,480
How can you die?

424
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,960
What about your children?

425
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,400
If you die, what happens to them?

426
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,920
Do you know how hard it was for me
to carry you for nine months?

427
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,440
To give birth to you?
To raise you to this day?

428
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,640
Do you know

429
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,240
how hard it is?

430
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
And now,

431
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,000
you're just going to throw
your life away because of that bastard?

432
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,040
Don't you think about me at all?

433
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,560
Mom…

434
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,400
Mom…

435
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
Cry.

436
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,680
Let it all out.

437
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,400
Cry as much as you need.

438
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,320
Let your tears wash away the pain.

439
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,160
And forget that bastard.

440
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,480
Look what he's done to you.

441
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,560
He's just an idiot.

442
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,440
Just think of it

443
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,840
as throwing a useless bone to a dog.

444
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,120
If not for Sasi,
Dad wouldn't be like this.

445
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,360
Your father

446
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,000
was completely bewitched.
I don't know what she did to him,

447
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,240
but he let that woman control him.

448
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Your mother lost herself.

449
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
She drowned in alcohol,
drinking all the time.

450
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,160
That's why I had to take
you two in and raise you.

451
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,280
Thank you, Grandma.

452
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,200
If it weren't for you,
I don't know where we'd be.

453
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,720
I love you, Grandma.

454
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,080
I know. You two are the only reason

455
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,280
I keep going.

456
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,920
So?

457
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,920
Now that your father has thrown you out
like garbage, what's your plan?

458
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,000
The more he pushes me away,
the more I want to stay.

459
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,080
Let's see who can endure longer.

460
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,320
They won't enjoy their peace for long.

461
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,520
I'll make sure

462
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,200
karma serves them right.

463
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes, Grandma.

464
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,800
- Where is the tenderloin cut located?
- Between the rib and the flank.

465
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,040
- Where is panna cotta from?
- Italy.

466
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,760
- What type of fish are caviar eggs from?
- Sturgeon.

467
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,480
Who invented "Nam Prik Long Ruea"?

468
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,840
Princess Rajawong Sadap.

469
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,200
Correct! Fantastic job, Namfah!

470
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,880
Wow, Namfah!

471
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,080
With this level of preparation,

472
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,880
I'm sure you'll ace it.
I'll bet my head on it!

473
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
I'm scared that when the real test comes,

474
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,080
I'll be too nervous and forget everything.

475
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,200
Practice makes perfect.

476
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,440
You're great at both theory and practice.
You'll be fine.

477
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,320
There are always people better than me.

478
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,480
I don't feel confident at all.

479
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,320
Well, I can't help you much.
I can't even fry an egg myself.

480
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,240
Like mother, like daughter.

481
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,920
If your mom knew you were
following in her footsteps as a chef,

482
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,280
she'd be so proud.

483
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,040
Mom was a chef?

484
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,320
- Really? Tell me everything right now!
- Hey, wait.

485
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,400
Yes, she was. Let go of me
before my sarong falls off!

486
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,680
Why did you keep this from us?
You never told us.

487
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,440
She was just a chef. It's not like she was
the prime minister. What's the big deal?

488
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,400
- Let me go!
- Wait, Uncle Pu.

489
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,000
Let's talk about this. Don't go yet.

490
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,000
Tell me eveything.

491
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,560
- There's nothing else to tell!
- Tell me.

492
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
Tell me, Uncle Pu.

493
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,520
Uncle Pu knows about Mom

494
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,520
but refuses to tell us.

495
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,400
What do you expect from him?

496
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,960
He says one thing today
and something else tomorrow.

497
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,560
You can't rely on what he says.

498
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,640
But I believe he was telling the truth.

499
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,960
If Mom were here, she'd be so proud
that you want to be a chef like her.

500
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,600
I think she'd be prouder

501
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,240
that she had a daughter
as smart and beautiful as you.

502
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,920
Nubdao.

503
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,800
Look up there.

504
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,840
It looks like a face smiling at us.

505
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,280
You're right.

506
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
Maybe it's Mom's smile.

507
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,800
WHITE PRISON

508
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,200
Watch out!

509
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,480
Sorry.

510
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,880
Are you okay?

511
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,840
I'm fine.

512
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,920
Thank you so much.

513
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,240
Alright. Be more careful next time.

514
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,880
Danger is everywhere.

515
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,520
If something happened to you,
your parents would be devastated.

516
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,640
Alright.

517
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,320
Thank you again.

518
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,600
Take care.

519
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,880
You owe me a lot of money, Pu.

520
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,400
You cheated me.

521
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,240
Talking trash, huh? Then eat this!

522
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,520
I'll give you one week.

523
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,760
If you don't pay up,

524
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,960
I'll cut off your fingers one by one.

525
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,800
Damn cowards.

526
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,560
All this over a few thousand baht?

527
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,320
I should call the cops
and have your whole place shut down.

528
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,240
Huh?

529
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,560
Still as cocky as ever, huh, Pu?

530
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,680
Sis!

531
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,760
I'll handle this.

532
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,080
Well.

533
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,560
It's good to have you back, sis.

534
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,240
Nubdao and Namfah will be so happy

535
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,480
to know their mom's still alive.

536
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,360
No. You can't let them know.

537
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,400
Why not?

538
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,280
You know who my enemy is.

539
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,160
I won't let my children suffer
because of me.

540
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,840
Let them believe
their mother, Daorueang, is dead.

541
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,640
But they're grown now.

542
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,080
How long will you keep hiding this?

543
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,120
Until I find the evidence
and clear my name.

544
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,960
One day,

545
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,560
I'll walk back to them
as an innocent woman,

546
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,320
not a convict, like this.

547
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,160
And where are you going
to find the evidence?

548
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,480
The place I used to work at.

549
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,200
- Taychit's hotel?
- Yes.

550
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,200
No. That's too dangerous.

551
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,080
Taychit has power and money.

552
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,800
How can you fight him?

553
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,640
The truth.

554
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,400
I need your help, Pu. Are you with me?

555
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,400
No.

556
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,960
We made a promise, remember?

557
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,600
If you jump, I jump.

558
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,560
No!

559
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,680
If I fight, you fight too.
Have you forgotten that?

560
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,720
- No!
- Pu.

561
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,640
Sis, revenge only breeds more revenge.

562
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
Then, get ready
to say goodbye to your fingers.

563
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,280
Fine. I'll help.

564
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,920
Thank you for choosing Oriental Paradise.

565
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,960
Yes.

566
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,480
Ms. Sanguansri, is there something
I can help you with?

567
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,360
VIP guest in Room 1042 wants to change

568
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,200
to a poolside suite. Handle it.

569
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,360
Yes, ma'am.

570
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,400
Also, the guest in Room 709

571
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,920
is gluten-intolerant.

572
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,480
Make sure nothing in their meals
contains wheat.

573
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,040
- No mistakes.
- Yes, ma'am.

574
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,400
And in the afternoon,
we're expecting Japanese VIPs.

575
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,680
Double-check their rooms personally.
Don't let them mix with regular guests.

576
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,000
I'll inform
the relevant teams immediately.

577
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,160
Alright.

578
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,280
Oh, and when you're done,

579
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,800
go see Mr. Kimhan in his office.

580
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,160
Do you know what it's about?

581
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,920
I really hate nosy people
who keep asking things.

582
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,280
Just go up there and find out.

583
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,640
Understood.

584
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,160
Whenever I had free time,
I'd come to tidy up,

585
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,680
but this is the best I could do.

586
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,080
- Pu.
- Yes?

587
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,200
Break open this cabinet.

588
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,760
What for?

589
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,240
What?

590
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,680
How did I miss this?

591
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,160
There's a fortune back here! Damn it, Pu!

592
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,080
Pu, did you find anything?

593
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,280
Yeah, sis. Found it.

594
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,800
Whose money is this?

595
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,000
Mine.

596
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,840
Come with us.

597
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,360
Wait. Why are you arresting me?

598
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,760
Keep walking.

599
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,440
This way.

600
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,160
No, I'm not going.
I didn't do anything wrong.

601
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,600
- Go.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

602
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,640
Go.

603
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,600
I didn't do anything wrong.

604
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,720
Captain, here's the evidence.

605
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,920
It's not mine.

606
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,080
- Take her to the station.
- It's not mine.

607
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,440
Let's go.

608
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,520
- It's not mine.
- Go.

609
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,200
Go.

610
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,040
- Go.
- No.

611
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,640
It's not mine.

612
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,640
Go.

613
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,000
Get inside.

614
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,600
Get inside.

615
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,360
If that bastard Taychit
hadn't framed you with drugs,

616
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,640
our lives wouldn't
have turned into this mess.

617
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,000
Right.

618
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,880
I wouldn't have spent years
rotting in prison.

619
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,920
I missed Veha's funeral.

620
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,400
I never even got to say goodbye to him.

621
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,240
I was torn from my kids
when they were little.

622
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,120
I suffered so much.

623
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,560
My heart breaks

624
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,560
every time I think of my children.

625
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,440
I kept wondering. Are they eating well?

626
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,680
Are they sleeping alright?

627
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,160
How are they living without me?

628
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,400
Thank you, Pu.

629
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,960
For sacrificing your youth

630
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,040
to take care of my kids.

631
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,480
If it weren't for you,
I don't know how they would've survived.

632
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,200
They're my nieces.

633
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,560
Give this to my children.

634
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,840
Ten thousand baht.

635
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,560
Sis! I thought you'd help me too!

636
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,640
What about me?

637
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,000
Sis!

638
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,520
Aran!

639
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,920
Aren't you dead?!

640
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,040
No, Aran!

641
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,680
Mr. Taychit.

642
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,160
Was it a nightmare?

643
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,600
Yes, I dreamt that…

644
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,160
Never mind.

645
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,840
It was just a dream. Nothing more.

646
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,960
Nightmares often come from deep anxiety.

647
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,320
Don't overwork yourself.

648
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,120
Didn't you say that once Pathawee
returned, you'd ease up on work?

649
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,040
I can't rest until Pathawee
secures the chairman position after me.

650
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,280
And what about Kimhan?

651
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,880
Shouldn't he be the rightful heir?

652
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,960
He is your son, after all.

653
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,840
Is he? Can we really be sure?

654
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,880
I doubt a woman like Jitsuda

655
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,360
was only with me.

656
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,680
You shouldn't accuse her without proof.

657
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,000
Maybe…

658
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,480
what you believe

659
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,360
may not be the truth.

660
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,480
You're too naive.

661
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,200
You can't see through people.

662
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,840
Unlike me,

663
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,320
I've never been wrong about someone.

664
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,560
Jitsuda was just
as scheming as her mother.

665
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,520
She was just like her mother.

666
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,120
Like mother, like daughter.

667
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,480
Here's the written test for the new hires.
Please take care of it.

668
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,360
Only the top five scorers
will move on to the practical exam.

669
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,560
Even though I'm not the one
taking the test, I still feel nervous.

670
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,960
And we've got way more applicants
this year than usual.

671
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,680
We can only hire one person this time,

672
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,520
so the selection process
has to be tougher than ever.

673
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,320
I need the best candidate to join us.

674
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,600
We're expanding our fine dining division.

675
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,440
Yes. I'll make sure everything
is fair and transparent.

676
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,360
- I'll take my leave now.
- Go ahead.

677
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,600
Ms. Yada, please come to my office.

678
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,520
Hello!

679
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,360
Mr. Lay!

680
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,240
I was just thinking about you.

681
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,680
I know. That's why I came.

682
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,080
Starting tomorrow,
you'll be working for me.

683
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,560
I already told you,

684
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,560
I prefer working in the front office
rather than doing secretarial tasks.

685
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,600
Who said anything
about making you my secretary?

686
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,120
Then why am I being transferred
to work under you?

687
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,160
The front office
is the heart of our hotel.

688
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,920
It's responsible for guest relations,

689
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,360
internal coordination,

690
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,360
and, most importantly,
it generates the highest revenue.

691
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,400
Okay, and?

692
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,480
This department is crucial. I need to…

693
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,600
keep a close eye on things, right?

694
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,600
But you already get reports
from Ms. Sanguansri.

695
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,320
It's not the same.

696
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,240
She oversees overall operations.
You need to handle the finer details

697
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,000
and report directly to me.

698
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,080
Think of it
as a personal liaison role or something.

699
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,520
That's an actual job title?

700
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,440
You'll still be in the front office.
But you'll be reporting to me.

701
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,840
I assume you don't have any objections?

702
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,640
Doesn't matter whether you agree or not.

703
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,680
You have to follow my orders either way.

704
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,080
See you tomorrow.

705
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
Why did you send me this?

706
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,840
I'm starting to think Mr. Pathawee

707
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,120
and his so-called "friend" Talay

708
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,680
are up to something suspicious.

709
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,800
Take a deep breath.
Don't focus on competing with others.

710
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,160
<i>Just beat your own limits</i>

711
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,560
Alright, everyone. Begin the written exam.

712
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,080
Nubdao, do you know
who set the exam questions?

713
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,600
I did.

714
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,800
I know you're all worried,
but what do you want me to do?

715
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,040
Some internet trolls are spreading lies.

716
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,280
I think we should hold a press conference

717
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,560
to clear things up.

718
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,760
