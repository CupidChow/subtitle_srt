1
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Dad, I miss Mom.

2
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Your mother isn't gone.

3
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,040
She's up there,

4
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,560
on a star somewhere in the sky.

5
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
And if you're a good girl,

6
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,320
the angels will send her back to you.

7
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,440
Mom won't come back.

8
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,000
Why, sweetheart?

9
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,680
How can people come back after they die?

10
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,520
You have to believe in goodness, my dear.

11
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,120
Goodness creates miracles.

12
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,200
Remember that.

13
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,520
Don't cry, my dears. Don't cry.

14
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Your mother is at peace now.

15
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,520
It's just us who are left to struggle.

16
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
From now on,

17
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,440
Sasi and Pathawee

18
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,640
will be living here with me.

19
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,280
I want everyone in this house to know.

20
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Your first wife's bones
haven't even been scattered in the river,

21
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,040
and you're bringing your mistress home?

22
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,200
This is my house.

23
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,520
I can bring whoever I want here.

24
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,040
It's none of your business.

25
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,640
Both of you,

26
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,480
bow to your Aunt Sasi.

27
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,720
Shameless!

28
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
Promtawan!

29
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,200
Who taught you to speak like this?

30
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
It was you, wasn't it?
You poisoned their minds!

31
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,240
Oh, please. No one needs to teach them.

32
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
Even a toddler could figure this out.

33
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
Fine.

34
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Promtawan, come here.

35
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
I said, come here!

36
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
You're too stubborn. Come here!

37
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,760
You've got a smart mouth, huh?

38
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
- Here!
- Don't, Dad!

39
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Insolent brats, both of you!
Fine, you'll see!

40
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,680
Please, don't.

41
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,240
- Don't.
- They're your children.

42
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,160
If you want to beat them to death, do it.

43
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,560
Do it!

44
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,040
Promtawan!

45
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
Promtawan!

46
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
If anything happens to my grandchildren,

47
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,040
you will take responsibility!

48
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,960
MRS. JITSUDA BOWORNWISUT
BORN: MAY 24, 1974 - DIED: APRIL 27, 2008

49
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,360
Go back to Grandma first.

50
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,920
Go now.

51
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,080
17 YEARS LATER

52
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm leaving now.

53
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Aunt Phit. Let me help you.

54
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,680
Let me help.

55
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,800
Thank you, Nubdao.
Where are you off to today?

56
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,600
I have a job interview.

57
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,400
- I hope you get the job, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

58
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,520
Alright.

59
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,960
Hey.

60
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,720
Are you okay?

61
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,240
Can you stand up?

62
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,640
Are you hurt anywhere?

63
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,520
Dashing onto the street,
trying to get killed?

64
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,120
You're the one at fault.
This is a residential area.

65
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,720
- Why weren't you slowing down?
- I was in a hurry.

66
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,480
Then wake up earlier.

67
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,280
Well, nobody got hurt,
so let's just move on.

68
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,440
Wait.

69
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,800
What now?

70
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,560
You haven't apologized to the boy yet.

71
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,600
I see.

72
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,160
So, you two are running a scam together?

73
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,760
Fine.

74
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,480
How much do you want?

75
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,040
- What?
- Compensation.

76
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
Isn't that what you're after?

77
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Take it, so we can end this.

78
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
Here. Take it.

79
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,200
And you?

80
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,640
How much do you want?

81
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Money can't buy everything.

82
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,160
True, but only if
you don't have enough of it.

83
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,880
At the very least,
your money can't buy me.

84
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,280
Well, you never know.

85
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm sure of it.

86
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,280
Because after this,
we'll never meet again.

87
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
Maybe in the next life in the afternoon.

88
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I hate people who can't be punctual.

89
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,440
And on your first interview day,

90
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,800
you're already late by…

91
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,160
21 minutes.

92
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,960
I sincerely apologize.

93
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,960
Something unexpected happened on the way.

94
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
I hate people who make excuses.

95
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,160
They always make excuses
out of everything.

96
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,800
I've been working here for 27 years,

97
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,040
probably before you were even born.

98
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,080
I've met all kinds of people.

99
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,520
I can see right through you
the moment you speak.

100
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,160
I take full responsibility for my mistake.

101
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,560
But please, just give me
a chance to be interviewed.

102
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,480
No. Rules are rules.

103
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,600
And punctuality

104
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,080
is a core value of Oriental Paradise!

105
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,080
Please, I'm begging you.

106
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
No.

107
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,800
Your time is up.

108
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,920
Go home.

109
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,920
Wait.

110
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,120
Mr. Kim!

111
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll handle her interview myself.

112
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,840
Yes, sir.

113
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,400
Surprised?

114
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,040
I guess the "next life"
came sooner than expected.

115
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,640
Miss Nubdao Prateepkamol,

116
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,200
25 years old.

117
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,160
But you haven't finished
your bachelor's degree yet?

118
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,480
I took a break. This is my final semester.

119
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,680
My transcript is attached at the back.

120
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,840
GPA 4.00 every semester?

121
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,480
You're quite the nerd.

122
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
If you're this smart,
why did you drop out?

123
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,720
My family had financial problems,
so I had to put my studies on hold.

124
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,640
So, you were desperate for money.

125
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,360
Are you actually
interviewing me for this job?

126
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,480
That's exactly what I'm doing.

127
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,520
Relax, Miss Nubdao.

128
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,960
The Front Office position you applied for
requires patience

129
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,280
and the ability to handle pressure
from all kinds of customers.

130
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,800
I understand that,

131
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,360
but it seems like
you're more interested in messing with me.

132
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,240
You think I'm getting back at you
for arguing with me this morning?

133
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,200
Aren't you?

134
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,000
I know how to separate business
from personal matters.

135
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,560
You don't have to worry about me
being unfair to you, Miss Nubdao.

136
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,360
Do you have any other questions for me?

137
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Yes, an important one.

138
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,400
Do you think

139
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,400
money can buy everything?

140
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I knew you would kick that woman out.

141
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,360
Ms. Sanguansri,

142
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,240
if that woman comes back,

143
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,200
- bring her to me.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Do you think money can buy everything?

145
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,400
I still stand by what I said.
Money can't buy everything.

146
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,400
Oh? And what exactly can't money buy?

147
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,640
Yourself, perhaps?

148
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,560
Huh?

149
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,000
Happiness.

150
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,400
Money can't buy happiness,
no matter how much of it you have.

151
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Money can't buy happiness?

152
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,680
That's just something poor people say
to comfort themselves.

153
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,440
Think about it.

154
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,680
If you had money,
you'd have had opportunities.

155
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,400
You would have graduated a long time ago

156
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,000
instead of struggling to find a job.

157
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,080
Happiness isn't the same for everyone.

158
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Even if I don't live in luxury,

159
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,680
even if I haven't finished my studies,

160
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,760
I'm absolutely sure I'm happier than you.

161
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
Bold words.

162
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,599
I'd love to know
where you get that confidence from.

163
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,880
Because

164
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,720
people who are truly happy
don't belittle others' struggles.

165
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,120
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

166
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,080
Stupid mouth.
I shouldn't have argued with him.

167
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,040
Nubdao!

168
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,880
- Namfah.
- How did it go? Did you get the job?

169
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm lucky he didn't throw me out.

170
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,040
That's okay. If they don't take you,
someone else will.

171
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,560
You're this amazing.

172
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,600
Just graduate soon and come help me work.

173
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,400
This is my final year.

174
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
Once I pay everything off,
I'll be done for sure.

175
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,000
Nubdao, I'm so hungry,
I could eat a whole farm of pigs.

176
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,880
Let's go home.

177
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,760
- A whole farm?
- Yes.

178
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,280
Then I'll make…

179
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
deep-fried pork for dinner.

180
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,400
Deal.

181
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,040
Let's go.

182
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,920
Please forgive me.

183
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,880
Uncle Pu! What are you doing?

184
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,880
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

185
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
Again?

186
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm just borrowing it for a bit.

187
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
No. That's Namfah's tuition money.
Give it back.

188
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,400
Just a little. I'll pay it back.

189
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,920
Gambling never made anyone rich.

190
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,160
You don't understand.
This is called "investment with risks".

191
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,760
Uncle Pu! Give the money back!

192
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,000
Relax.

193
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,520
- I'll be back!
- Uncle Pu!

194
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,920
You thief of an uncle!
Stealing even your own niece's money!

195
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm going!

196
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
Here it is.

197
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,360
This is the last egg. Let's share it.

198
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,160
I'm not hungry.

199
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,720
But you haven't eaten all day.
We're out of rice too.

200
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,800
You eat. You need energy to study tonight.

201
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,400
But you need energy to work
on your translation job too.

202
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,200
If I eat, I'll get sleepy.
No work will get done.

203
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,040
Oops.

204
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,000
Then I'll eat, okay?

205
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,920
Mhm, eat a lot.

206
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,400
225 BAHT

207
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,320
Nubdao, Pu stole
from you again, didn't he?

208
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,680
I saw that bastard running off
with a smug look on his face.

209
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,880
That rotten scumbag…

210
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,120
He even dares to steal from his own niece.

211
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,840
It's okay. I can earn it back.

212
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,360
Have you eaten yet? Are you hungry?

213
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,280
Here, take this.

214
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,160
That's a lot…

215
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,120
I feel bad taking it.
You need to sell these.

216
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
Don't worry about it.

217
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,960
Eat as much as you can,

218
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,560
and keep the rest for yourself
and your sister tomorrow.

219
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,440
Namfah.

220
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Aunt Phit gave us this.

221
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,280
Nubdao!

222
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,960
We're saved!

223
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,720
- This will last us for days.
- What do we have?

224
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,400
I told you not to mess this up.

225
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm sorry, sir.

226
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,040
I didn't expect someone else
to snatch that land from us.

227
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,560
That was a prime location.

228
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,600
Finding another like it won't be easy.

229
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,600
Just thinking about it
makes me regret losing it.

230
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,160
I planned to build
the new Oriental Paradise there.

231
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,960
I'll find an even better one for you.

232
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,760
Just wait a little more, sir.

233
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,080
Wait?

234
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,720
Yes, sir.

235
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,680
Some things have their own timing

236
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
and cannot wait.

237
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,600
Just like this tea.

238
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,720
Ugh!

239
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,320
Your failure

240
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,520
cost me dearly.

241
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,240
My entire plan

242
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,840
is now ruined.

243
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,600
Everyone makes mistakes.

244
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,360
But not the people who work for me.

245
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,640
Yos.

246
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Yes, sir.

247
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,920
Sir, please. I'm sorry.

248
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,280
Yos,

249
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,760
punish him for me.

250
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,560
And find me a more competent agent.

251
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
Yes, sir.

252
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,760
Mr. Yos.

253
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,400
No, please!

254
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,040
Here's some hot bird's nest soup.

255
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,400
Oh.

256
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,240
Just what I needed.

257
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,360
You really know me.

258
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,880
You're home late.
The doctor told you to rest more.

259
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,560
I had to take care of things at the hotel.

260
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,440
Honestly, just being near you
feels like a break already.

261
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,600
Ugh. I want to throw up.

262
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,560
Do you have to start drama
the second you walk in?

263
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,360
Did you get a tattoo?

264
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,160
You see it. Why ask?

265
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,080
Why would you ruin your body like this?

266
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,040
- Hey…
- Didn't you see?

267
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,400
She does this to spite me.

268
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,640
She just got home. Speak to her nicely.

269
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,840
Bravo.

270
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,320
You should win an acting award.

271
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,120
But no matter how much
you act like a saint,

272
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,640
a mistress is still a mistress.

273
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,560
You'll never fool me.

274
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,760
Where are you going?

275
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,520
Anywhere far from annoying fake people.

276
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,040
Tawan, stop.

277
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,280
Wait!

278
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,080
Look at her.
This is what kids are like today.

279
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,080
Just give her time.

280
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,600
One day, she'll understand.

281
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
Has Kim come back yet?

282
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,080
Mr. Kim.

283
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Can I stay the night?

284
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,400
No one ever stays the night.

285
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
Then I'll be the first.

286
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
Go get dressed.

287
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,000
When will I see you again?

288
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,320
I don't know.

289
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,760
What do you mean?

290
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,240
You mean

291
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,600
you're just going to throw me away?

292
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
I gave myself to you.

293
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,640
This ruins my reputation.

294
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
You had fun.

295
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
I had fun.

296
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,080
Win-win. What more do you want?

297
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Hm?

298
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,240
I won't accept this.

299
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,560
Won't accept it?

300
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,480
How much?

301
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,880
That's your price.

302
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,400
200,000 BAHT

303
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,560
When will you love me, Kim?

304
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,680
It's late. Talk to him tomorrow.

305
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,760
Kimhan,

306
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,360
I have something important
to talk with you.

307
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,840
Is it urgent? I'm exhausted.

308
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,680
You're useless.
I can't rely on you for anything.

309
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
Haven't I done

310
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,120
enough already?

311
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,440
Don't forget

312
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,080
who gave you everything you have today.

313
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,080
Wasn't it me?

314
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,520
I built all this for you,

315
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,520
so you could live a comfortable life.

316
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,520
You have money to spend every day.

317
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,840
And what about Mother?
Where did you throw her away?

318
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,080
She helped you build this life,
and you abandoned her.

319
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,760
Even on the day Mom died,
you were sleeping with her.

320
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,040
Ever since this woman entered our house,

321
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,760
you forgot everything.

322
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,920
You forgot Mom.
You forgot me. You forgot my sister.

323
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,840
And who do you think killed Mom?

324
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,880
Who do you think made her
waste away in sorrow? It was you.

325
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,160
Because of you!

326
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,800
Because of your mistress!

327
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,560
But I love her!

328
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,240
She makes me happy!

329
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,400
Oh, so she must be amazing in bed, huh?

330
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,440
You little--

331
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,840
Is this what you want?

332
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,000
Go ahead.

333
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,720
Hit me. What are you waiting for?

334
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,920
Get out of here!

335
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,280
I don't want to see your face anymore!

336
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,719
<i>Ever since this woman entered our house,</i>
<i>you forgot everything.</i>

337
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,800
You forgot Mom.
You forgot me. You forgot my sister.

338
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,920
And who do you think killed Mom?

339
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,840
Who do you think made her
waste away in sorrow? It was you.

340
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,800
Because of your mistress!

341
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,480
<i>But I love her! She makes me happy!</i>

342
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,040
Is he even human?

343
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
His wife is dying,

344
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,440
and he doesn't even show up
to see her one last time.

345
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,600
Too busy with his damn mistress.
Absolutely despicable.

346
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,360
Kimhan,

347
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,920
if I'm not here anymore,

348
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,560
take care of your sister.

349
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,120
Yes, Mom.

350
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,040
But where are you going?

351
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,320
Promtawan,

352
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,960
don't be naughty.

353
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,400
Listen to your brother.

354
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,560
Yes, Mom.

355
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,280
Mother,

356
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,640
please take care of my children.

357
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Of course.

358
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,520
It's just two kids. I can raise them.

359
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,240
Kimhan…

360
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,320
- Mom!
- Mom!

361
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,000
Mom.

362
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,160
‪Mom.

363
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,280
Mom.

364
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,440
I will protect everything
that belonged to you

365
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,360
with my life, Mom.

366
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,640
Did you finish your work last night?

367
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,920
I did,

368
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,640
but I won't get paid until next month.

369
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,360
Good thing Aunt Phit gave us food.
We survived another meal.

370
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
And it's all because of Uncle Pu.

371
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,120
Nubdao, is Uncle Pu
really our blood relative?

372
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,200
Of course, he is. Why do you ask?

373
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,080
He doesn't seem to care about us at all.

374
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,440
He only ever causes problems.

375
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,680
If Mom and Dad were still here,
things would be different.

376
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,720
‪Dad and Mom are at peace now.

377
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,360
‪Hurry and eat,
‪or you’ll be late for class.

378
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,040
Lost everything again, didn't you?

379
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,720
Namfah! You're the one who jinxed me!
Damn unlucky.

380
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,880
You wasted all of my savings.
Money that was meant for Namfah's tuition.

381
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,040
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

382
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,480
I'll find a way to pay you back.

383
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Stop nagging already.

384
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,960
Everything looks delicious!

385
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,920
Nubdao, get me a plate.

386
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm starving. Hurry up!

387
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Uncle!

388
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,960
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

389
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,200
Uncle!

390
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,360
Uncle!

391
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,400
Ugh, my noodles.

392
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,680
Today, I need to find a job.

393
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,480
Should I drop out and work to help you?

394
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,680
No way. You have to graduate.
I'll handle the money.

395
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,680
But you couldn't finish school
because you had to support me.

396
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,840
I don't want to be a burden.

397
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,640
I already feel like
I'm taking too much from you.

398
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,080
Let me help you, please.

399
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,200
Namfah, listen to me.

400
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,400
We only have each other.

401
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,920
We need to support one another.

402
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,640
Today, I take care of you.

403
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,640
Tomorrow, when you graduate,
you can help me.

404
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,880
We rely on each other.

405
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,120
No one's taking advantage of anyone.

406
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,080
Then I'll clean the house this evening.

407
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,040
Let's go.

408
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,040
Can you mop, too?

409
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,680
Alright, fine.

410
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,680
I'm really sorry, dear. I can't hire you.

411
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,840
Please, I really need this job.

412
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,280
- Please.
- I have to ask my boss first.

413
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,840
HIRING ONE CASHIER

414
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,880
Hello.

415
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,400
Really?

416
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,200
Yes, I can make it. Fifteen minutes?

417
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,120
I'll be there right away.

418
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,040
I will hire you

419
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,920
as a Front Office Trainee.

420
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,840
Yes.

421
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,680
Since you haven't graduated yet,

422
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,640
you must pass all three tests

423
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,520
from different departments

424
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,440
without a single mistake.

425
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,440
Do you accept?

426
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,040
I accept.

427
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,160
But let me warn you.

428
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,760
I hate

429
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,120
people who talk big and sound impressive

430
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,560
but are utterly useless
when it comes to actual work.

431
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,560
I won't let you down, Ms. Sanguansri.

432
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,800
Good.

433
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,800
Then, let's begin the first test.

434
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,840
The Front Office is one
of the most important departments.

435
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,480
It is the face of the hotel

436
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,880
to welcome the guests.

437
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,560
This is the floor plan
and the complete list of room numbers

438
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,120
at Oriental Paradise.

439
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,360
You have 15 minutes

440
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,960
to memorize the locations
of all the rooms,

441
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,960
banquet halls,
conference rooms, restaurants,

442
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,880
and recreational areas.

443
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,480
Not a single mistake is allowed.

444
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,520
Let's start counting down.

445
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,040
Has your chest pain subsided?

446
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
Yeah.

447
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,480
It comes and goes.

448
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,480
Who knows when I'll drop dead.

449
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,600
You need to take better care of yourself.

450
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,360
Exercise a little.
And most importantly, don't stress.

451
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,000
How can I not stress?

452
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,640
Look at Promtawan and Kimhan.

453
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,880
The fact that I'm not insane by now
is a miracle.

454
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,360
Kimhan left for work early this morning.

455
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,560
Was there an urgent matter at the hotel?

456
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,160
Work?

457
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,400
That guy?
He's probably out juggling his women,

458
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,600
making sure
his "train schedules" don't collide.

459
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,360
That alone keeps him
too busy to actually work.

460
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,160
Maybe what he really needs
is someone to understand him.

461
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,560
Have you ever tried?

462
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,760
You were just like this

463
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,360
when you were young.

464
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,800
Even worse.

465
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,080
But I stopped everything
the moment I met you.

466
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,000
Well.

467
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,240
If only Pathawee were here.

468
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,880
At least I could count on him.

469
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,920
When is he coming back from Paris?

470
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,120
He's finished his studies,

471
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,360
but he's taking some time to travel.

472
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,040
He'll be back soon.

473
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,400
Time's up!

474
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,560
Let the test begin.

475
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,640
Where is the Phuang Kram Conference Room?

476
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,680
12th floor, Room 1204, North Wing.

477
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,960
12th floor, Room 1204,

478
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,800
North Wing.

479
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,960
Where is the International Restaurant?

480
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,640
The International Restaurant
is on the second floor.

481
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,960
East Wing.

482
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,640
Where are the fitness center and sauna?

483
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,560
Fitness room, second floor.

484
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,960
Room 201.

485
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,640
Sauna is on the same floor,

486
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,840
Room 203.

487
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,880
South Wing.

488
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,720
What about the Luxury Suites?

489
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,280
All of them?

490
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,320
All of them.

491
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,240
19th floor.

492
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,560
- Rooms 1901 to 1905,
- <i>Rooms 1901 to 1905, North Wing.</i>

493
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,000
North Wing.

494
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,440
20th floor.

495
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,600
Rooms 2010 to 2015, East Wing.

496
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,920
- And Rooms 2027 to 2029.
- Rooms 2027 to 2029,

497
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,320
South Wing.

498
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,960
That's incredible.

499
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,400
I've worked here for ten years

500
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,160
and still can't recall
those luxury suite room numbers.

501
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,560
Fine. You pass the first test.

502
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,400
You really are something, aren't you?

503
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,000
The second test…

504
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,600
I hope you perform as well as the first.

505
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,640
But let me warn you. This one is tougher.

506
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,120
I'm ready.

507
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:33,040
Oriental Paradise has a history
spanning over three decades.

508
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,520
We've overcome many crises

509
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,360
to become the leading hotel we are today.

510
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,720
Do you know who founded this place?

511
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,680
Mr. Techit Bowornwisut,
Mr. Kimhan's father.

512
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,120
Not yet. That's not the full answer.

513
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,080
<i>The founder of Oriental Paradise</i>

514
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,600
<i>wasn't just Mr. Techit.</i>

515
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,360
That's the easy answer.
Anyone could say that.

516
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,320
But the truth is,

517
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,600
there was another co-founder
from the very beginning.

518
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,400
If you're applying to work here,

519
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,960
don't tell me you don't even know
who built this place.

520
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,160
I hate people

521
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,280
who don't respect
the hands that feed them.

522
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,040
That's harsh, Miss Sanguansri.

523
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,320
Please let me get this job.

524
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,360
MR. ARAN JIRACHAWALAI
1968 - 1998

525
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,280
<i>Nubdao!</i>

526
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,000
Mr. Aran Jirachawalai?

527
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,040
How did you know?

528
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,120
I saw his statue
in the garden behind the hotel.

529
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,200
The second test, passed!

530
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,200
Yes?

531
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,800
Thank you!

532
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,480
Don't celebrate yet.

533
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,680
You have one final test.

534
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,840
Tomorrow, Mr. Kimhan,

535
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,440
Vice President of Oriental Paradise,

536
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,280
will personally assess you.

537
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,640
You really are interesting,

538
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,480
Nubdao.

539
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,480
What kind of brother is Uncle Pu?

540
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,360
He doesn't even have
a single picture of Mom.

541
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,280
Hey, your house burned down.

542
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,240
It was good enough
I saved you two, wasn't it?

543
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,240
Did you make that up?
Dad never told me about that.

544
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,600
Why would I make this up?

545
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,560
If I hadn't pulled you out, you wouldn't
be standing here arguing with me now.

546
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,520
You should show some gratitude.

547
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,080
And who knows?
Maybe you just made that story up.

548
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,920
How many of the five precepts
do you even keep?

549
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,800
Namfah!

550
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,920
Show your uncle some respect!

551
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,320
Respect?

552
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,280
You're a grown man
who still can't think for himself.

553
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,440
Namfah.

554
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,320
Don't be disrespectful.

555
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,280
Apologize to him.

556
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,840
But Nubdao…

557
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,560
Fine.

558
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,600
I'm sorry.

559
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,720
So, Nub,

560
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,360
did you get the job?

561
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,480
I still don't know.
I have another interview tomorrow.

562
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,880
What the hell? This hotel is very picky.

563
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,400
It's a luxury hotel. They have standards.

564
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,160
When will you find out?

565
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,120
Tomorrow. Why?

566
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,880
Well, I wanted
to discuss business with you.

567
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,000
I knew it. You didn't even have to say it.

568
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,000
Just a hundred, maybe 200?

569
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,120
I don't have any money for you.

570
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,520
What the hell, Nubdao?

571
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,720
I've raised you.

572
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,120
By letting us feed ourselves?

573
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,600
You took all my savings.

574
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,120
I barely have enough for transportation.
Find another way.

575
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,920
Fine.

576
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,920
I'm going now.

577
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,520
Stop!

578
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,160
Are you my niece or my mother?

579
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,680
How were you raised?

580
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,600
How could you even think
of stealing Nubdao's purse?

581
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,040
What is your heart made of?

582
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,320
I really want to hit you.

583
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,680
Whoa, stop!

584
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,440
<i>Freeloaders have it easy.</i>

585
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,280
<i>They just leech off others</i>
<i>their whole lives.</i>

586
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,160
Welcome home.

587
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,680
I hope you enjoy your happiness
built on the suffering of others,

588
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,960
just like what you
and your mother have done to us.

589
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,680
How's working with my brother?

590
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,760
Mr. Kimhan is…

591
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,040
From now on,
never talk to him alone again.

592
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,040
Why can't I talk to Mr. Pathawee?

593
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,200
Because I'm ordering you not to.

594
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,240
Nubdao!

595
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,960
Go see your sister!

596
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,160
Namfah!

597
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,720
Namfah!

598
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,040
Namfah!

599
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,840
Namfah!

600
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,720
