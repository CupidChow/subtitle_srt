1
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
All ten pieces are intact. You pass.

2
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,440
I made it, Nubdao!

3
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,320
I made it!

4
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,720
Auntie.

5
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
I just wanted to thank you

6
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,880
for teaching me how to shuck oysters.

7
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,080
We’ve been talking all this time,
but I still don’t know your name.

8
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,280
What's your name?

9
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
My name is Ratree.

10
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,520
She's just a scapegoat.

11
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,520
Does she really think she can hurt me?

12
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,560
You know I don’t get along with Pathawee.

13
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,560
So, don't spend time with him.
Clear enough?

14
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,360
Listen to me first. Nubdao!

15
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,040
I’m sorry for losing my temper earlier.

16
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Just don’t do it again.

17
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,600
If you hadn’t helped me,
I’d be missing a few fingers by now.

18
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,440
I wasn’t planning on helping you for free.

19
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,720
Then, what do you want me to do?

20
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,440
Ms. Wadee? What are you sending me now?

21
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,200
I don’t care where they are.

22
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,760
You have to drag them here.

23
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
Mr. Pathawee.

24
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
Come on.

25
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,640
Mr. Wee.

26
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Don’t forget our deal.

27
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,920
<i>Okay.</i>

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
If you help me,
I’ll help you with anything you need.

29
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,240
So, what do you need my help with?

30
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,400
What?

31
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,960
Track down the chef
behind the Eat With Me page?

32
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Why? You can’t you help me?

33
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Come on. Please help me.
I really want to meet him.

34
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,640
And then what?

35
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,560
I want to thank him.

36
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,600
I got this job because of him.

37
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,880
And the praise I’ve received today,
it’s all thanks to him.

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
You could just send him a message.

39
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,400
No way! I have to thank him in person.

40
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,440
Please help me, Mr. Wee. Please…

41
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,920
And if I say no?

42
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,320
Then forget about winning Nubdao’s heart.

43
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
I bet Taychit was shocked
to receive my little gift.

44
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
A single sandalwood flower?

45
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,840
You really made me take a risk for that?

46
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
I needed to know how to get close to him.

47
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
Who are you here to see?

48
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Hello. I’m here on behalf of Miss Wadee.

49
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,920
I have a package for Mr. Taychit.

50
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,200
Visitors are not allowed upstairs.

51
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,320
Do I need to leave my ID
at the counter first?

52
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,360
Yes, but without an appointment,
you still can’t go up.

53
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,040
Then how will the package get to him?

54
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,000
You can leave it here at the counter.

55
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,640
- I have to deliver it myself.
- You can't do that.

56
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,080
- You can't do that.
- You can't go in.

57
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,760
Alright, alright, I surrender.

58
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,000
There’s no way to get close to Taychit.

59
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,840
You told me
Ms. Wadee’s name would get me in.

60
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,160
Honestly, forget it.

61
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,480
Getting into his bed would be easier.

62
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Why did you bring me here?

63
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,520
You were looking
for evidence, weren’t you?

64
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,880
This is the hotel’s document archive.

65
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,040
You might find something here.

66
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,200
But if I go through all of this all day,

67
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,400
won’t Ms. Sanguansri get upset?

68
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
Since when did Ms. Sanguansri
become more important than me?

69
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,520
Well, I hope you find
what you’re looking for,

70
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,240
so Ms Sanguansri will finally
approve of you working here.

71
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,000
Who is that person?!

72
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,920
Who is he?!

73
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,840
Yes, boss.

74
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Yes.

75
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,000
Forgive me.

76
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,440
Fire!

77
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,240
Fire!

78
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,000
Nubdao! Come here!

79
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,440
Namfah! Let’s go!

80
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
What should I do?

81
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,560
I asked you who he is.

82
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,320
I’ll investigate right away
and find out who he is.

83
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,160
Why waste time on the delivery guy?

84
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,800
Why not go after the one who sent him?

85
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,160
Who, sir?

86
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,080
Mirantee, you idiot!

87
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,280
Finish the job,

88
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,960
just like you used to.

89
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,240
And don’t forget.

90
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,960
Only you and I know about this.

91
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,760
If my secret gets out,

92
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
both you

93
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,760
and that scapegoat

94
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,200
will never breathe again.

95
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,400
2006

96
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,840
Whoa!

97
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,520
Be careful.

98
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,200
Your foot’s injured, isn’t it?

99
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,080
I found it.

100
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,240
Thank you.

101
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,120
The hotel has an anniversary book?

102
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,000
You’ve never seen it before?

103
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
Never.

104
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,960
Have you ever met Mr. Aran?

105
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,600
No.

106
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,400
I only know he was my father’s
close friend and co-founder of the hotel.

107
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,600
Then, is it possible

108
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,840
this book might have
some records about his death?

109
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,480
<i>Today, we’re making</i>
<i>a traditional French dish.</i>

110
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,560
<i>Start by slicing the onions lengthwise.</i>

111
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,400
<i>Sauté them in butter until caramelized.</i>

112
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,520
<i>This takes about 30 minutes.</i>

113
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,640
<i>Once they’re golden brown…</i>

114
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,920
You should give up on finding him.

115
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,520
<i>Season with salt and pepper, and serve…</i>

116
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,240
He won’t reveal himself.

117
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,320
No.

118
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,120
I will find him.
I have to meet him in person.

119
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,240
That serious?

120
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,400
I love him.

121
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,720
Love?

122
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
You’ve never even seen his face.

123
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,320
Yeah.

124
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,160
But I don’t love him for his looks.
I love him for his talent.

125
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,000
Why? Haven’t you ever fallen for someone
without seeing their face before?

126
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,560
Never.

127
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,680
So, that means you care more
about looks than personality or talent.

128
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,200
And how do you know he is a good person?

129
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,480
He might not be as great as you think.

130
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,360
He could be a fraud, a scam artist.
Who knows?

131
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,600
Mr. Wee, watch your mouth.
Don’t insult my mysterious chef.

132
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,800
He’s a good person. I can feel it.
My instincts tell me so.

133
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,160
Okay, okay. No more insults.

134
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,960
He must be thrilled
to have such a devoted fan.

135
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,080
This is the chairman…

136
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,440
And the man next to him must be Mr. Aran.

137
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,000
And this is Ms. Sasi,

138
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,800
the chairman’s wife.

139
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,200
But who is the woman standing here?

140
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,040
Her name is Jitsuda.

141
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,520
My mother.

142
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,520
She passed away when I was eight.

143
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Believe it or not,

144
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,119
my father never attended
her funeral. Not even once.

145
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,520
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.

146
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,760
It’s not your fault.

147
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,960
It’s just one of the painful truths
of my life.

148
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
We all carry scars.

149
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
Stay strong. I’m rooting for you.

150
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,440
"A funeral service
was held for Mr. Aran Jirachawalai,

151
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,880
co-founder of Oriental Paradise Hotel,

152
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,360
who passed away on August 13, 1998,

153
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,600
amidst deep sorrow
from executives and employees."

154
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,080
FUNERAL OF ARAN JIRACHAWALAI

155
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Why is there
so little information on this?

156
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,560
Did you find any leads?

157
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,040
Just basic details we already knew.

158
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,640
So, the rumors online aren’t true.

159
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,280
Mr. Aran committed suicide.
He wasn’t murdered.

160
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,640
I don’t know.

161
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
But there’s one thing I suspect.

162
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,520
Mr. Aran and Ms. Sasi might have had
a romantic relationship before.

163
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,240
Wait.

164
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,240
You mean they were together
before Ms. Sasi

165
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,000
married Mr. Taychit? Really?

166
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Looking at the old photos,
they don’t seem like just colleagues.

167
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,320
Let me see.

168
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,800
Who’s this woman?

169
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,160
GOOD LUCK, MIRANTEE

170
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,120
Maybe a friend of Mr. Aran.

171
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,720
If she was his friend,
she must’ve known how he died.

172
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,760
Who is she? How do we find her?

173
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,440
"Good luck, Mirantee.

174
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,160
I hope you achieve your dream
of becoming a Michelin-star chef.

175
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,640
Keep fighting. From Aran."

176
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,880
Mirantee…

177
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,440
Captain.

178
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,080
Here's the evidence.

179
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,560
It's you.

180
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,560
Forgive me.

181
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
If you don’t die, I will.

182
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Who’s there?

183
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,800
Miss?

184
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,640
Miss?

185
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,200
Sis!

186
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,320
Sis! Sis!

187
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,120
Blood…

188
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,360
What happened? Sis! Sis!

189
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,360
What the hell happened to you?

190
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Sis!

191
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,880
Sis!

192
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,720
Could it be that the chef named Mirantee
was Mr. Aran’s old flame?

193
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,800
From the photos, it doesn’t seem like it.

194
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
They look more like close friends.

195
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,080
Mr. Aran worked in the Food
and Beverage department at the hotel,

196
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
so he must have known that chef well.

197
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,520
Are you still obsessed with this?

198
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
You’re acting like a detective.

199
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,520
It’s part of my job.

200
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,240
The bookings are declining because of it.

201
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,720
How can I just sit around and do nothing?

202
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,320
Good morning, Ms. Nubdao.

203
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
Mr. Wee!

204
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
Mr. Pathawee.

205
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,040
You’re about to tell me not to pick you up
anymore because you feel bad, right?

206
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,360
Yes, and also--

207
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,000
You’re worried it won’t look good for me
to be picking you up and dropping you off.

208
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,360
You know that, yet you still do it.

209
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,000
How should I put it?

210
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,280
Let’s just say I’m happy to do it.

211
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,760
If you're happy, then we’re happy too.

212
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,120
You can pick us up every day.

213
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,080
That way, we won’t have to
take the bus to work. Right?

214
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,800
Namfah, how could you say that?
That’s rude.

215
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,240
Don’t scold Namfah.

216
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,800
So…

217
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,880
I’ll pick you up tomorrow then?

218
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,040
Yes!

219
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,200
You’re welcome
to use my office as you like.

220
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,000
Are you really planning
to read all of these?

221
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,520
I need to gather
as much information as possible.

222
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,680
This concerns
the hotel’s reputation and image.

223
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,240
If I can find evidence explaining
why Mr. Aran chose to end his life,

224
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,440
the public will stop speculating.

225
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,200
You seem to care
about this hotel more than I do.

226
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,200
I have to protect it.

227
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,640
This hotel is our future.

228
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,440
Maybe…

229
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,440
Mr. Aran was heartbroken,
and that’s why he took his own life.

230
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,440
He shot himself over a broken heart?

231
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,400
True love isn’t easy to find.

232
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,400
Exactly.

233
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,680
That’s why I’m still single.

234
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,080
I haven’t found true love yet.

235
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,800
Then I hope you find it soon.

236
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,880
Sis…

237
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,040
How are you?

238
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,240
Here,

239
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,320
let me help.

240
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,320
Take it slow.

241
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,640
Take it slow.

242
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,080
Alright.

243
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,480
Okay, easy now.

244
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,520
You’re tough.

245
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,280
Seriously,
if I hadn’t found you last night,

246
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,720
you would’ve bled out and died.

247
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
Eat something. You need strength.

248
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,640
Here, I made this myself.

249
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,080
It’s edible.

250
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,600
Eat a little bit.

251
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
You need strength.

252
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,440
Open your mouth.

253
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,720
Ah, it's falling.

254
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,840
Who did this to you?

255
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,600
Yot.

256
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,440
It's you.

257
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,640
That damn lapdog of Taychit.

258
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh, hell no! We can’t stay here. Let's go.

259
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,680
Don't go yet. Wait.

260
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,640
They must've thought I'm dead.

261
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,880
So what?

262
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,480
That means we can get even closer
to Taychit now.

263
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,960
You still wanna go after him?

264
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,360
Just let it go.

265
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,160
I don't want it anymore. Look at yourself.

266
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Sis…

267
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,200
Sis, you did this to yourself.

268
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
Just look at you.

269
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,160
How can you get close to him?

270
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,720
Ms. Sanguansri, do you know a chef
named Mirantee who used to work here?

271
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,920
How do you know Mirantee worked here?

272
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,240
I saw a photo of her tucked inside a book.

273
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,960
Destroy that picture. Immediately.

274
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,880
That person must have
no connection to this hotel whatsoever.

275
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,320
It’s that serious?

276
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,840
Don’t ever say that name out loud again.

277
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Especially in front of the chairman.
Remember that.

278
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,840
What's the matter?

279
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,000
It's not a very good thing.
It’s about Mr. Pathawee.

280
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,560
Say it.

281
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,960
Lately,

282
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,920
he hasn’t been coming home
after work, has he?

283
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,080
You know where he’s been?

284
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,280
I have something to show you.

285
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,640
Oh, come on…

286
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,160
Just one kiss!

287
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,520
Whoa.

288
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,720
What's with you?

289
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,280
Whoa.

290
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,880
Drive safe, okay?

291
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,320
Alright.

292
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,560
Want me to see you off?

293
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,160
What are you doing?

294
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,520
See you.

295
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Bring Pathawee to me. Now.

296
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,400
Yes, sir.

297
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,480
Sit down.

298
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,200
What were you doing
at that condo in Sukhumvit?

299
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Visiting a friend.

300
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,800
You’re sure it’s just a friend?

301
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,360
Yes. What’s this about?

302
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,240
I don’t care what you are,

303
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,800
but at least

304
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,800
have some respect for my reputation.

305
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,560
Well…

306
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,520
I just wanted to do what I love.

307
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,280
But I never revealed my identity.

308
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,320
I don’t care whether you reveal it or not.
I just can’t accept it.

309
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,080
I'm sorry.

310
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,840
Quit it.

311
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
I can’t.

312
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,720
You have to!

313
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,320
If you don’t stop,

314
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,760
I’ll send you overseas.

315
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,239
You don't want to disappoint
your mom, do you?

316
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,040
You might be fine
with your brother’s preferences,

317
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,920
but the chairman won’t be.

318
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,120
You should brace yourself
for some good news soon.

319
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,480
I think I have to…

320
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,840
stop doing Eat With Me.

321
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Why?

322
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,440
We’ve got over
three million followers now.

323
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,560
My dad probably knows by now

324
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,880
that I’m the mysterious chef.

325
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,720
He never wanted me to be a chef.

326
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,080
And he’s ordering me
to shut the page down.

327
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,600
What’s so bad about being a chef?

328
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,840
It’s a damn lucrative job.

329
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,000
He probably wants me to go
into management instead.

330
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,240
If I don’t, he’ll see it as losing to Kim.

331
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,680
Your dad is so old-school.

332
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,480
So, what now?

333
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,720
Are you really quitting?

334
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
I have to shut it down for a while.

335
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,600
Whatever you decide, I’m with you.

336
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,840
What? Why?

337
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
EAT WITH ME IS OFFICIALLY
SHUTTING DOWN INDEFINITELY

338
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
What?

339
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,640
Eat With Me just announced
an indefinite shutdown.

340
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,680
They have so many followers.

341
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,920
Maybe the admin is busy?

342
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,440
Maybe the chef got sick.

343
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Or got into an accident.

344
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,800
Or a fire, or a boiling water burn,
or got COVID, or prostate cancer, or…

345
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,880
No way! He was right there,
and now he’s gone!

346
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,480
If they haven’t posted a memorial message,
it means the chef is still alive.

347
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
You’re right.

348
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
But what if he’s bedridden?

349
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,560
Hooked up to an IV drip in some hospital?

350
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Will be be okay?

351
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,920
Nubdao…

352
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,040
I want to go visit him.

353
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,160
You’ve never seen his face.
How can you know where he is?

354
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,400
Just watch me. I’ll find out exactly
where the mysterious chef is.

355
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,360
This tastes terrible.

356
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,920
And this fermented soy dip
is sickeningly sweet.

357
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Are they trying to give me
diabetes or what?

358
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,080
The old cook resigned recently, ma’am.

359
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,480
Then just order food
from the hotel for now.

360
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,800
Can’t you see that Grandma can’t eat this?

361
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,040
Yes, of course, ma’am.
I’ll call them right away.

362
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,160
Go now.

363
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,600
I can't swallow it.

364
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,520
These days,

365
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,000
good cooks are so hard to find.

366
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,720
Many people

367
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,440
are just doing it without passion.

368
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,960
If this keeps up,
I’m going to starve to death.

369
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,120
I’ll find you skilled chefs
to choose from, Grandma.

370
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,440
Alright.

371
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,400
I can’t shake this worry.

372
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,240
If people find out about his preferences,

373
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,040
how will I hold my head up?

374
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,320
They might just be friends.

375
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,040
Boys play around like that all the time.

376
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,920
But even if Wee does like men,

377
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,680
I don't see why it's a big deal.

378
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,200
Society today is much more accepting.

379
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,080
It’s not like the past.

380
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,000
As long as he’s a good person,
that’s what matters.

381
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,880
Wait.

382
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,600
You might be fine with it, but I'm not.

383
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,720
I don't want to be shamed
for raising a son like that.

384
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,880
You need to open your mind a little.

385
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,320
If you keep pushing him,
you’re only driving him further away.

386
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,640
Let me talk to him when I get the chance.

387
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,880
This right here is where
I’m going to build the hotel’s garden.

388
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,920
A peaceful place for guests
to relax and unwind.

389
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,360
What a waste of space.

390
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,920
A seminar room or a banquet hall
would be better.

391
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,800
Right, Sasi?

392
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,160
I don’t mind either way.
but I’d like our garden to have…

393
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,120
Orchids.

394
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,640
See? Now you can’t argue
with me anymore. Sasi wants it.

395
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,120
Fine, if Sasi likes orchids,

396
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,160
I’ll make sure the gardeners
take extra care of them.

397
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,920
Alright, take a picture of me and Sasi.

398
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,440
Make sure the orchids are in the shot too.

399
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Come on, Sasi.

400
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,800
Be careful.

401
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,320
Done.

402
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,760
I think we should name the hotel
Oriental Paradise.

403
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The heaven of the East.

404
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,160
I like it. It’s elegant, meaningful…

405
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,440
Sasi, what do you think?

406
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,040
I love it.

407
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,120
You still haven’t forgotten him.

408
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,480
Aran was the best man I ever knew.

409
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,080
And what about me?

410
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Is there any part of your heart
that belongs to me?

411
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,440
Why are you asking me this?

412
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,840
What do you want me to say?

413
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
Just tell me the truth.

414
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,200
Tell me
if I ever had a place in your heart.

415
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,480
Please…

416
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,280
Don’t make me lie to you.

417
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,480
I know, Sasi.

418
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,120
I know.

419
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,480
Taychit.

420
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,600
THAI BAHT'S VALUE DROPS

421
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,240
I’ll be back in a bit.

422
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,840
Okay.

423
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,360
1999

424
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,080
"In 1997,
the Thai government floated the baht,

425
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,160
causing its value to drop by over 50%.

426
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,800
Within just six months,

427
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,240
the hotel was in debt,
over 400 million baht."

428
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,440
Four hundred million in debt?

429
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,240
"Mr. Taychit Bowornwisut,

430
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,680
President of the Board,
visits Mr. Aran Jirachawalai,

431
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,080
co-founder of the hotel,

432
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,000
during treatment for heart disease."

433
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Mr. Aran had heart disease too?

434
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,840
Where’s that coming from?

435
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,560
Mr. Kim isn’t here.

436
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,880
Maybe I’m working too hard
and just hearing things.

437
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,320
So many documents.

438
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,560
A lot of work.

439
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,360
Mr. Kim is really hardworking.

440
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,880
I love this.

441
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,360
Why won’t you pick up the phone?

442
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,320
Are you okay?

443
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,920
Oh, I’m fine,

444
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,280
but my Hor Mok is ruined.
I won’t be able to sell them anymore.

445
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,440
I’m really sorry.

446
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,640
It's alright.

447
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,720
Here, for the damage.

448
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,760
Oh, no. I can't take that.
That’s too much.

449
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,680
It's just a small loss.

450
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,120
Just keep the money.

451
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,520
Alright.

452
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,520
Have we met before?

453
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,560
I saw you when you applied for a job

454
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,840
at Oriental Paradise Hotel, didn’t I?

455
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,400
You remember me?

456
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,440
Of course.

457
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,800
What do you do now?

458
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,120
Just selling homemade food
to families nearby. Nothing special.

459
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,000
<i>Quit it.</i>

460
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
<i>I can't.</i>

461
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,200
You have to!

462
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,760
If you don't stop it,

463
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,400
I'll send you overseas.

464
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,680
You don't want to
disappoint your mom, do you?

465
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,560
Mr. Wee.

466
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,240
You’re hiding here?
I’ve been looking all over for you!

467
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,240
If this is about Eat With Me
shutting down, I already know.

468
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,440
No, it’s bigger than that.

469
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,840
What do you mean?

470
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,160
I found out where the Mystery Chef is.

471
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,360
Looks good.

472
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,360
Smells good.

473
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,360
Delicious. It tastes good.

474
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,680
Thank you.

475
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,800
Grandma even gave a compliment.
That means you're special.

476
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,320
Is she a chef somewhere?

477
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,320
She applied to work at the hotel before.

478
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,520
What’s your name?

479
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,040
Ratree, ma’am.

480
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,960
My name is Ratree.

481
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,040
Can you cook Western dishes?

482
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,600
I can manage, if that’s what you’d like.

483
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,040
That's good. I like to be spoiled.

484
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Alright then…

485
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,080
You can start working when you’re ready.

486
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,760
Thank you.

487
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,200
I'm okay with her.

488
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,480
If you're okay, then I have no objections.

489
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,400
Alright.

490
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,440
Are you insane?!
You’re walking straight into a death trap!

491
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,560
You said it yourself.

492
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,320
It's easier to get to his bed.

493
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,400
When did I even say that?

494
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,880
But it's too risky.

495
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,360
Risk is necessary.

496
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,800
We might find the evidence
inside the house.

497
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,320
If you don’t care about yourself,
at least think about your daughters.

498
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,560
Pu.

499
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,240
Help me with something.

500
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,880
What now?

501
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,000
I think you should
give it to them yourself.

502
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,280
Does it matter who delivers it?

503
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,480
I just want to do something for my kids.

504
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,360
Sis.

505
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,680
Are you sure you won’t change your mind?

506
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
I need to do this.

507
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,440
It’s the only way I can move on
and start over with my kids.

508
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,320
Wow, everything looks delicious.

509
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,360
Did you make some extra cash today,
Uncle Pu?

510
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,200
No. Someone gave it to me.

511
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,720
A casino owner or a loan shark?

512
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,960
Neither.

513
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,480
Stop asking. Just eat it already.

514
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,240
I'm not eating.

515
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,120
They say casino food is cursed.

516
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,000
People eat it and gamble everything away.

517
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,040
No way am I taking that risk.

518
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,800
What's wrong with you.
Why are you making such a fuss?

519
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,560
I brought you good stuff.

520
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,400
I said it's not from the casino.

521
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,360
Then tell us where you got it.

522
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,000
A friend gave it to me.

523
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,240
A friend? You have friends?

524
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,520
Yeah, I do. An old friend.

525
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,160
We hadn’t seen each other in ages,

526
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,960
and we just ran into each other again.

527
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,840
This doesn’t look like casino food.

528
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,200
It looks more like hotel food.

529
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,880
Uncle Pu, do you know a chef?

530
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,680
Does it matter?

531
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,280
Just eat it.

532
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,800
The person who made it would be happy
to know it was enjoyed. I'm going.

533
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,200
Good luck running
from the cops today, Uncle!

534
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,360
- How is it?
- Very delicious!

535
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,400
Try it.

536
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,960
I've never had pasta this good before.

537
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,680
This much?

538
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,840
Yes.

539
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,400
Alright.

540
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,240
How is it?

541
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,360
What are you playing?

542
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,680
One day,

543
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,680
we’ll sit down and eat together.

544
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,520
NOT HOTEL'S PROPERTY

545
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,320
I found out where the Mystery Chef is.

546
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,240
Mr. Wee, look at this.
Can you see the reflection?

547
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,600
The condo where Eat With Me is filmed

548
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,160
must be inside the golf club estate.

549
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,400
Even if you know the condo,
you still don’t know the unit number.

550
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,560
I do. It's a corner unit.

551
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,000
There are betel palm trees
and a highway in the background.

552
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,200
I compared it to the condo photos
and the floor plan.

553
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,560
The Mystery Chef’s condo

554
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,680
is on the 8th floor, Unit 806.

555
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,080
Yes! I’m finally going to meet him!

556
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,080
That's useless.

557
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,680
What do you mean?

558
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,720
A luxury condo like that
won’t just let strangers walk in.

559
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,680
Give up, Namfah.

560
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,960
You’ll never meet him.

561
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,960
My dream's crushed.

562
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,760
I worked so hard just to get the address.

563
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,120
High-end condos

564
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,200
value their privacy.

565
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,320
The Mystery Chef probably
doesn’t want anyone to know who he is.

566
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,480
That’s why he’s so secretive.

567
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,280
He’s a chef, not a criminal.

568
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,320
What’s with all the hiding?

569
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,840
A man who cooks is cute.

570
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,280
People have their own reasons.

571
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,200
Maybe he has his.

572
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:52,120
Just like how you have a reason

573
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,120
for refusing to be Mr. Wee’s secretary
but choosing to work with Mr. Kim instead?

574
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,520
How did we go from talking
about a chef to talking about me?

575
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,320
Well, I’ve noticed that you and Mr. Kim
are always together.

576
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,720
You go everywhere together.

577
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
I bet

578
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,520
Mr. Kim has feelings for you.

579
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,080
Oh, come on.

580
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,000
Mr. Kim has plenty of options.
He wouldn’t be interested in me.

581
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,840
Then, why are you blushing?

582
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,480
Blushing? What? No! I have a deadline.

583
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,080
The client’s been chasing me for this.

584
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,720
Suspicious.

585
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,560
MR. KIMHAN

586
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,800
MR. KIMHAN

587
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,280
Yes, Mr. Kimhan?

588
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,320
You cut my call earlier today.

589
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,040
I couldn't answer at that time.

590
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,280
Then why didn’t you call back?

591
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,160
My battery died.

592
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,720
Your battery died?

593
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,000
So, charge it. You can’t even
solve that problem, Nubdao?

594
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,680
What’s so urgent that you had to call now?

595
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,720
The fact that I couldn’t reach you.
Isn’t that urgent enough?

596
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,960
How do you want me to fix this?

597
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,200
Come meet me now.

598
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,920
Now?

599
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,440
Yes. Right now.
I’m waiting outside your house.

600
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,560
What?

601
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,600
Look out your window.

602
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,280
Today’s the day.

603
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,200
I will meet him!

604
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,400
Ever since I was a kid,

605
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,400
I tried so hard to make Dad accept me.

606
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,120
But no matter how hard I tried,

607
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,920
I was still just
a worthless fool in his eyes.

608
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,960
Congratulations. You finally managed
to put yourself in the spotlight.

609
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,680
Nubdao never wanted the spotlight.

610
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,000
But if someone has to lose their light
because of it, I can't help with that.

611
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,480
Dad, you better be careful.
Once they have no use for you,

612
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,840
they’ll turn on you just like a dog
that bites the hand that feeds it.

613
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,840
Maybe the one Dad
should be careful about is the one

614
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,480
- who picks fights without thinking.
- Wee!

615
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,160
- Please, Mr. Kim.
- Let go!

616
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,760
In front of me,

617
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,520
you will not lay a hand on my son. Got it?

618
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,760
