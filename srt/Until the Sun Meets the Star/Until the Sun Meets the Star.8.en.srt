1
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,280
Who is he?

2
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,640
Finish the job.

3
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
Miss… Sis!

4
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,760
Who's this woman?

5
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,320
Maybe Mr. Aran's friend.

6
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,720
I think I have to stop doing Eat With Me.

7
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,960
Eat With Me just announced
an indefinite shutdown.

8
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
Just watch me.

9
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,920
I'll find out exactly
where the mysterious chef is.

10
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,960
These days,
good cooks are so hard to find.

11
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,880
What do you do now?

12
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,920
Just selling homemade food
to families nearby.

13
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,320
You can start working when you're ready.

14
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,920
You're walking straight into a death trap!

15
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,360
You said it yourself.
It's easier to get to his bed.

16
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,160
I've noticed that you and Mr. Kim
are always together.

17
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,640
I bet Mr. Kim has feelings for you.

18
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,040
What's so urgent that you had to call now?

19
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,560
Come meet me now. Look out your window.

20
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,920
How long have you been using this phone?

21
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,240
It may be old,
but it still works just fine.

22
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,280
Hey.

23
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Can you stop focusing on my phone already?

24
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,560
It's late now.
Shouldn't we get to the point?

25
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
How was your day?

26
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,320
I found evidence that Mr. Aran
had coronary artery disease

27
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,320
and had undergone
balloon angioplasty twice.

28
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,360
This might have been one of the reasons

29
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
he decided to take his own life.

30
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,120
That's not what I meant.

31
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,480
I meant you.

32
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,080
Me?

33
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,600
How are you doing?

34
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,400
Are you tired?

35
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm fine.

36
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,040
There's always something new
to learn each day.

37
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,960
But you didn't come all the way here
just to ask me that, did you?

38
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Tonight, I just wanted to watch the stars.

39
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,400
The clouds are too thick.
You can't see any stars.

40
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,280
I can.

41
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
What would you like for lunch?

42
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,600
I'll take care of it for you.

43
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
You care about me?

44
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,160
I thought all your thoughts
were still with Aran.

45
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,440
I have been nothing but good to you.

46
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,560
He's dead. Why bring him up?

47
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,320
Because he's been dead for years
but still manages to be a pain in my ass.

48
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,160
Excuse me.

49
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,560
Sanguansri.

50
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,920
How's the booking rate?

51
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,480
It hasn't improved, sir.
In fact, 90% of customers

52
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,920
who booked through online travel agencies

53
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,760
have canceled their reservations.

54
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,280
I think this scandal

55
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,000
has severely impacted
the hotel's reputation.

56
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,120
Well…

57
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,640
Have you considered
holding a press conference?

58
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,600
And what do you expect me to say?
I didn't kill Aran.

59
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,840
Just say "I don't know"? That's it?

60
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,680
If those keyboard warriors have proof,
then bring it the hell on.

61
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,640
Damn it.

62
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,640
What are you doing here?

63
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,600
Good morning, sir. Good morning, ma'am.

64
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,720
I invited Nubdao here
to work in my office.

65
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,200
Is that so?

66
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,280
And what exactly are you doing here?

67
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
Or did you just want a change of scenery?

68
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
To investigate--

69
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,400
I wasn't asking you. Don't butt in.

70
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
Well?

71
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,560
So, what did Kimhan ask you to do here?

72
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,720
I'm here to investigate the circumstances
surrounding Mr. Aran's death.

73
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,520
- What did you just say?
- Sir,

74
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
if we ignore this issue, the public's
suspicions about you will only grow.

75
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,400
The hotel's reputation will suffer,
and we'll continue losing customers.

76
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Who do you think you are?
And who do you think I am?

77
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,600
A mere intern has no right to lecture me.

78
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,760
Did you find any evidence?

79
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,720
I believe

80
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,760
I have discovered
the real reason behind his death.

81
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,000
I want to clarify that Mr. Aran,

82
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,000
the co-founder of Oriental Paradise,

83
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,520
died by suicide,

84
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
not murder, as rumors have suggested.

85
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,840
What about the allegations
from the Twitter account "Kill Bill"

86
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,520
that claim you were involved
in Mr. Aran's death?

87
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,680
Rumors are just rumors.

88
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,320
Anyone can say whatever they want online.

89
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,280
To this day,

90
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,920
I haven't seen a single piece
of solid evidence against me,

91
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,800
just baseless accusations

92
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,240
meant to damage my reputation.

93
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,680
So, are you saying

94
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,240
you completely deny
any involvement in his death?

95
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,800
Listen to me carefully.

96
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Aran was my best friend.

97
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,480
We went through thick and thin together

98
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,120
to build Oriental Paradise

99
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
into what it is today.

100
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
He was a good man.

101
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,600
The best friend I ever had.

102
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,520
How could I ever kill my own friend?

103
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,920
Do you have any proof

104
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,040
that he truly took his own life
and wasn't murdered?

105
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
Here it is.

106
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,640
This is Aran's will,

107
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
written before he died.

108
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,080
He refused life-extending treatments

109
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,920
that would have only prolonged
his suffering from heart disease.

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,720
Given this, it could be assumed
that Aran was suffering.

111
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,880
He didn't want to go on.

112
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
He chose to end his own life
rather than suffer from his illness

113
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
and the hotel's 400-million-baht debt

114
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
during the Tom Yum Kung financial crisis.

115
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,200
I hope this evidence

116
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,640
is enough to prove my innocence.

117
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,680
And let me make this clear.

118
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,840
Anyone who continues

119
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,560
to spread false accusations

120
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,560
or tarnish the reputation of this hotel

121
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,480
will face legal consequences.

122
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,400
No exceptions.

123
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,960
Since Mr. Aran suffered
from coronary artery disease,

124
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,480
our hotel has decided to donate,

125
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
along with medical equipment,

126
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,600
to a foundation for heart disease patients

127
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,200
worth 60 million baht.

128
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,880
This is our way of honoring

129
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,400
Mr. Aran's memory.

130
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,480
ARAN JIRACHAWALAI

131
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I've always wondered

132
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,360
if you really had heart disease.

133
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,200
I never believed that
you would take your own life.

134
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
But today,

135
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,720
the evidence Nubdao found

136
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
proves that,

137
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,800
after all this time,

138
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,280
I was wrong.

139
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,640
You were my first…

140
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,640
and only love, Aran.

141
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,520
But I had no choice.

142
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,520
I had to marry Taychit.

143
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,640
It was the best option I had back then.

144
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Thank you. Goodbye.

145
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,120
Thank you. Goodbye.

146
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,040
You must be thrilled that you managed
to restore the hotel's reputation.

147
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,400
Yes, I am.

148
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,680
Shouldn't you be happy for the hotel too?

149
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,400
You've only been here a short time,

150
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,200
yet you're already making
a name for yourself.

151
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,040
Congratulations. You've successfully
put yourself in the spotlight.

152
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,480
Nubdao doesn't seek the spotlight.

153
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,400
But if her success overshadows someone,
that's not her fault.

154
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I was just complimenting her.

155
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,240
I didn't say anything bad.

156
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,600
Don't be so defensive.

157
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,280
She's my person.

158
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,440
Of course, I'll defend her.

159
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,160
How sweet.

160
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,480
If I didn't know you,

161
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,800
I'd think she was more
than just an employee to you.

162
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,080
Maybe she is more than you think.

163
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,440
You did great today. Let's go.

164
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,160
Thank you.

165
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,920
But you shouldn't have said that
to Ms. Yada. She'll misunderstand us.

166
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,920
I wanted her to misunderstand.

167
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm not your toy.

168
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,760
You're not.

169
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,000
<i>In the end, the truth has come to light.</i>

170
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,920
<i>Mr. Aran refused medical treatment</i>

171
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,280
<i>to end his suffering from heart disease.</i>

172
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,560
<i>Today, Mr. Taychit</i>
<i>presented Mr. Aran's will</i>

173
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,640
<i>as proof of his innocence</i>

174
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,600
<i>to the press</i>

175
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,640
<i>and donated</i>

176
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,560
<i>to a heart disease foundation</i>
<i>in his memory</i>

177
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,800
<i>for 60 million baht.</i>

178
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,000
The chairman approved
your early probation clearance.

179
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,840
From now on,
you're officially a front officer

180
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,200
at Oriental Paradise.

181
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,920
You're no longer just a trainee.

182
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,160
Congratulations, Nubdao.

183
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,160
Thank you so much.

184
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,440
- Keep up the good work.
- Sure.

185
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,760
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

186
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,119
Open it.

187
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,080
I need to be able
to reach you at all times.

188
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
Thank you.

189
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm thinking
of buying a condo around here.

190
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,960
What do you think? No more long commutes.

191
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,680
I support that.

192
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,120
Condo renting is so expensive.

193
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,880
If you can finance it,

194
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,720
one day, it'll be yours.

195
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,320
Just make sure you pick wisely.
You don't want to regret it later.

196
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,640
Come with me to check it out.

197
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,320
I already called a sales agent.

198
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
- Sure, why not?
- Alright.

199
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,560
I'll treat you to a barbecue after.

200
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
We have a wide selection of units.

201
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,880
One-bedroom, two-bedroom,

202
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,200
duplex, and even penthouses.

203
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,360
Do you have a specific type in mind,
Miss Namfah?

204
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
Well, right. Can I see…

205
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,360
a unit…

206
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
on the eighth floor?

207
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,320
- Eighth floor?
- Yes, please.

208
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,520
It seems like they're all sold out.

209
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,760
Let me check.

210
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,720
I see one unit that just became available.

211
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,920
Would you like to take a look?

212
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,120
- Absolutely.
- Right this way.

213
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,160
Please.

214
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,720
Whoa, you really made it.

215
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,720
Please.

216
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,080
Our unit is on the right-hand side.

217
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,040
- This way, please.
- Alright.

218
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,200
Here we are.
This unit is absolutely stunning.

219
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,800
I guarantee you'll love it.

220
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,600
This way, please.

221
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,720
Excuse me.

222
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm thirsty. Could I get a glass of water?

223
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,120
Of course. Give me just a moment.

224
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
Thank you so much.

225
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Today is the day. I have to meet him.

226
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,600
- Namfah, wait.
- Step aside.

227
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,280
Mr. Pathawee, move.

228
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,480
Do you realize this is trespassing?

229
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,840
Mr. Pathawee, move.

230
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,120
- Think about it.
- Hey.

231
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,840
Move.

232
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,880
Namfah!

233
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,640
So? What happened next?

234
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,560
Did you meet the mystery chef?
Did you talk to him?

235
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,840
Talk to a ghost, maybe.

236
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,160
Huh? What do you mean?

237
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,760
Was he sick or something?

238
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,400
Nope…

239
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,440
Namfah!

240
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
You fainted?

241
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,760
I'm so disappointed!

242
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,160
I had the perfect plan.
I was this close to seeing him.

243
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,480
And then everything was ruined.

244
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,680
So, you fainted,
and Mr. Pathawee brought you home?

245
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,880
We were so close.

246
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,280
Just a single breath away.

247
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,040
And yet fate denied me once again.

248
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,520
Hey, don't worry.
There's always next time.

249
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,320
Next time? I'm already embarrassed enough.
I can't even

250
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,040
look Mr. Pathawee in the eye anymore.

251
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,760
Poor you.

252
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
Are you going to tell me

253
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,680
who that girl was?

254
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,040
A hotel staff member. Her name is Namfah.

255
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,160
She's obsessed with the mystery chef
from Eat With Me.

256
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,320
And why didn't you just tell her
that you are the mystery chef?

257
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,080
Because I don't want people to know
that I run that page.

258
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,120
Only you and I know about this.

259
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,440
Okay, but what if she doesn't give up?

260
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,920
I have no idea.

261
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,880
You could just tell her.

262
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,480
You're the king
of making simple things complicated.

263
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,760
Don't you have enough drama in your life?

264
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,120
I came here for advice, not criticism.

265
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,240
Don't worry, sweetie. I support you.

266
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,400
Now, let's go snuggle
under the blankets, shall we?

267
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,960
Enough. Just go and close the door.

268
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,720
Stop overcomplicating things.

269
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,640
Alright.

270
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,120
You know,
this is your daughter's favorite dish.

271
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,320
If something happens to me,
please take care of Nubdao and Namfah.

272
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
What are you saying?

273
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,720
My daughters are the only thing
that matters to me.

274
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,880
And I trust you'll protect them.

275
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,120
Why so dramatic?

276
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,760
Your daughters are like my own.

277
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,640
I practically raised them.

278
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,160
I would never let anything happen to them.

279
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Just eat.

280
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
This is the best.

281
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,680
Hey! Miss!

282
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,440
Don't throw up!

283
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
Not in my car!

284
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,520
Did you hear me?

285
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,000
- Stop!
- How did you get in here?

286
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,520
Get out!

287
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,200
Get out!

288
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,440
You sure have a strong arm.

289
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
I thought you were some psycho.

290
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,360
That's what I get for carrying you
all the way here so you could sleep?

291
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,240
- You carried me?
- That's right.

292
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
That was fast. Here, here, here.

293
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
Hey!

294
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,680
Hey.

295
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,040
Don't throw up in my car.

296
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,600
My car, seats, carpets, everything,

297
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,360
is completely covered in your vomit.
It reeks.

298
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,720
How much?
Just tell me the cost for cleaning.

299
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,600
I'll pay for it. Stop talking about this.

300
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,840
I don't like owing anyone.

301
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,320
Five thousand?
Okay, give me your account number.

302
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,360
Fifty thousand.

303
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,360
Are you insane?
What kind of car wash costs 50,000?

304
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,800
It's an imported model.
You think deep cleaning it is cheap?

305
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,600
I'm not paying for that.

306
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,360
If you want money so badly,
go ahead and sue me.

307
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,280
Hey. Wait.

308
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
At least tell me your name.

309
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,960
How can I sue you?

310
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,960
Who is that?

311
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,240
Aunt Sai said Ms. Jitree

312
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,240
hired a new cook
to replace the one who left.

313
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,960
Her name is Ratree.

314
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,400
And who gave permission for that?

315
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,720
This house is mine.

316
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,680
Who do they think they are, bringing in
someone new without even telling me?

317
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,080
Do I even matter anymore?

318
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,920
I was just about to tell you.

319
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
Did you even check her background?
What if she's a thief?

320
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,920
You're being paranoid.

321
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,920
Stop right there.

322
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,560
Ever since your grandma moved in here,

323
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,120
you've been acting just like your mother.

324
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,800
One day, you'll end up pregnant
with no father in sight.

325
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,600
Don't say things like that. They say

326
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,360
parents' words hold power.
Your children will get

327
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,560
what you say.

328
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,360
Wait.

329
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,880
Where were you all night?

330
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,560
I'm tired of this house
and the people in it.

331
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
If you're so miserable here,

332
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,720
why don't you just move out?

333
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,080
I'd be stupid if I did that.

334
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,240
Some people have been here
for over 20 years,

335
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,480
yet you never kicked them out.

336
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,840
Why is that?

337
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,880
Because I love them.

338
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,200
Dad,

339
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,720
did you ever

340
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,800
even love me and Kim

341
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,440
like you do them?

342
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,280
He doesn't.

343
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,240
Because all of his love
was stolen by them.

344
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
That's not true.

345
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
It absolutely is.

346
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,680
Are you stupid or just pretending?

347
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,440
Huh?

348
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,960
Do all mistresses pretend
to be clueless like this?

349
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,680
And do all self-righteous first wives
who keep pressing other people

350
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,640
think they're smart?

351
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Absolutely.

352
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,440
Your mother once trampled
all over my mother's heart.

353
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,640
Now, I'll make you feel exactly
what she felt.

354
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,560
I'll return everything,
every single wound she suffered.

355
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,720
Let's see how long you
and your mother can endure.

356
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,240
Kimhan, what nonsense are you spouting?

357
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,760
Is the truth too painful?

358
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,920
Or has your new wife brainwashed you
so well that you've forgotten

359
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
you had a family before?

360
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,760
But then, a shameless woman
with no morals seduced you,

361
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,920
using her tricks to steal everything.

362
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,880
Oh, Dad, be careful, though.

363
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,560
Once you're no longer useful,

364
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,080
she might turn on you like a stray dog,
biting the hand that once fed it.

365
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,320
Don't worry.

366
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,680
My mom and I never forget
the kindness we've received.

367
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,720
The real problem

368
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,160
is people who pick fights
with everyone without thinking.

369
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,600
Wee!

370
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
- Kim.
- Let go!

371
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,400
Don't touch me.

372
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,680
Mom!

373
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,000
In my presence,
you have no right to harm my son.

374
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,440
Do you understand?

375
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
And in my presence,

376
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,080
you have no right
to lay a hand on my grandson.

377
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Are you alright?

378
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,120
How did Ms. Sasi end up with Taychit?

379
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,280
I'm sorry, Mom. I wasn't patient enough.

380
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
If they insult me, I can take it.

381
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,360
But when they disrespect you,
I just can't stand it.

382
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,680
Come on.

383
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,080
Let's not make things worse, okay?

384
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,080
I don't understand.

385
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,920
Why have you endured and given in
to them for over 20 years?

386
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,280
All this time,

387
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,960
I've given in where I could.

388
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,160
And as for the bad things,
I chose not to hold onto them.

389
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,400
The more you hold grudges,
the more pain you carry.

390
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,760
But they've treated us horribly, Mom.

391
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,680
Maybe we're the ones

392
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,000
who have wronged them.

393
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,920
Try to understand them.

394
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,640
If you can yield, then yield.

395
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,000
But how much longer

396
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,960
do we have to endure and give in?

397
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,000
I don't know.

398
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,920
All I know is

399
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,280
we have to endure for as long as we can.

400
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,800
In my presence,
you have no right to harm my son.

401
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,480
Do you understand?

402
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,360
Dad, I want to go to the amusement park.
I want to ride the carousel.

403
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,000
Go tell your mom.

404
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,960
My sweet boy. It's okay, honey.

405
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,600
Your dad is just busy.

406
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,840
Tell you what.

407
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,280
I'll take you instead.

408
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
- Are you having fun, sweetheart?
- Yes, Mom!

409
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,480
Make sure all the playground equipment
is thoroughly inspected, Nubdao.

410
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,480
We need to ensure the children's safety,
especially the carousel.

411
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,920
Understood.

412
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,320
Please take care of it.

413
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,240
Of course. I'll make sure
everything is well taken care of.

414
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,800
When I was a kid, my mom
once took me to ride a carousel.

415
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,080
I remember feeling
incredibly happy back then.

416
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,280
What about you?

417
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
What was your happiest childhood memory?

418
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,080
For me,

419
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
it was folding paper bags with my sister.

420
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,280
<i>The more we folded,</i>
<i>the more pocket money we earned.</i>

421
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,280
Yay!

422
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,720
I'm done!

423
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,360
Wow, great job, sweetie!

424
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,720
- I'm not done yet.
- Come on. Let's eat.

425
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,240
Let's eat.

426
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,400
It smells good.

427
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
Take a big bite.

428
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,640
Open your mouth.

429
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,760
Is it good?

430
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,840
<i>Sometimes, happiness</i>

431
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,280
<i>was as simple as playing with soap bubbles</i>
<i>while washing dishes.</i>

432
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,760
- Don't be too fast.
- Are you a professional?

433
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,160
I do it every day.

434
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,520
- Nubdao is a professional.
- I can't catch up.

435
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,320
Scrub well! Quick, quick!

436
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,120
Clean it well and send it over.

437
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,720
It's not clean.

438
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,280
Keep going. Good job.

439
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,400
Or maybe it was competing with my sister
to collect plastic bottles

440
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,160
and selling them for ice cream money.

441
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,080
- I got one, Uncle Pu.
- Let me see.

442
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,560
Well done, Namfah.

443
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,040
Nubdao too.

444
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,000
Let's go get some ice cream to celebrate!

445
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,880
Let's eat ice cream.

446
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,640
One more bite, okay?

447
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,200
It's so refreshing.

448
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,680
It's just one bite.

449
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
Here it is!

450
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,720
It's so cold.

451
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,160
Come on.

452
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,760
Your childhood sounds really tough.

453
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,720
Not at all.

454
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,960
When I look back,

455
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,640
I realize my sister and I
were actually quite happy.

456
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,480
Mr. Kimhan,
is there anything else you need?

457
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,960
Yes.

458
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,120
Got it. I'll do as you say.

459
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,640
Talking to your boyfriend, sweetie?

460
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,920
It's just a friend, Mom.

461
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,240
No need to hide it from me.

462
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,800
Your father already told me everything.

463
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,000
What exactly did Father tell you?

464
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,800
He mentioned your friend, Talay.

465
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,200
The world has moved forward, honey.

466
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,240
It doesn't matter to me who you love.

467
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,200
I'm fine with that.

468
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,960
It doesn't matter
if it's a man or a woman,

469
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,840
as long as they're a good person.

470
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,200
Wait, you and Father think that I…

471
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,600
No, Mother. You've got it all wrong.

472
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,440
Talay is just my best friend.

473
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,680
The person I like is a woman.

474
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,720
She's beautiful, well-mannered,

475
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,640
and kind.

476
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,560
If you meet her,
you'll definitely love her too.

477
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,240
Well then, bring her home for me
to meet sometime.

478
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,880
Of course, Mom.

479
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,360
GET READY FOR THE RETURN OF EAT WITH ME…
COMING SOON!

480
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,200
Oh, it's you!

481
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
What's going on, Namfah?

482
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,400
The Eat With Me page!
The Mystery Chef is coming back!

483
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,280
I have to like and share it right now!

484
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,480
It's just a chef.
Is it really that exciting?

485
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,160
You don't get it
because you're not in the fandom.

486
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,280
Such a shame…

487
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,880
If I hadn't passed out that day,

488
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,120
I would've seen his face by now.

489
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
He might not be
what you imagine him to be.

490
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,800
Right. Who would be as perfect as you?

491
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,560
Have you been to an amusement park before?

492
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,360
- No, I haven't.
- Then, let me take you.

493
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,960
Want to try that together?

494
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,200
What are we waiting for?

495
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,000
How about this one?

496
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,080
One more round?

497
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,000
Let me catch my breath first.

498
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,760
You didn't enjoy it?

499
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,760
I did,

500
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,600
but you seemed to enjoy it
even more than I did.

501
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,000
Well, it's my first time
at an amusement park.

502
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,240
Maybe you were waiting
for me to bring you here.

503
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,000
This cake takes months
to order in advance.

504
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,800
Please try it, Ms. Sanguansri.

505
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,680
Thank you, but there's no need.

506
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,280
I could buy it myself.

507
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,080
Please accept it.

508
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,080
You work so hard every day.
You don't even have time to buy it.

509
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,360
The chairman always speaks highly of you.

510
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,760
What does the chairman say about me?

511
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,760
He says there's no one in this hotel
as dedicated as you.

512
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,640
- Really?
- Yes.

513
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,400
I think I should take you
as my role model.

514
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,560
I'm just doing my job.

515
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,760
Is Mr. Kimhan not working today?

516
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,320
He came in but went out for something.

517
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,640
Where did he go?

518
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,120
That's his personal business.

519
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,760
I actually have
some documents for him to sign.

520
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,680
How urgent?

521
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,400
I can take care of it for you.

522
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,880
Where did he disappear to?

523
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,120
Thank you so much.

524
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,320
You know,

525
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,960
my life is no different from a carousel.

526
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,040
It looks like I'm moving forward,

527
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,960
but in reality, I'm just going in circles.

528
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,320
Ever since I was a kid,

529
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,960
I tried everything
to make my father proud.

530
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,280
But no matter what I did,

531
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,280
I was always just a failure in his eyes.

532
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,840
The only reason I keep going

533
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,880
is that I want to prove him wrong.

534
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,040
Mr. Kimhan, look at this.

535
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,120
What is it?

536
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,800
The carousel we're on.

537
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,200
It keeps going up and down.

538
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,880
And?

539
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,240
Life is just

540
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,520
like this carousel.

541
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,720
It has its ups and downs,

542
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,480
happiness and sadness,

543
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,320
spinning in cycles.

544
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,720
The more hardships we endure,

545
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,720
the closer we are to happiness.

546
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,320
My father used to tell me that.

547
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,920
So, I don't hold onto the past

548
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,120
or worry about the future.

549
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,040
I just focus on living in the present.
That's enough.

550
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,360
Nubdao…

551
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,680
Your name is beautiful.
Who gave it to you?

552
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't really know.

553
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,400
Maybe my mom.

554
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,840
She passed away when I was little.

555
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,360
My father never talked about her.

556
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,960
I've never even seen
a single picture of her.

557
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,520
I'm sorry.

558
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,680
I didn't mean
to bring up something painful.

559
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,080
No need to apologize.

560
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,160
It's the truth.

561
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,560
What about your name?

562
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,320
My mom named me.

563
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,840
"Kimhan" means "summer".

564
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,520
She wanted my life to be

565
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,600
as bright and warm as the summer sun.

566
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,640
Do you think

567
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,320
I give off that kind of warmth?

568
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,200
I think you're more like the evening sun.

569
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,600
The sun that's about to set…

570
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,280
Doesn't that seem

571
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,240
a bit lonely and sad?

572
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,200
But I see it as the last warm light

573
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,760
that embraces the little stars at night.

574
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,400
When the sun sets,

575
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,080
it's time for the stars to shine,

576
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,480
isn't it?

577
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,720
Okay.

578
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,200
Tell the messenger to wait there.
I'll be out soon.

579
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,080
Is something wrong?

580
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,360
Ms. Sanguansri has some
urgent documents for me to sign.

581
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,640
But I can take care of it later.

582
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,160
Alright. Heal quickly!

583
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,320
And from now on,
forget about the painful past,

584
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,040
little scar.

585
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,040
If you plan to stay here,

586
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,520
you better know who you have to obey.

587
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,720
Don't think your so-called boss

588
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,840
can protect you forever.

589
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,200
I never thought Taychit would take
his best friend's lover as his wife.

590
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,040
Come on, sis.
These things don't happen one-sided.

591
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,560
The woman must have been willing too.

592
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,600
You want this?

593
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,400
A French wooden cutting board
signed by the chef?

594
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,640
How did you get this, Mr. Pathawee?

595
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,840
If you come to this restaurant,
you must try this dish,

596
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,440
"Two-Hearted Seabass".

597
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,720
