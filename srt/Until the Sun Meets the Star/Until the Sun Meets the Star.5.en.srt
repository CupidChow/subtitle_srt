1
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,080
This is delicious! It's not bad at all.

2
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,040
I have a meeting at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

3
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,520
<i>I want you to bring my coffee</i>
<i>to the main conference room.</i>

4
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,800
Nubdao! We're in the middle of a meeting!

5
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,480
- Who gave you permission to come in?
- I did.

6
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,080
This year, we're only allowed
to hire one kitchen helper.

7
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,640
Who's writing the exam?

8
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,360
I am.

9
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Mr. Pathawee?

10
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm Mr. Wee's secretary.

11
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to know his secrets.

12
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,840
What's in it for me?

13
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,520
Anything you want.

14
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,880
Deal.

15
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,760
Give this to my children.
Ten thousand baht.

16
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,480
Starting tomorrow,
you'll be working for me.

17
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,680
Doesn't matter whether you agree or not.

18
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,520
You have to follow my orders either way.

19
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
Why did you send me this video?

20
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,120
Didn't you ask me
to dig into your brother's secrets?

21
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,400
Hello!

22
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,880
Mr. Lay!

23
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,240
I was just thinking about you.

24
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,440
I know. That's why I came.

25
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,640
The secret about Wee liking men?

26
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,600
That’s nonsense.
What century are we living in?

27
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,080
Whether he likes men or women
is none of my business.

28
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm not going to play dirty

29
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,280
and attack him
over something so petty. It's dumb.

30
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,800
But if the chairman finds out,

31
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,960
he might not be pleased.

32
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
You got anything…

33
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,720
more interesting than this?

34
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,280
I suspect Mr. Pathawee

35
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
and his so-called "friend" Talay

36
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
are up to something suspicious.

37
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
And what proof do you have?

38
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,120
None yet.

39
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,160
Then your job's not done, Yada.

40
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,800
You used to be better than this.

41
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm planning to demolish
the small guest house and replace it

42
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,440
with a waterfall garden.
It'll make the house feel more peaceful.

43
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,920
But the guest house
is still in good condition.

44
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Wouldn't it be a waste to tear it down?

45
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,760
The feng shui master says
having a waterfall there

46
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,160
will be good.

47
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,280
Money flowing in like water.

48
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,000
Besides,

49
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,320
I don't want to keep that place.
It's an eyesore.

50
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Still, you should consult the kids first.

51
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,920
That house belonged to their mother.

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Not necessary.
I'm the head of this family.

53
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,320
I make the decisions.
Who's more important than me?

54
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,280
Today marks another year
since your mother passed.

55
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
Do you think Taychit even remembers?

56
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Dream on, Grandma.

57
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,360
Since Mom died,

58
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,160
I've never once seen Dad
make merit for her.

59
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,480
That's because

60
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,360
he never considered
your mother his real wife.

61
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,200
He’s never even seen you
as his real children.

62
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,000
Now that Pathawee is back,

63
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
you two are nothing more
than stray dogs to him.

64
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,680
Before long, your father
will give everything to him.

65
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,200
Look,

66
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,400
Pathawee comes back

67
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,080
and Kim gets kicked out of the house.

68
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,680
Next, it'll be you, Tawan.

69
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
That man is so drunk on his own arrogance,

70
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
he’s forgotten

71
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
that your mother
was once his devoted wife.

72
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,640
Now, all he cares about

73
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,560
is that mistress and her son.

74
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,400
But don't worry.

75
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,720
I'll remind him exactly who he used to be.

76
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,800
Tawan, help me pack.

77
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes, Grandma.

78
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,040
This is gonna be fun.

79
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,880
Here.

80
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,920
This is Kwao Krua Daeng.
Steep it in liquor

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,320
and give it to the boss. He’ll be yours.

82
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,600
Are you sure about this, Mom?

83
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,200
Come on. Don’t be stupid.

84
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
Or would you rather see him
in another woman’s bed?

85
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
Take it.

86
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Mom, what if he eats it

87
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,320
and something happens to him?

88
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,160
Of course, something will happen.

89
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,159
That’s the whole point.

90
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,240
Mom!

91
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,240
It will just arouse him.

92
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Don't worry. I won't kill him.

93
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,960
If you want him to be your husband,
you have to trust me.

94
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
Take it.

95
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
Good afternoon.

96
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Are you disappointed

97
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,400
to see me still alive

98
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,320
and not dead like Jitsuda?

99
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,480
Are you here to visit your grandchildren
or just to antagonize me?

100
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
Neither.

101
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,400
Since it's my daughter's
death anniversary,

102
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,640
I thought I'd do something for her.

103
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
What are you planning to do?

104
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,880
Grandma's moving in.
She’s part of this household now.

105
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,720
You think this house is a hotel?

106
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,840
You can't just waltz in
whenever you please.

107
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,560
You never asked us when you moved in
your mistress and her son, did you?

108
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
This is my house. I’ll do whatever I want.

109
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Then this house

110
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
has always been a hotel,

111
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,480
complete with a bed

112
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
and a woman to serve you.

113
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,800
Shut up, Promtawan.

114
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,880
Oh, don't worry.

115
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,080
I won't be a burden

116
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,520
under your roof.

117
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,520
I'll stay in the small guest house
where Jitsuda spent her final days.

118
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,960
I won't interfere with you
and your mistress enjoying your life.

119
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
Oh.

120
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
And I hope

121
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,080
you haven't forgotten.

122
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,600
This house

123
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,440
may belong to you,

124
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,040
but the land belongs to me.

125
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's go.

126
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,240
Grandma, are you sure

127
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,320
you don't want to stay in the main house?

128
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,120
No. I won't step foot into that house
and waste my energy.

129
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,080
If your mother could live here,

130
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,080
why can't I?

131
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,360
It's so satisfying just thinking about
how furious Dad and his mistress

132
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,120
must be that you're moving in.

133
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,480
I bet they nearly choked on their rage.
Serves them right!

134
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,560
This is nothing compared
to what they did to your mother.

135
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
Those two

136
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,640
probably want me gone.

137
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,640
They can keep dreaming.

138
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,840
I'll make sure they’re never happy

139
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,280
until the day I die.

140
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
I heard

141
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,160
Dad plans to appoint Pathawee
as the next chairman.

142
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,160
Is that true, Kim?

143
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
Never underestimate your enemies.

144
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,760
They could be plotting
against you right now,

145
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,040
and you'd never even know it.

146
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,680
No matter what they plan,
I will be the next chairman.

147
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,120
Don't worry, Grandma.

148
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,520
Having Mrs. Jitree move in
might not be such a bad thing.

149
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,640
At least Kimhan and Promtawan
will have someone to look after them.

150
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,120
You don't know her like I do.

151
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,920
She's vengeful.

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,640
Let me tell you.
She's far more dangerous than you think.

153
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,600
Maybe she's just hurting

154
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,720
from losing her daughter.

155
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,120
Try to understand her.

156
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Some people are like cobras.

157
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,560
If you let them into your home,

158
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,600
they'll bite you.

159
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,360
Mr. Taychit,

160
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,560
you never see the good in people, do you?

161
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,840
Just wait and see.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

162
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,280
The best thing you can do

163
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,360
is stay away from her.

164
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,120
Uncle Pu.

165
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
There's food in the fridge.

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,520
Alright.

167
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,840
Here's the money I borrowed from you.

168
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
Every last baht.

169
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
Ten thousand baht?

170
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,880
Uncle Pu,

171
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
you stole 10,000 baht from us?

172
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,560
And what's with all that food?

173
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,520
Nothing. My customer just bailed on me.

174
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
Where did you even get this money?

175
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,080
That’s none of your business.

176
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,680
Just know that I’ve paid you back

177
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,560
every single baht, interest included.

178
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,200
Not one baht short. That's all.

179
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,720
Just wait a little longer, my dear.

180
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,480
Sis! Sis!

181
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,160
I barely recognized you!

182
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,960
If even you can't recognize me,

183
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,560
then there's no way Taychit will.

184
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,320
He's never met me before.

185
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,160
Sis!

186
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
Take a deep breath.

187
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,040
Don’t focus on competing with others.
Just beat your own limits

188
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,560
Thank you, Nubdao.

189
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,800
Good luck, Namfah.

190
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,920
I'll head to work now.

191
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,520
Alright, candidates,
please enter the examination room.

192
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,640
I'm so sorry!

193
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,840
Are you okay?

194
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I'm fine. Thank you.

195
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,840
Alright.

196
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,560
- You are…
- I'm Fah. Namfah.

197
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,880
Namfah?

198
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,520
- Alright. Thank you.
- Sure.

199
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,240
After you, Auntie.

200
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,680
Alright, everyone. You may begin.

201
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
WHICH PART OF AN ANIMAL IS "GÉSIERS"?

202
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,160
Gésiers? What animal part is that?

203
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,400
What does it mean in French?

204
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,760
Spleen, spinal cord, stomach, or brain?

205
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,480
<i>This French dish</i>

206
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,880
<i>is like a poultry medley,</i>

207
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,480
<i>using ingredients from chicken,</i>

208
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,280
<i>turkey, duck, and goose.</i>
<i>The term "gésiers"</i>

209
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,160
<i>simply means "gizzard",</i>
<i>a thick-walled part</i>

210
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,760
<i>of a bird's digestive tract</i>
<i>that helps grind food</i>

211
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,200
<i>using small stones or grit.</i>

212
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,000
<i>It's essentially</i>
<i>the bird's equivalent of a stomach.</i>

213
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,640
Time's up. Please put your pens down.

214
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,680
Your test results

215
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
will be emailed to you by midnight.

216
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
Candidates who pass the written exam
must return for the practical exam

217
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,800
at the designated date and time.

218
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,160
If you don't appear,
you'll forfeit your candidacy.

219
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,600
The test was so hard.

220
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,880
There were so many questions
I wasn't sure about.

221
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,920
Cooking requires
both skill and experience.

222
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,520
You need to keep practicing,
experimenting with new things constantly.

223
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,960
Why did you apply
for a kitchen helper position?

224
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,440
I think

225
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,520
you seem more qualified to be a chef.

226
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,840
If given the chance, I'd love to be.

227
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,560
But right now, I'm not skilled enough yet.

228
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Namfah.

229
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,120
How did it go?

230
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,560
Auntie,

231
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,920
this is my sister, Nubdao.

232
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
Hello.

233
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
Namfah… Nubdao…

234
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,680
You two are sisters?

235
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,840
Yes.

236
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,000
I see. I should get going now.

237
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,040
Hopefully, we'll meet again.

238
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,960
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

239
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,960
Who's that man?

240
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,400
That's Chairman Taychit,
the owner of this place.

241
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,120
You mean Mr. Kimhan
and Mr. Pathawee's father?

242
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,720
Whoa, he looks intense.

243
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,520
Golden rule here.
Never gossip about the boss.

244
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,160
By the way, do you know
who set the exam questions?

245
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,960
Why do you want to know that?

246
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,920
Mr. Pathawee?

247
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,640
I wrote the exam questions.

248
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,120
It was brutal!

249
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,840
Tougher than
the university entrance exams!

250
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,120
- Were you trying to eliminate us all?
- Namfah!

251
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,760
Anything that's hard to achieve has value.

252
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,200
Every industry needs the best of the best.

253
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,440
I want to work with people who have
passion and dedication for cooking.

254
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,520
I assume you think so too.
That's why you applied, right?

255
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,960
I understand now.

256
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,880
I really hope I make it to the top five

257
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
who pass this round.

258
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
Excuse me. I have to go.

259
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,720
Nubdao,

260
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,960
where are you going?
Lunch break isn't even over yet.

261
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
A new video just dropped from Eat with Me!

262
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,280
You follow that channel?

263
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,600
I'm the ultimate fangirl!

264
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,720
If he ever has a fan meeting or event,
I'd be the first in line.

265
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,600
I'm dying to meet the admin in person!

266
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,520
He's just a chef, not a superstar.
Why would you want to meet him?

267
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,200
He’s the reason I want to become a chef.

268
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,040
I just want to meet him once
to say thank you.

269
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,040
Honestly, in the exam, I got
a question right because of his videos.

270
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,520
Really? Which question?

271
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,200
I wouldn’t tell you.

272
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,400
Do you realize what you did wrong?

273
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,120
What do you mean? What did I do wrong?

274
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,960
Can't you figure it out yourself?

275
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,320
Are you mad because

276
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,280
I talked to Mr. Pathawee?

277
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,480
Relax. I’m fine.
Wee is already dating someone.

278
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,800
Yes, and?

279
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
I mean, who you talk to

280
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,040
is none of my business.

281
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,920
Why would I care?

282
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,360
Then, what are you mad about?

283
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,920
I already told you.

284
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,880
You work under me. You need
to report to me about everything.

285
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,520
I haven't seen you all morning.

286
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,760
I was planning to report to you
this afternoon.

287
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Too late. I want updates in real-time.

288
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,640
So petty.

289
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,680
I heard that.

290
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,440
Nothing. Your "orders"

291
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,040
are law, so, of course, I'll follow them.

292
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,080
Good.

293
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,240
I don't like people disobeying me.

294
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,720
YOUNGER HENS
OLDER HENS

295
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,280
<i>Eggs from younger hens</i>

296
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,760
<i>are smaller than those from older hens</i>

297
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
<i>but richer in nutrients.</i>

298
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,280
<i>Their egg whites</i>
<i>are thicker and more flavorful.</i>

299
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
<i>When cracked open, they look like this.</i>

300
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,080
<i>Meanwhile, eggs from older hens</i>

301
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,000
<i>have more liquid whites,</i>
<i>making them runnier.</i>

302
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,480
<i>They also tend to splatter more</i>
<i>when fried, and the taste is not as rich.</i>

303
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,880
So? Did they send the results yet?

304
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,760
Not yet.

305
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,920
It's almost midnight though.

306
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,680
The email is here!

307
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,920
Open it now.

308
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,840
Well? Did you pass?

309
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,560
HELPER CHEF RESULT
CONGRATULATIONS TO MS. NAMFAH

310
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I passed!

311
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,520
I passed!

312
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,560
Well done!

313
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,840
Let's dance!

314
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,960
Be careful.

315
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,880
My daughters…

316
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,520
How are they doing?

317
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,760
Do they cry a lot? Are they fussy eaters?

318
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,720
How are they?

319
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,800
Nubdao and Namfah don't cry much.

320
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,080
They're easygoing. Don't worry.

321
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,040
Right now,

322
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,360
I'm looking for a top lawyer to help you.

323
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,560
Just hold on a little longer, Mirantee.

324
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,240
My babies…

325
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,760
I'm so sorry.

326
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,360
I truly had no idea.
I didn't know anything.

327
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,360
I need to ask you something.

328
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,240
Please promise me.

329
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,560
What is it? Just tell me.

330
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
Don't tell them

331
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,560
their mother's name was Mirantee.

332
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,600
Don't tell them.

333
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,760
Why?

334
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,800
I'm scared for them.

335
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,720
I don't want them dragged into this.

336
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,640
If they find out

337
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,520
these two are my children,

338
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,560
they won't let them go.

339
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,480
Please promise me. Don't tell them.

340
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,200
Please.

341
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,760
But what if they grow up

342
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,920
and ask? What should I tell them?

343
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,240
Tell them…

344
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,440
Tell them their mother's name was Daoruang

345
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,880
and that she died.

346
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,040
Please,

347
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,040
promise me.

348
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,680
Alright…

349
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,800
I'll do as you say.

350
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,320
No one will ever know that these two

351
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,560
are your children.

352
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,400
Their mother's name is Daoruang,

353
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,080
and she is gone.

354
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,120
When is Mom coming home?

355
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,640
I just want to hold my babies…

356
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,640
Weha…

357
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,760
Where is Weha?

358
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,480
Where is he, Pu? Where is he?

359
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,040
Pu!

360
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,600
Weha is dead.

361
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,520
Weha…

362
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,480
Weha…

363
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,520
EXPOSING THE COVER-UP MURDER OF…

364
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,040
EXPOSING THE COVER-UP MURDER
OF ORIENTAL PARADISE'S FOUNDER

365
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,240
HOPE THE MURDERER ROTS IN HELL

366
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,880
DON'T LET THE MURDERER GET AWAY WITH IT

367
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,880
EXPOSING THE COVER-UP MURDER
OF ORIENTAL PARADISE'S FOUNDER (KILL BILL)

368
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,760
DON'T LET THE CRIMINAL GO UNPUNISHED

369
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,960
MORE DRAMATIC THAN A SOAP OPERA

370
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,160
THE WORLD IS GETTING SCARIER

371
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,720
I know everyone is worried,

372
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,560
but what do you expect me to do?

373
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,680
Some internet troll
made up this entire story.

374
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,800
Regardless of whether it's true or not,

375
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,600
this scandal is damaging
the hotel's reputation.

376
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,880
Most shareholders are upset. Some
are even considering selling their shares.

377
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,160
We need to do something.
We can't let this spiral out of control.

378
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,080
Then tell me. What do you suggest? Anyone?

379
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,520
I think we should hold a press conference

380
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,000
to clear things up
and confirm that Mr. Aran's death

381
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,240
was a suicide, not murder.

382
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,600
I didn’t expect this to be all
the vice president could think of.

383
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,960
If you're not going to help,
don't be a nuisance.

384
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,440
I am helping. Let's not forget.

385
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,600
I own shares in this hotel too.

386
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,160
Then, tell us what you think
will solve this problem, Mr. Kimhan.

387
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,920
We're listening.

388
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,560
A press conference
will only invite more scrutiny.

389
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,080
It could escalate into digging
into executives' personal matters.

390
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,760
Reporters love scandals,
especially dirty secrets.

391
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,280
But ignoring it

392
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,080
will only fuel more speculation.

393
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,080
There's news every day.
People will soon forget.

394
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,000
Fake news is just that. Fake.

395
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,400
Why panic if it's not true?

396
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,520
But if we stay silent,

397
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,240
the accuser might get bolder
and strike again.

398
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,440
Then, why do we even have
a legal department?

399
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,840
False information spread online
falls under the Computer Crimes Act.

400
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,760
We could also file
criminal defamation charges.

401
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,200
The ones fabricating
these stories for attention

402
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,680
should be the ones scared.
Don’t you agree, Chairman?

403
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,040
I don't agree with this approach.
Instead of addressing the scandal,

404
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,720
they're acting like nothing happened.

405
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,600
But I think the chairman
and Mr. Kimhan made the right decision.

406
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,440
Even though Mr. Aran
and the chairman were best friends

407
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
and co-founded the hotel,

408
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,480
there were rumors
of bad blood between them.

409
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,480
Bad blood over what?

410
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Love.

411
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,680
Are you worried about something?

412
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
Today is the anniversary
of my mother's death,

413
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,120
and my father didn't even visit.

414
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,600
He never does.
You should be used to it by now.

415
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,080
I am,

416
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,480
but it still hurts.

417
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,360
I just found out from Grandma
that my father stole his friend's wife.

418
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
My life…

419
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,600
Such a joke.

420
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,080
Mr. Taychit and Mr. Aran
were in love with the same woman.

421
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,800
Who told you that?

422
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,200
No one.

423
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,600
I read about it
in a celebrity gossip column.

424
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,840
I think the chairman
doesn't want the media

425
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,240
digging up his past affairs.

426
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,760
That's why he chooses to stay silent.

427
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,560
And what about the claims
that Mr. Aran's shot himself?

428
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,000
If you really want to know,
maybe you should ask the chairman himself.

429
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,880
I'd rather not.

430
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,520
My father’s already under enough stress.

431
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,720
Reputation can be rebuilt.

432
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,640
People forget quickly. By now,
they've probably already moved on.

433
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,760
But the other shareholders
haven't forgotten.

434
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,120
That's unfortunate.
If they are shaken by this nonsense,

435
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,440
then they can sell their shares.

436
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,600
I'll buy them all. That way,
I can have the majority vote on the board.

437
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,400
Come on, Mr. Kim. You're joking, right?

438
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,840
Business is just a game.
There are winners and losers.

439
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,360
Only those who read the game correctly
get to stay in it.

440
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,400
Vietnamese iced coffee
with Kahlúa for Mr. Kimhan.

441
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,080
Am I interrupting something?

442
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,560
People barging in like this… No manners.

443
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,520
I hate…

444
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,160
this kind of behavior.

445
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,400
I apologize.

446
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,240
I ordered it myself. Come in.

447
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,680
You remind me
of the coffee village in Vietnam,

448
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Jung Nguyen.

449
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,600
The coffee there is bitter,

450
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,120
sharp, but has a rich aroma.

451
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,720
One sip, and you're instantly awake.

452
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,880
So, is that a good thing or not?

453
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,440
Of course, it’s good.

454
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,320
You brewed it just like the original.

455
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,720
Have you ever tried
Vietnamese coffee before?

456
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,320
No, I just watched some YouTube videos
and followed the steps.

457
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,880
The rest, I just imagined
how it would taste.

458
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,360
Well then, I'll take you
to try the real thing someday.

459
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,760
Would you like to go with me?

460
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,200
I'm afraid of getting airsick.

461
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,600
I'm giving you half a day off today.

462
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,600
What?

463
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,560
Your sister passed
the written exam, didn't she?

464
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,320
The final practical test
is this afternoon.

465
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,880
You should be there to support her.

466
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,600
You knew about that?

467
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,200
There's nothing in this hotel
that I don't know.

468
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,800
Wish your sister luck for me.

469
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,640
Thank you.

470
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,280
Do you know

471
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,600
who's behind this?

472
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,400
They're using the alias "Kill Bill".

473
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,800
I tracked the IP address.

474
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,760
It was posted from an internet café.

475
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,160
Get me that person.

476
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,440
I want to know who they are
and what the hell they want.

477
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,600
Understood, sir.

478
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,640
- You're really going to compete?
- I have to.

479
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,040
But Namfah really wants this job.

480
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,680
If you enter, there's no way she'll win.

481
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,920
Are you really going to crush
your own daughter's dream?

482
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,200
But this is the only way
I can get the evidence I need, Pu.

483
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,680
Sis…

484
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,320
Auntie!

485
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,200
I'm so happy to see you again!

486
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,280
Me too. But this round, we're competitors.

487
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,960
Only one can become the kitchen helper.

488
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,440
Don't you see me as a rival?

489
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,720
I'm here because I love cooking.

490
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm not here to compete against anyone.

491
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,760
Even if I don't pass today,

492
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,760
at least I'm doing what I love.

493
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,960
But cooking is tough and exhausting.

494
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,680
Why do you love it so much?

495
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,240
Because my idol is a chef.

496
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,800
And my uncle said
my mother was a chef too.

497
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,400
Namfah.

498
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,200
No matter what happens today,

499
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,640
don't give up.

500
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,800
Keep fighting.

501
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,480
I'll support you.

502
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,080
Yes! I'll do my best!

503
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,960
Good luck.

504
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,840
Being a kitchen helper requires precision

505
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,480
and attention to detail.

506
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,400
You must have
strong knowledge of ingredients,

507
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,280
handle them accurately

508
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,400
and quickly, and show real skill.

509
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,880
Your challenge is right in front of you.

510
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,360
All of you

511
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,280
will separate ten eggs
into yolks and whites,

512
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,200
slice onions exactly one millimeter thick,

513
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,400
up to one kilogram,

514
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,320
and shuck ten oysters,

515
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,560
ensuring the meat
remains perfectly intact.

516
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,000
You have 30 minutes.

517
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,800
Mistakes will result
in immediate elimination.

518
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,840
The fastest candidate
to finish with the highest quality,

519
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,960
only one person,

520
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,200
wins the position.

521
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,560
Cooking is both an art and a science.

522
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,440
Do your best. Is everyone ready?

523
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,640
Yes!

524
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,680
Begin!

525
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,320
You're eliminated.

526
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,320
Will she be okay?

527
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,160
Don't worry.
I saw the determination in her eyes.

528
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,120
It's just like yours.

529
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,120
Namfah dreamed
of being a chef since childhood.

530
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,520
I don't want her to be disappointed.

531
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,960
The harder something is to achieve,
the more valuable it becomes.

532
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,400
As long as your sister doesn't give up,

533
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,560
she'll succeed one day.

534
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,960
That's not always true.

535
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,560
Some people get everything handed
to them without lifting a finger,

536
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,160
just by taking what belongs to others.

537
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,120
Didn't expect you to care
about the kitchen, Kim.

538
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,840
Thought your only talent
was in the boardroom.

539
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,800
If it involves the hotel, I care.

540
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,920
Unlike some people
who jump into leadership

541
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,760
without a clue.

542
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,640
Don't forget.

543
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,840
I was running this place long before
you even graduated, Pathawee.

544
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,880
<i>Many people end up in tears</i>
<i>when chopping onions.</i>

545
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,400
<i>Here's a simple fix. Chewing gum</i>

546
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,840
<i>or sucking on candy while slicing</i>

547
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,680
<i>will help relieve</i>

548
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,960
<i>the irritation caused by onions.</i>

549
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,440
Exceeds one millimeter… You're eliminated.

550
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,800
You pass.

551
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,240
You pass.

552
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,240
Finished!

553
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,480
You pass.

554
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,760
Thank you.

555
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,000
Your sister really fights to the end.

556
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,000
She trained hard for this day.
She won't give up easily.

557
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,920
If your sister really wants to work here,
just tell me.

558
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,200
No need to waste time on this competition.

559
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,440
I want her to succeed
through her own abilities.

560
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,960
Even if she loses, she'll lose with pride,

561
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,120
not through connections or cheating.

562
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,560
Nubdao is right.

563
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,080
A true competitor fights with honor,

564
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,440
just like me and you.

565
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,720
You're not my competitor.

566
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,760
I don't even consider you a challenge.

567
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,600
I'd like to withdraw, Chef.

568
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,600
Does it hurt?

569
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,280
It's okay. You should keep going, Auntie.
Time's running out.

570
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,920
Let's patch you up first.

571
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,160
I'll do it.

572
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,040
- What happened?
- She got cut.

573
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,080
Is it deep?

574
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,920
Not deep. Just needs a dressing.

575
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,000
All right, if you're okay,

576
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,200
you can continue.

577
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,280
Okay.

578
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,840
Will she make it?

579
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,240
She will.

580
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,600
You have to believe in Namfah.

581
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,640
There's still time to change your mind.
I can help.

582
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,600
Thank you,

583
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,760
but no.

584
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,760
I believe that a person's worth
is determined by their work,

585
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,520
not by who they know.

586
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,640
Politics is everywhere, Nubdao.

587
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,120
You can't change that.

588
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,640
I might not change it,

589
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,720
but I can choose not to be part of it.

590
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,480
You have to be careful.

591
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,960
You can never really know
someone's true intentions these days.

592
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,320
FOR YOU, HOPE IT HELPS
KILL BILL

593
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,360
I don't care where they are.

594
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,080
Drag them to me. Understood?

595
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,480
Another one of your women?

596
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,360
No, sir. I'm just an employee.

597
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,360
Not yet.

598
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,120
But in the future, who knows?

599
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,160
<i>Nubdao.</i>

600
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,040
- She doesn't love you.
- Wee!

601
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,440
Wee!

602
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,320
