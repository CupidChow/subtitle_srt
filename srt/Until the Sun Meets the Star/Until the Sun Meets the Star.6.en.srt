00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>Your test results</i>
<i>will be emailed to you by midnight.</i>

2
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
Auntie, this is my sister, Nubdao.

3
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,400
Namfah…

4
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,680
Nubdao…

5
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,200
A new video just dropped from Eat with Me!

6
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,880
You follow that channel?

7
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm the ultimate fangirl!

8
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,400
The email is here!

9
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,360
HELPER CHEF RESULT
CONGRATULATIONS TO MS. NAMFAH

10
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,080
I know everyone's worried,

11
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,680
but what do you expect me to do?

12
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,640
Some internet troll
made up this entire story.

13
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,960
- You're really going to compete?
- I have to.

14
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,080
But Namfah really wants this job.

15
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,000
<i>If you enter, there's no way she'll win.</i>

16
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,800
<i>Are you going to crush</i>
<i>your daughter's dream?</i>

17
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,280
But this is the only way
I can get the evidence I need, Pu.

18
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
Let's patch you up first.

19
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,480
I'll do it.

20
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,000
There's still time to change your mind.
I can help.

21
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,560
I believe that a person's worth
is determined by their work,

22
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,920
not by who they know.

23
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,480
All ten pieces are intact.

24
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,480
None were torn by the shucker.

25
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,080
Have you done this before?

26
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,760
No.

27
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,680
For your first time,
this is really impressive.

28
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
You pass.

29
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,720
This is perfect.

30
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,120
Yes.

31
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,960
Nine pieces?

32
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,600
Why are there only nine?

33
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
I accidentally tore one.

34
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,840
In that case, we have our winner.

35
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,720
How was it, Namfah? Did you pass?

36
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,680
I did.

37
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
I made it, Nubdao.

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,280
I made it, Nubdao!

39
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
I made it!

40
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Good job! Congratulations!

41
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,080
Thank you for always helping me.

42
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,560
You did really well.

43
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,240
Auntie.

44
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Namfah.

45
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,280
I just wanted to thank you
for teaching me how to shuck oysters.

46
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wedge the shucker
into the side of the shell,

47
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,400
then run it along the edge to open it.

48
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
If the muscle's still attached,

49
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,520
use a small knife to cut it.

50
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,400
Oh, that? It's nothing.

51
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,200
I helped because
I saw how hard you were trying.

52
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,640
Even after getting hurt,

53
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,520
you kept going.

54
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,400
I really admire your determination.

55
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,120
That oyster…

56
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,520
Did you purposely tear it
to help me?

57
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,160
Not at all, dear.

58
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,480
It was my mistake.

59
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
I was in a hurry,
and my hands were shaking.

60
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,400
I see.

61
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,760
We've been talking all this time,
but I don't know your name.

62
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,120
What is it?

63
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
Ratree.

64
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,600
My name is Ratree.

65
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,560
Will I see you again, Aunt Ratree?

66
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm sure we will meet again.

67
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
All right.

68
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,520
Take good care of yourself, dear.

69
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,720
You and your sister only have each other.

70
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,040
You need to love each other.

71
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,520
Be careful.

72
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,920
You can never really know
someone's true intentions these days.

73
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't trust anyone too easily.

74
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,600
Thank you so much, Auntie.

75
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,640
All right.

76
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,280
Oh, I heard Pu was bragging about you

77
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,000
becoming a head chef soon. Is that true?

78
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,640
It's just a kitchen helper, Auntie.
Uncle Pu likes to talk big.

79
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,120
She still has a lot to learn about cooking

80
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
before she can become a chef.

81
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,280
Hurry up and get good at it,

82
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,480
so I can ask you for some recipes
for my own food stall.

83
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,240
If anything, I should
be learning from you, Aunt Phit.

84
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,280
We'll see. By the way, where's Pu?

85
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Probably at the gambling den again.

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,360
You're really lucky, Namfah,

87
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
to have landed a job.

88
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,000
- Thank you.
- Tonight,

89
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
I can sleep peacefully. Thank you.

90
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,920
- Thank you, Auntie.
- I'm going now.

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,720
- Alright.
- Okay.

92
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,440
I can sleep peacefully tonight.
What a nice day!

93
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,680
Let's go.

94
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,480
- Pu.
- Yeah?

95
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,520
I did the right thing, didn't I?

96
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,960
You did.
At least Namfah got her dream job.

97
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,200
But I still don't trust them,
especially Taychit.

98
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm afraid

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
they'll do to my daughter
what they did to me.

100
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,320
Sis, it's been ages.

101
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,720
You should move on.
He might have already changed.

102
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,720
No way.

103
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,600
People like him never change.

104
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,720
He's still the same. I know him.

105
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,840
But you're still sending
your daughters there?

106
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,360
As long as he doesn't know
they are my kids,

107
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,200
there should be nothing to worry about.

108
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
Lost in thought about me, Mr. Wee?

109
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,800
What? Who would think about you?

110
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,520
If not me, then who?

111
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,440
Or… maybe your secretary, Yada?

112
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,760
Stop guessing.
You won't die from not knowing.

113
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,040
I will! If I don't find out, it'll kill me

114
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,160
My curiosity is off the charts.

115
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,120
Who could it be, huh?
Who stole my friend’s heart?

116
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
Alright, alright.
I'll introduce you sometime.

117
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,200
But tonight, finish your work.
No slacking.

118
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,000
Got it, boss.

119
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
It's beautiful.

120
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,080
Yes.

121
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,760
Beautiful.

122
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,040
So beautiful.

123
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,960
The stars tonight
are more beautiful than ever.

124
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,560
You're quite romantic, aren't you?

125
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,840
Only to some people.

126
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,040
Someone important to me.

127
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,360
Do you say this to every woman?

128
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,320
You're the first.

129
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,000
It's late. I better head home.

130
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
Wait.

131
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,200
Nubdao.

132
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
Nubdao, wait.

133
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,120
Nubdao doesn't love you.

134
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,360
Wee!

135
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
Wee!

136
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,520
I was having such a good dream.

137
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,800
Crazy dream.

138
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
NUBDAO PRATEEPKAMOL

139
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,200
Ms. Jitree.

140
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,560
I made Masaman curry for you.
Please try some.

141
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,120
You think I'll go easy on you
just because of your Masaman curry?

142
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,200
I think it's time
we let go of past grudges.

143
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,640
Thank you.

144
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,920
You must have a green thumb.
Everything you plant flourishes.

145
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,680
What's this flower?

146
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,680
It smells nice, and the color is lovely.

147
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,800
Oleander.

148
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,920
I've only heard the name. Never knew
it looked like this. Is it hard to grow?

149
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,080
It's easy to plant,
and even harder to kill.

150
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,880
Most people only know it
as an ornamental plant,

151
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,840
unaware of how many lives it has claimed.

152
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,960
Oleander is poisonous?

153
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,680
I had no idea.

154
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,200
Of course.

155
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600
If its poison dissolves
in water and is ingested,

156
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,640
it causes nausea, vomiting, dizziness,

157
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,200
blurred vision, ringing ears,

158
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,120
and a slowed pulse.

159
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,120
In severe cases,
it can even stop the heart.

160
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,640
What's wrong?
Are you afraid I might poison you?

161
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
Wait…

162
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,120
What kind of tea did you give me?

163
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,440
So, you do fear for your life after all.

164
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,600
Relax.

165
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,000
It's not oleander tea.

166
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
You won't die from drinking it.

167
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,680
It's a holy day today.
I'm not in the mood for killing.

168
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,840
Now get lost.

169
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,880
That was so satisfying, Grandma!
That mistress must be shaken up.

170
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm playing a mind game with her.
Let's see how strong she really is.

171
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,480
But what if she tells Dad?

172
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,319
Oh, she wouldn't dare.

173
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,480
Sasi has always been a coward.

174
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,840
You're amazing.

175
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,720
Honestly, you should've just poisoned her
and gotten rid of her already.

176
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,360
If she died now, where's the fun in that?

177
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,200
I want her to suffer so much,
she'd beg to be in hell instead.

178
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,560
Oh wow, Grandma! You're incredible!

179
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,200
Good, isn't it?

180
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,680
- Does this taste good?
- Very good.

181
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,680
Good afternoon, ma'am.

182
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,120
I'm getting a hot stone massage today.
Oh, and use rosewood for the aroma.

183
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,040
And give me a body scrub too.

184
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,040
Someone's already booked those services.
Could you choose another package?

185
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,800
No way. I was here first,
so serve me first. Make it happen.

186
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm a special guest of Mr. Kimhan.

187
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,400
The guest who booked before you

188
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,880
is also a special guest of Mr. Kimhan.

189
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,120
And who on earth could possibly
be more special than me?

190
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
I asked you. Who is it?

191
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,440
That would be me.

192
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,440
I was expecting some VIP.

193
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,120
Turns out, it's just a washed-up actress

194
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
now resorting to OnlyFans.

195
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,480
Oh dear, have you even looked
in the mirror lately?

196
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,080
When was your last gig again?

197
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,320
When was that?

198
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
About five years ago?

199
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,600
Honestly, you'd be better off
parading as a car model at local fairs.

200
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,360
Are you that desperate for attention?
Running around picking fights like a dog?

201
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,560
Oh, but then again, people from low places

202
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,200
always look low,

203
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,840
no matter how hard they try.

204
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,000
And you? Where exactly did you come from?

205
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,560
Don't tell me you've forgotten your roots.

206
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,720
A hostess who clawed
her way into modeling?

207
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,680
Honestly, I should applaud
your determination.

208
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,720
That's not even enough.

209
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,920
You think you're the only one
who can throw hands?

210
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,320
Huh, Cindy?

211
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,520
Ma'am.

212
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,240
- Please, let's not resort to violence.
- Please, don't fight.

213
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,280
Why?

214
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,760
- You lowlife!
- Look who's talking, you trash!

215
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,480
You idiot!

216
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,920
Every time you two see each other,
there's always drama.

217
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,320
What should I do?

218
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
She started it.
I was just defending myself.

219
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,320
Wow, how shameless.
Your lies are next level.

220
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,240
Mr. Kimhan, you can ask the staff here

221
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,480
who started it first.

222
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,520
- You b--
- Enough.

223
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,720
Both of you.

224
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,680
You think I don't know exactly
what you're like?

225
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,960
Alright, I'll ask this one last time.

226
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Name your price.

227
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,520
- For what?
- A payout.

228
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,040
I'll pay you to get out of my life.

229
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,320
- Mr. Kimhan!
- Mr. Kimhan!

230
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,280
- No!
- No!

231
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
I don't want that.

232
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm your wife!
You can't just throw me away!

233
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm also your wife!
You can't just cast me aside!

234
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,320
Nubdao, come with me.

235
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,840
- Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim!
- Holding hands?

236
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,360
This is all your fault!

237
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,160
- You started it!
- No, it's your fault!

238
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,120
This isn't the time
for you to be in a good mood

239
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,720
Then, what mood should I be in?

240
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,880
You should at least feel bad.
Two women just fought because of you.

241
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
And?

242
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,560
And you're acting like nothing happened?

243
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I've warned those two countless times.
What else do you expect me to do?

244
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,800
Should I set up a boxing ring
and let them fight it out?

245
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,240
Whoever loses gets out of my life.
Would that settle things?

246
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,160
Anyone with you
is doomed to a lifetime in hell.

247
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Want to join me in hell?

248
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
What is it, Mr. Chairman?

249
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,760
You give me a headache every single day.

250
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,000
It's my business. Why does it bother you?

251
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
You don't even deserve
to share my last name.

252
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,280
A scandal like this in our hotel,
employees gossiping,

253
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,000
it's shameful. Do you understand?

254
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,400
It's been this way since your generation.
Still not used to it?

255
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
How dare you talk back to me,
you ungrateful brat?

256
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm just stating facts. Can't handle it?

257
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,040
Excuse me. I'll wait outside.

258
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,360
No.

259
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Stay here.

260
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,280
Might as well get to know my family.

261
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,000
Another one of your women?

262
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,880
No, sir. I'm just an employee.

263
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,880
Not yet.

264
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,720
But who knows about the future?

265
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,720
Kim, get your woman out of my office now.

266
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,360
Go!

267
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,800
Let's go.

268
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,640
What is it?

269
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,320
Sir, have you seen this?

270
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,440
THE DEAD ARE COMING BACK FOR REVENGE
KILL BILL

271
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,560
- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE
- THEN WHO KILLED HIM? TELL ME

272
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,000
I WON'T SAY A THING

273
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,480
IT'S NOT HARD TO GUESS

274
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,440
WHOEVER BENEFITS MUST'VE DONE THAT

275
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,480
IS IT T.M.?

276
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,240
WHO IS T.M.?

277
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,200
THE OWNER
OF "THE HEAVEN OF THE EAST" HOTEL.

278
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,920
REALLY? OMG!

279
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
Haven't you found them yet?

280
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,040
I've been keeping an eye on them, sir.

281
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,640
They're coming out now.

282
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,480
Bring that person to me.

283
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,160
I need to know what they have on Aran.

284
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,840
Got it, sir.

285
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,720
Hey, make way.

286
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,480
Are you sure it's her?

287
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,880
Yes, I followed her,

288
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,920
but she noticed and escaped.

289
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,440
But I went back
and checked the security footage.

290
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,720
It's definitely Mirantee.

291
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,600
I've never even seen her face,

292
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,840
and now she's messing with my life.

293
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,600
When did she get out of prison?

294
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,200
A few days ago.

295
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,640
She was a model prisoner
and got an early release.

296
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,640
She's just a scapegoat.

297
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,000
Does she really think she can hurt me?

298
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,200
It sounds like Mr. Kimhan
doesn't get along with the chairman.

299
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,600
I doubt it. They're father and son.
They won't stay angry forever.

300
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,280
Nubdao.

301
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,480
Have you heard
the rumors about the chairman?

302
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,720
What rumors?

303
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,640
Well…

304
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
They say…

305
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,600
he shot his friend,
the hotel's co-founder.

306
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,800
What are you talking about, Namfah?

307
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
If someone overhears us,
we'll be in trouble.

308
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,920
It's too late. It's already trending.

309
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,920
Someone's probably spreading fake news
just to damage his reputation

310
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,880
What are you talking about?

311
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Well…

312
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,240
We were just discussing

313
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,400
my first day at work, Mr. Pathawee.

314
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,040
What's with you?
You're talking way too formally.

315
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,840
Well…

316
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,920
Well…

317
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,440
you're my boss now.

318
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,400
I can't exactly speak casually.

319
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,760
Just talk like you always do.
Forget the titles. I'm not used to it.

320
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,640
That's a relief.

321
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,880
Acting formal feels unnatural to me too.

322
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,080
Mr. Wee, you can relax as well.

323
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,520
Just talk to me like before. Don't think
of me as your subordinate. I don't mind.

324
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,040
Just see me as your colleague, okay?

325
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,760
Namfah, that's too much.

326
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,920
Namfah is right.

327
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,720
I'd rather
we see each other as colleagues.

328
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,240
It'll help us get along better.

329
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,960
Mr. Maiaek is in a meeting with the chefs.
I'll go get him.

330
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,960
Wait.

331
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,480
Yes?

332
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,440
I'm not here for Maiaek.

333
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,280
I wanted to celebrate
your success, Namfah.

334
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,240
It's just a kitchen helper job.
It doesn't need a big celebration.

335
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,960
Every role here is equally important.

336
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,240
I want you to feel part of our family.

337
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,760
If it's to celebrate Namfah,
why did he invite me?

338
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,720
Look at all this food.
I can't possibly eat it all alone.

339
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,080
Glad you're here. You can help us.

340
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,040
Nubdao loves fish.

341
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,520
Mr. Wee, can you pass her some?

342
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,560
The fish cheek is the best part.

343
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,160
Try it.

344
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,960
But it's Namfah's celebration.

345
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,920
She should get the best piece.

346
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,400
Take it. I'll have the tail.

347
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,480
Then I'll go ahead and eat it.

348
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,560
Go ahead.

349
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,160
This is delicious, Nubdao.

350
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,880
Way better than the fish at home.

351
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,840
Oh, can I try the omelet?

352
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,480
Sure.

353
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,000
Nubdao, here.

354
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,160
If you like it,
we can come here more often.

355
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,680
That would be too much trouble.

356
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,040
Then invite Mr. Wee over
to our house sometime.

357
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,440
I'll cook for everyone.

358
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,120
That's a great idea.

359
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,600
I'd love to taste your cooking.

360
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,480
Yes, Mr. Kimhan?

361
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,199
Come see me, right now.

362
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,800
- But--
- No buts.

363
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,199
I know you're still at the hotel.
You've got five minutes.

364
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,440
Something wrong?

365
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,880
Mr. Kimhan wants to see me urgently.

366
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,040
It's after hours.

367
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,760
You can say no to Kim sometimes.

368
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
You don't have to jump whenever he calls.

369
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,360
Front office handles urgent issues.

370
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,280
Maybe something happened. Excuse me.

371
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,040
Please look after Namfah, Mr. Pathawee.

372
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,480
Nubdao…

373
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,440
What do you think is the most important
trait in the service industry?

374
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,720
A service mindset.

375
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,720
You must genuinely care
about your work and customers.

376
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,040
For me, loyalty matters most.

377
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,920
Without trust, customers won't return.

378
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,640
What exactly are you trying to say?

379
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,000
Just be direct.
No need to beat around the bush.

380
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,680
Alright, fine.

381
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,840
You know I don't get along with Pathawee.
Don't spend time with him. Clear enough?

382
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,760
It is.

383
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,080
But not reasonable.

384
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,120
Just because you have issues with him
doesn't mean I do.

385
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,120
We can work together even if we disagree.

386
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,840
I don't want you
wasting your time on others.

387
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,520
Right now, I only have you, Nubdao.

388
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,160
I think you're stressed from work today.
I'll leave you alone.

389
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,640
Nubdao, where are you going?
Listen to me first. Nubdao!

390
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Where are you going?
At least hear me out, Nubdao!

391
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,360
It hurts.

392
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,600
Thank you.

393
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm sorry…

394
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,600
for losing my temper earlier.

395
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,440
It's fine. Just don't do it again.

396
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,440
I've applied a cold compress
to ease the pain.

397
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,040
Make sure your ankle doesn't come
into contact with heat for 48 hours.

398
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,440
If the blood vessels expand,

399
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,160
it'll hurt more and take longer to heal.

400
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,800
If we didn't already know each other,
I'd think you were a doctor.

401
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,920
I used to be a reckless kid,

402
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,000
so I've picked up some experience.

403
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,840
No wonder girls won't let you go easily,

404
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,280
with how well you take care of them.

405
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,560
You're throwing shade at me again,
aren't you?

406
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,760
I'm not. I'm just making
an observation based on what I see.

407
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,160
Maybe I was a flirt before,
but I've stopped.

408
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Now I'm just a tame little cat.

409
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,400
Quitting being a flirt is that easy?

410
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,200
Maybe I've found a goal in life.

411
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,120
As long as your goal doesn't hurt anyone,

412
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,600
I'll be cheering you on to reach it.

413
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,320
MR. ARAN

414
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,240
Do you think this will work?

415
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,000
Who would know the story better
than Mr. Aran himself?

416
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,320
Nonsense.

417
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,720
If you don't believe it,
don't disrespect it.

418
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,200
If you really want to know,

419
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,120
you have to do what I say.

420
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
I'm going

421
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,160
to light the incense
and summon Mr. Aran's spirit

422
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,680
into this glass,
then you can ask him directly.

423
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Are you sure about this?

424
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
You'll find out soon enough.

425
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,280
I'm okay.

426
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,960
I humbly summon the soul of Mr. Aran

427
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,680
to reside in this glass. Let it be so!

428
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,920
Touch it.

429
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,680
Come on. Touch it.

430
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,360
Hurry up!

431
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,880
Place it on the glass, not on my finger!

432
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,920
You too!

433
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,840
Alright.

434
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,000
Now,

435
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,280
focus your minds and chant after me.

436
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,960
Ma-ma-ma-ma…

437
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,240
Ma-ma-ma-ma…

438
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,000
Spirit of Mr. Aran…

439
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,200
- Spirit of Mr. Aran…
- Come forth!

440
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,600
Come forth!

441
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,400
- Louder!
- Louder!

442
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
- Louder!
- Louder!

443
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,720
Ugh, I meant speak louder,

444
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,960
so the spirit can hear!

445
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,760
Let's try again.

446
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,720
Ma-ma-ma-ma…

447
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,920
Ma-ma-ma-ma…

448
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,600
Spirit of Mr. Aran…

449
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,720
Spirit of Mr. Aran…

450
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,240
- Come forth!
- Come forth!

451
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,600
What are you all doing?

452
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,600
Ghost!

453
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm scared!

454
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,840
I'm scared! I'm sorry!

455
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,040
I'm scared!

456
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,360
Don't kill me!

457
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,760
There's no ghost here. It's just me.

458
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,120
Mr. Pathawee! Good evening, sir.

459
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,920
It's late. Why aren't you all home yet?
What are you up to?

460
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,120
Are you playing Ouija?

461
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,560
We're not playing.

462
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,160
So, you actually believe those rumors?

463
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,000
Half-believe, half-doubt, sir.

464
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,800
Even if Mr. Aran was murdered,
I don't believe

465
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,680
the chairman was behind it.

466
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,600
I'm sorry. What are you saying?

467
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't believe it.
Who could kill their best friend?

468
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,440
Best friends turn against each other
for money and power all the time.

469
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,080
It's all over the news.

470
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,840
But I'm sure it wasn't my father.

471
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,360
He may seem strict,

472
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,160
but he loves his people, looks after
employees, and gives people chances.

473
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,960
Seems like you take after
your father exactly, Mr. Pathawee.

474
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,280
That's why you keep looking after
and taking care of my sister.

475
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,440
I know you have a thing for Nubdao.

476
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,160
So… would you help me?

477
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,800
Help you with my sister?

478
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,920
Easy peasy.

479
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,600
But I have one condition.

480
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,080
You have to help me with something.

481
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,760
Okay. If you help me,
I'll help you with anything.

482
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,960
Now, what do you need my help with?

483
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,840
Mr. Kim is so cold-hearted.

484
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,240
Your foot is swollen,
and he still lets you go home alone.

485
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,280
Couldn't he at least drive you back?
So heartless.

486
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,280
Don't blame him.

487
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,280
He and I are in different positions.

488
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,000
Besides, I don't like troubling people
unless it's necessary.

489
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,160
Unlike Mr. Wee. After we finished eating,

490
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,280
he drove me home.

491
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,960
What kind of man is this? Perfect,
handsome, and such a gentleman.

492
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,400
So cool.

493
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,760
Nubdao, what do you think of Mr. Wee?

494
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,240
He's nice.

495
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,560
He seems calm,

496
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,280
smart, distant, and cool.

497
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Why do you ask?

498
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,600
I think he likes you.

499
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,840
And you? Do you have any interest in him?

500
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,240
A perfect guy like him has options.
He wouldn't be interested in me.

501
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,920
- But--
- And don't try

502
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,080
to play matchmaker.

503
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,400
It won't work.
Let him find someone who truly suits him.

504
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,320
Come on, Nubdao. That's so cold.

505
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,920
Or…

506
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,920
Do you already have
someone you like? Spill it!

507
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,160
Hey! Well?

508
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,440
Who texted you?

509
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,680
Go to bed.

510
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
Who texted you?

511
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,120
It's bedtime.

512
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,840
Suspicious.

513
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,320
HOW'S YOUR FOOT?

514
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,880
BETTER NOW

515
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,120
I'M SORRY

516
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,120
YOU'VE SAID SORRY A HUNDRED TIMES NOW

517
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,760
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE MAD

518
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,920
I'M NOT MAD. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT

519
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,280
I'LL ALLOW YOU TO TAKE A DAY OFF TOMORROW

520
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:09,440
LET'S SEE HOW I FEEL FIRST
I DON'T WANT TO MISS WORK

521
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,360
Please stop here.

522
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,600
Why?

523
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,120
I'll walk from here.

524
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,280
I'll take you home.

525
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,800
That way, I can help you.

526
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,760
I don't want people around here
to see us in a bad light.

527
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,000
Are you afraid they'll assume

528
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,880
something about us?

529
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,200
Yes.

530
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,680
You can call me old-fashioned,
outdated, or whatever,

531
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,560
but I care about these things.

532
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,600
Just the fact that you brought me home
is more than enough.

533
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,520
When will you start talking to me
like a normal person?

534
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,960
Don't normal people talk to you like this?

535
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,080
No.

536
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,480
Other people don't talk to me
like a robot or some AI like you do.

537
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,600
You're my boss.

538
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,360
If I don't talk like this,
how else should I speak?

539
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,800
Just think of me as a friend.

540
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,400
Talk casually.
No need for all the formalities,

541
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,600
like "sir" or something like that.
Can you do that?

542
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,400
This is an order.

543
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,200
I'll try, sir.

544
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,120
Nubdao…

545
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,240
Take this!

546
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,280
It's been a week.

547
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,920
Are you paying or not?

548
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,640
I don't have any money. Even if
you kill me, I still won't have any.

549
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,320
If you don't pay, I'll cut off one finger
for every thousand you owe.

550
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,480
No! Don't cut my fingers!

551
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,560
Please, I'm begging you!

552
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,120
Even if you cut off all 20 fingers,

553
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,760
he still won't have the money to pay you.

554
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,320
- Sis.
- This isn't your business.

555
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
- Stay out of it.
- How much does he owe you?

556
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,480
- Seven thousand.
- Seven thousand my ass! I owe you 5,000.

557
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,040
That 5,000 is the principal.
The other 2,000 is interest.

558
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,880
Damn it.

559
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,560
I'll give you 10,000.

560
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,080
Leave him alone.

561
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,280
See that?

562
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,480
My sis is amazing.
You better not mess with me again.

563
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,800
I'll give you 20,000.

564
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,520
If he steps into a gambling den again,

565
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,040
beat the hell out of him for me.

566
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,040
Got it, sis.

567
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,680
Sis!

568
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
Why did you do that to me?

569
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,000
That's what I should ask you.

570
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,040
Since when did Mr. Pathawee
and Namfah start getting cozy?

571
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,520
And why are you so nosy about them?

572
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,640
Well, I just wanna know.

573
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,520
I saw them together last night.
Seems like favoritism to me.

574
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,320
I don't think so.

575
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,880
Namfah got in through her own skills.

576
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,120
When you first started working here,
you weren't even as good as she is.

577
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,720
Yeah, I agree.

578
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,400
- Exactly.
- She's even smarter than you.

579
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,320
Me?

580
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,880
- What did I do?
- You're just dumb.

581
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,360
Correct.

582
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,520
Did you realize it now?

583
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,240
There.

584
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,840
Don't be dramatic.

585
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,600
Thanks, sis.

586
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,240
If you hadn't helped me,
I'd be missing a few fingers.

587
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,840
I wasn't planning on helping you for free.

588
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,080
Are you making me work
as a kitchen helper?

589
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,280
No way, it's too hot in there.

590
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,840
Did I ever say
I was going back to being a chef?

591
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,120
Then, what do you want me to do?

592
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,360
No one's here?

593
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,800
Dear gods, please help me.

594
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,280
Alright, let's do this.

595
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,640
Alright.

596
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,440
Let's go.

597
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,400
Let's do this.

598
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,480
Who are you here to see?

599
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,280
Ms. Wadee…

600
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,000
It's been a while.
What are you sending me now?

601
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,840
TO MR. TAYCHIT
FROM WADEE KANCHANASILP

602
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,400
FOR YOU, HOPE IT WILL BE USEFUL
KILL BILL

603
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,040
I don't care where they are.

604
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,000
You have to drag them here.

605
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,760
Got it?

606
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,880
Then go!

607
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,240
The rumors about our hotel
are clearly affecting our booking rates.

608
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,240
The best way to respond to fake news

609
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,680
is to ignore it.
Let it die down on its own.

610
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,960
If we can't provide an answer,
people have every right to be suspicious.

611
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,720
So, you think my father did it, too?

612
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,400
I wouldn't dare judge
based on rumors alone.

613
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,640
That wouldn't be fair.

614
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,040
Then don't judge me as a womanizer either.

615
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,600
That one's not just a rumor.
I saw it with my own eyes.

616
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,800
What you saw may not be what it seems.

617
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,440
Just like my father.

618
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,200
He may seem hot-tempered, but I believe
he wouldn't do something like that.

619
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,960
The only way
to restore the hotel's reputation

620
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,880
is to uncover the truth,
so guests can regain their trust.

621
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,480
Fine. Let's do that.

622
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,600
If you really want to find the truth
about this case, I'll take you somewhere.

623
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,280
What is it?

624
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,360
It's not good news.
It's about Mr. Pathawee.

625
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,400
Spit it out.

626
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,720
Well, I have something to show you.

627
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,320
- <i>Quit it.</i>
- I can't.

628
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,240
You have to!

629
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,600
If you don't stop,

630
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,960
I'll send you overseas.

631
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,480
You wanted evidence, right?

632
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,280
This is the hotel's archive room.

633
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,360
You might find something here.

634
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,000
The man standing next to him
should be Mr. Aran.

635
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,520
But who's the woman beside him?

636
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,520
Who the hell is he?

637
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,640
Who is he?

638
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,680
Pu.

639
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,800
I need you to do something for me.

640
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,440
What now, sis?

641
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,720
