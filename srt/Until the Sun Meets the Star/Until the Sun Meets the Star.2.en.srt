1
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,200
Miss Nubdao Prateepkamol,

2
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
25 years old.

3
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
Are you actually
interviewing me for this job?

4
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,800
That's exactly what I'm doing.

5
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
Uncle Pu!

6
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
Give the money back!

7
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm going!

8
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
- Uncle Pu!
- I'll be back!

9
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,480
You thief of an uncle!
Stealing even your own niece's money!

10
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,920
Ever since this woman entered our house…

11
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
And who do you think killed Mother?

12
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,520
It was you.

13
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,720
Tomorrow, Mr. Kimhan,

14
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,240
vice president of Oriental Paradise,

15
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,440
will personally assess you.

16
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,200
You really are interesting,

17
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,600
Nubdao.

18
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
I wanted to discuss business with you.

19
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,160
I barely have enough for transportation.
Find another way.

20
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Fine.

21
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm going now.

22
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,760
Do you want to eat with us?

23
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,120
No, thanks.

24
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,080
I wouldn't want to ruin
Mrs. Sasi's appetite.

25
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,640
I asked you nicely.

26
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,160
I did too. Just say what you want to say.

27
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,320
Don't beat around the bush.
It's a waste of time.

28
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm expanding
Oriental Paradise's business empire.

29
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,279
Who's managing it?
Your mistress or her son.

30
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,160
I haven't decided yet,
but it won't be you.

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
Do whatever you want.
Why are you telling me?

32
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,600
I just want you to know

33
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,760
that I'm transferring
half of my hotel shares

34
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
to Pathawee.

35
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,200
<i>You're old, yet still lust-driven.</i>
<i>Blinded by your mistress.</i>

36
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,480
<i>I just want you to know</i>

37
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,400
<i>that I'm transferring</i>
<i>half of my hotel shares</i>

38
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,400
to Pathawee.

39
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,960
Isn't that a bit much?

40
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,960
Giving the mistress's son
more shares than the legitimate son?

41
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,680
Because I trust Pathawee more than you.

42
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,960
This hotel was Mom's too.

43
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,600
She worked her way up with you,

44
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
and now you're giving it to your mistress
and her son?

45
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Where's your loyalty to Mom?

46
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,080
Where is your mother now? She's gone.

47
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,320
Everything belongs to me.

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,400
Mr. Techit,

49
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,400
maybe now isn't the best time
to talk about this.

50
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
I've made my decision.

51
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
Whether you like it or not,
that's not my problem.

52
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I just wanted you to know.

53
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
Keep this necklace safe, my son.

54
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,840
It's the sun.

55
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,720
I named you Kimhan

56
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
because it means "summer".

57
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,000
I wanted you to have
a bright and warm life,

58
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,920
like the morning sun in midsummer.

59
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,200
I didn't want your life to be as dark

60
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
and bleak

61
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,600
as mine.

62
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,280
Mom, don't cry.

63
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,480
This necklace

64
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
will be a part of me.

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,880
No matter where you go,

66
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,640
I'll always be with you.

67
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,040
I'll keep this necklace safe.

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,080
No one will ever love me
like you did, Mom.

69
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,640
Gina…

70
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,760
Are you free tonight?

71
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,920
Please don't go.

72
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,120
- Let me go!
- Please.

73
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,080
You won't even agree to a divorce!

74
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,840
What about our children?

75
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,320
Kimhan and Promtawan
will be left without a father.

76
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,559
If he wants to leave, then let him.

77
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,080
When a man loses himself in lust,
no one can stop him.

78
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,600
Get up, Jitsuda!

79
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,200
If you won't keep your dignity,

80
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,160
at least think about your children.

81
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,920
They're seeing how promiscuous
their father is right now.

82
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,080
You have no right to talk to me like that!

83
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,640
- Why not?
- This is between me and Jitsuda.

84
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,800
You know exactly what you've done.

85
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,560
You got my daughter pregnant,
and you won't take responsibility?

86
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I don't even know if he's really my son.

87
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
What the hell are you saying?
If he's not your son, then whose is he?

88
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,200
Or do you want a DNA test?

89
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,040
Maybe we should make it public
and let everyone hear about your filth?

90
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,160
Hey.

91
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,400
Tell your mother that I'm not stupid.

92
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,640
I know exactly what's going on. Let me go!

93
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,400
No…

94
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,440
Let go! I said let go!

95
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
- Let him go!
- Let go!

96
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,040
Damn it! Let go!

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Jitsuda!

98
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,320
<i>I don't even know if he's really my son.</i>

99
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,760
Are you stressed?

100
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll give you a massage.

101
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,160
No need.

102
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,320
Go get dressed.

103
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,240
What are you looking for, Nubdao?

104
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,400
My wallet. I can't find it anywhere.

105
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
It must've been Uncle Pu.

106
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,360
I don't have money for the bus.
How will I get to my interview?

107
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,960
Take mine first.

108
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,800
But…

109
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
What about you?

110
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,880
I'll borrow from a friend at university.

111
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Just go, or you'll be late.

112
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,120
I'll pay you back soon.

113
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,520
I have to go.

114
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,680
Uncle Pu!

115
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,200
Mr. Kimhan is waiting for you inside.

116
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

117
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm ready for my final test.

118
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,680
What's the rush?
Sit down and talk first. Please.

119
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,120
This is the Grand Royal Suite,

120
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,280
the finest and most expensive room
we offer.

121
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,160
How well do you know it?

122
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,160
The Grand Royal Suite

123
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,280
has hosted world leaders

124
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,400
and VIPs.

125
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,880
It spans 300 square meters,

126
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
with rates starting at 250,000 baht,

127
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
reaching up to 400,000 to 500,000
during peak season.

128
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,840
Not bad. You've done your homework.

129
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,720
But I won't be testing you on the basics.

130
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Then, what is it you want to test me on?

131
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,800
A front office position requires
dealing with all kinds of guests.

132
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,600
One of the key skills is negotiation.

133
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,720
Your final test is simple.

134
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,360
Do whatever you want

135
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,520
and make me walk out of this room

136
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,960
without making me feel like
you're forcing me.

137
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,360
I'm not in a rush.

138
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,360
I have all day and night for you.

139
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,920
Or do you want to stay the night
with me here? That's alright too.

140
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,800
I can't exactly ask an executive like you

141
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,240
to leave this room.

142
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
That would be rude.

143
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,440
But if you want me

144
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,640
to get you into this room,

145
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,080
that's easy.

146
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,360
Alright. If that's what you want,

147
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,200
I won't argue.

148
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,040
What now?
How are you going to get me back in?

149
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,320
That's up to you.

150
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,600
Because I've already passed the test.

151
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,800
What do you mean?

152
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,600
You asked me to make you walk out

153
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,400
without feeling forced.

154
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,520
And look, you walked out on your own.

155
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,040
Whether you walk back in or not,

156
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,440
that's your choice, not mine.

157
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm hiring you as a front office trainee.

158
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,840
You can start tomorrow.

159
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,600
Am I really getting this job?

160
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,240
You're not mishearing things,
and you're not dreaming.

161
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,760
Just don't make me and Mr. Kimhan
regret this decision.

162
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I will do my absolute best
in every task I'm given.

163
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,760
Thank you.

164
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
Wait.

165
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,000
Your shoes.
When are you planning to replace them?

166
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,480
Huh?

167
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh my! What is this?

168
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,200
I really hate

169
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,760
people who dress so sloppily
and disrespect the place.

170
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm sorry.

171
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,160
I'll buy new shoes as soon as possible.

172
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,560
Ms. Sanguansri.

173
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,480
Yes?

174
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,640
Arrange for her uniform expenses.

175
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,480
I don't want our hotel's reputation
to be affected.

176
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,640
Oh, of course.

177
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,240
Mr. Kimhan signed a paycheck
in advance for you,

178
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,760
so you won't struggle too much.

179
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,240
I'll deduct it

180
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
from your salary every month

181
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,160
until it's fully repaid.

182
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,599
Thank you so much.

183
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,359
Hold on.

184
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,040
Your ID card.

185
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,920
What are you looking for, Nubdao?

186
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,760
My wallet. I can't find it anywhere.

187
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,200
It must've been Uncle Pu.

188
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Fine.

189
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,840
I lost my ID card.

190
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,280
What?! You lost your ID card?

191
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,840
What are you going to do with your life?

192
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm really sorry.
I'll be more careful from now on.

193
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,040
Listen here.
I can't stand careless people

194
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,840
who don't even take care
of their important belongings.

195
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,440
How am I supposed to trust you with work?

196
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,320
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity to work here.

197
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,240
Hello, kitty.

198
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,560
Come eat.

199
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,720
Eat now.

200
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,880
Why doesn't he play with me, Mom?

201
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,600
He's scared. You need to tame him first.

202
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,000
If he's tamed, he'll play with me, right?

203
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,960
Yes.

204
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,280
Then, how do I tame him, Mom?

205
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,360
Cats are like any other living beings.

206
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,360
You need to love them first.
Then they'll love you.

207
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,280
And if they love you,

208
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,920
they're tamed and won't leave you again.

209
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,120
Hello, kitty.

210
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,160
So, you're a cat person too?

211
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,840
I just think it's cute.

212
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
You're quite something.

213
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,840
It's only been a short while,
and this little thing already trusts you.

214
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,880
Cats are just like
any other living beings.

215
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,520
If we love them, they'll love us back.

216
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,920
My mother used to say the same thing.

217
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,520
But look at this.

218
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,040
He doesn't love me.

219
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,400
That's because
you don't truly love it yet.

220
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,920
No matter how good you are,

221
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,080
you'll never be able to read my mind,

222
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,640
whether I love something or not.

223
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,000
That's not hard to see at all.

224
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,360
Even the cat knows
that you're only pretending to love him.

225
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,640
Why on earth
did you invite me out for a meal

226
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,160
instead of one of your girls?

227
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,560
We haven't had dinner together
in a long time.

228
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,160
I just wanted to see you. I miss you.

229
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,960
Miss me?

230
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,680
Or are you just worried
I'll start messing up my life?

231
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,680
I really do miss you.

232
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,560
I miss you and worry about you too.
You know that, right?

233
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,320
If only Dad were more like you.

234
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,080
Even your birthday

235
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,440
and my birthday,

236
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
he forgets them all.

237
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,400
Even a cake

238
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,720
or a simple card

239
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,640
we've been waiting for every year,

240
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,120
we've never had it.

241
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
I miss Mom.

242
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,680
Why?

243
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,560
Why can't our family be like others, Kim?

244
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,880
Even though Mom's gone,

245
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,520
you still have me.

246
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,560
It's her fault.

247
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,320
Sasi and her son ruined our family.

248
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,120
He's abroad now.

249
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,600
What if he comes back?

250
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,240
How much longer
do we have to put up with this?

251
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,320
Forever?

252
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,720
Mr. Wee!

253
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
I missed you so much.

254
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I would've sent a driver to the airport.

255
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,080
It's fine, Dad. It's not a big deal.

256
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,760
Are you tired?

257
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,400
Was school tough?

258
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,560
Not at all, Mom.

259
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,400
Now that you've graduated,

260
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,520
I plan to have you
take over Oriental Paradise after me.

261
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Leeches sure have it easy.

262
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,440
They don't have to do a thing all day,
just suck others dry.

263
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,360
Who are you calling a leech?

264
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,320
Anyone who gets so desperate over
taking things that don't belong to them.

265
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,600
Even another woman's husband.

266
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,720
Enough of this. This is too much.

267
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,080
Too much?

268
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,280
I'd say it's not nearly enough.

269
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,680
People like them

270
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,200
don't feel shame no matter what we say.

271
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,760
Right, Mrs. Sasi?

272
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Go now.

273
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,160
Get some rest.

274
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,120
Get some rest.

275
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,760
Welcome home.

276
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,040
I hope you enjoy your happiness
built on our suffering,

277
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,560
just like you and your mother did to us.

278
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,720
Can I not get involved

279
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,000
in the hotel business?

280
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,320
Come on. Kimhan and Tawan

281
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,400
are just messing with you.
Just ignore them.

282
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,400
But I care about
how Kimhan and Tawan feel.

283
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,160
The more you push this,

284
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,040
the deeper the rift
in our family will grow.

285
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
I agree with our son.

286
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,200
He shouldn't get involved in this.

287
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,960
If our son doesn't do it, then who will?

288
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,360
I don't want to see the business
I built with my own hands

289
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,240
collapse right before my eyes

290
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,320
because that bastard Kimhan
takes the executive seat after me.

291
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
But Kim graduated with a master's
in hospitality management from Glion

292
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,960
in Switzerland.

293
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
Wouldn't he be better suited
to run the business than me?

294
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,920
I don't trust him.

295
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,360
All he ever does
is waste his days away with women.

296
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,480
And Tawan? She's no better.

297
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,120
The only one
who can take over after me is you.

298
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,840
Let him decide for himself.

299
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,160
Maybe there's something
he wants to do more than this.

300
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,400
I always choose what's best for you.

301
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,400
Don't disappoint me.

302
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,080
I knew this would happen.

303
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
There's no way I'm letting this slide.
It's Mom's hotel.

304
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,880
How can Dad give more shares
to Pathawee than Kim and me?

305
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
What is he thinking?

306
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,680
It has to be that mistress of his,

307
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,520
whispering nonsense into his ear.

308
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Do you think your father
would even be where he is today

309
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,520
if it weren't for your mother?

310
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,640
She stood by him

311
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,680
when his business collapsed,
when he lost everything.

312
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,240
I wish I could kick those two
out of this house.

313
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,640
So, what about you, Kimhan?

314
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,680
Things have come this far.
What are you going to do about it?

315
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Watch yourself.

316
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,720
That hotel your mother built

317
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,440
will end up in their hands
if you're not careful.

318
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,840
Stop, Namfah!

319
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,960
It hurts!

320
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,680
Good. So you'll learn your lesson!

321
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,800
Are you my niece or my mother?

322
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,840
If you were my kid, I would've stuffed
ashes into your mouth ages ago.

323
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,280
How could you steal Nabdao's wallet?

324
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,720
What's wrong with you?

325
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,000
I just wanna shake some sense into you!

326
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
Hey, stop!

327
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,160
I ended up like this because I raised you.

328
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,200
Otherwise, I'd have a PhD by now
and be living the high life.

329
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,920
You know, whenever I try to get a girl,
they all turn me down.

330
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,240
You know why?

331
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,200
Because they all think
I already have two kids.

332
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Hand over the wallet.

333
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
Fine, take it.

334
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,320
Where's the money?

335
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,160
I borrowed it. But I'll pay it back.

336
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,120
Just give me some time.

337
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,360
I've had enough of you!

338
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,000
You deserve a beating!

339
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,840
Hey! Stop.

340
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,960
- Stop.
- Take it, take it!

341
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,960
Go on, and don't you ever come back!

342
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,680
<i>When will I ever get to be happy</i>
<i>like everyone else?</i>

343
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,440
Happiness or suffering, it all depends
on the heart. We can choose for ourselves.

344
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,880
So, what will you choose, my girls?

345
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,720
Of course, I'll choose happiness.

346
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,200
And what about you, Nabdao?

347
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Can you really choose something like that?

348
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,680
If I could choose,
I'd want to choose happiness.

349
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,000
The more suffering you endure,
the closer you get to happiness.

350
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,160
When you grow up, you'll understand.

351
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,040
The more suffering you endure,

352
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,600
the closer you get to happiness.

353
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,040
You didn't lie to me, did you, Dad?

354
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,800
Why aren't you sleeping yet, Nubdao?

355
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,560
Isn't it your first day of work tomorrow?

356
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,480
I was thinking about Dad.

357
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,920
I miss him too.

358
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
And I miss Mom.

359
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,800
That's why I don't want
to be angry at Uncle Pu,

360
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,240
no matter how many mistakes he makes.

361
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,120
Why not?

362
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,280
Because to me,

363
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,320
he's the only thing left
that reminds me of Mom.

364
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,320
As long as he's here,

365
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,240
I feel like Mom isn't too far away.

366
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,200
Like she's still watching over us

367
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,640
from one of the stars up there.

368
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,400
You have a meeting with your father
at the hotel tomorrow morning.

369
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,159
Don't forget.

370
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
Do I really have to go?

371
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,280
No one can refuse your father.

372
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,080
Do what you can, alright?

373
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,480
I wonder when Kim and Tawan
will finally make peace with us.

374
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,000
It's been years already.

375
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,280
Some wounds

376
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,600
can feel like a nightmare
that lasts a lifetime.

377
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,560
I understand how they feel.

378
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,960
But when will they understand us?

379
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,320
These things take time.

380
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,120
You need patience

381
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,040
and forgiveness.

382
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,200
I'll try.

383
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,400
As of this moment,

384
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,280
you are officially a front office trainee

385
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,840
at Oriental Paradise.

386
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,880
Thank you very much.

387
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,200
They're here! They're here!

388
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,960
- Who?
- Sir!

389
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,600
Sir who?

390
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,040
Mr. Kimhan and Mr. Pathawee.

391
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,120
Go tell everyone to get ready.

392
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,800
- Go now.
- Yes, ma'am.

393
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,320
You too, Nubdao.

394
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,960
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,840
Welcome to Oriental Paradise,

396
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,280
Mr. Pathawee.

397
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,040
It's my first day on the job.

398
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,640
I look forward to working with everyone.

399
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,480
Well, it might be your first
and your last day too.

400
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,840
Mr. Kim, such a joker.

401
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,320
Oh.

402
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,560
I meant this might be the last time
we have such a welcoming ceremony.

403
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,880
It's a waste of working hours.

404
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,640
Oh.

405
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,840
Make yourself at home.

406
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,880
Just think of yourself as a guest here.

407
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,160
And as the host, I welcome you,

408
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,000
our future executive, with all my heart.

409
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,840
I hope to learn a lot from you.

410
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,600
Oh, I wouldn't dare try to teach you.

411
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,360
It'd be like teaching a crocodile to swim.

412
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,160
And I'm sure your mother, Mrs. Sasi,

413
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,960
has already taught you well.

414
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,400
Excuse me,

415
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,520
but the board meeting is about to start.

416
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,520
Perhaps we should all
head upstairs and prepare?

417
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,520
I hereby appoint Pathawee,

418
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,240
my other son,

419
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,240
as the vice president

420
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,080
of Oriental Paradise Group.

421
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Well? Don't just sit there. Clap.

422
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,400
Does this mean

423
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,480
our hotel will now
have two vice presidents?

424
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,760
Absolutely.

425
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,800
The real question is,
who will prove to be the better one?

426
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,080
Business is all about competition.

427
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,000
Only the strongest survive.

428
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,760
And the weak, they get eliminated.
Right, Mr. President?

429
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,240
That's right. I plan to expand

430
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,000
our hotel chain,

431
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,480
and I want Pathawee to oversee it.

432
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,640
He will have full executive power,
equal to mine.

433
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Interesting.

434
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,840
There's a lot of potential
for expansion and investment.

435
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,440
I'm really looking forward
to hearing your vision, Mr. Pathawee.

436
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,520
I will attract tourists

437
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,480
to our hotel through food.

438
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,280
Tourists choose hotels

439
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,800
based on comfort, cleanliness,

440
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,520
and safety.

441
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,600
Our biggest selling point is our location,
right by the beach,

442
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,800
with a private beach
and luxurious five-star accommodations

443
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,520
that offer a breathtaking
360-degree ocean view,

444
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,560
unmatched by any other in the area.

445
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,920
But based on what I'm hearing,

446
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,920
your vision sounds more suitable

447
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,880
for opening a restaurant
than managing a luxury hotel.

448
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,800
But we need to create
a unique experience for our guests.

449
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,360
Beyond location

450
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,880
and service,

451
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,400
food can be

452
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,840
one of our major attractions.

453
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,200
Many high-end hotels

454
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,240
have gained global recognition through
their fine dining and buffet experiences.

455
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,680
That's interesting. A hotel that sells
both accommodations and food.

456
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,480
Anyway,

457
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,080
do we already have a Michelin-starred chef
who can attract such high-end customers,

458
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,760
Mr. Pathawee?

459
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,440
No?

460
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,400
Then, perhaps you should start

461
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,720
by finding a good cook for our guests.

462
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,600
Damn it! Everything's ruined.

463
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,720
Kimhan wanted to humiliate us.

464
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,760
It's my fault I wasn't fully prepared.

465
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,760
If we don't have a chef,
we hire one. Simple!

466
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,520
But a skilled chef we can trust
isn't easy to find, Dad.

467
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,640
Forget the expansion for now.

468
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,320
Most of the board
already doubts your leadership.

469
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,000
For now, you'll stay here
and help me manage the hotel.

470
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Yes, Dad.

471
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,520
- Sanguansri.
- Yes, sir?

472
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Take Wee on a tour.
Show him what he needs to know.

473
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,880
Right away, sir.

474
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,360
This is our banquet hall.

475
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,880
We have two large ballrooms here.

476
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,560
Mr. Pathawee, is there any department
you're interested in?

477
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,040
Boiling, stir-frying, curry, deep-frying,
all delicious in an instant.

478
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,600
We have a hot kitchen here

479
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,600
that can cater to guests 24 hours a day.

480
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,200
There, there. Such a good kitty.

481
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,040
Mr. Pathawee.

482
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,000
Take your time.
I just stepped out for some fresh air.

483
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,360
You just started working today too, right?

484
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,680
Miss Nubdao.

485
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,680
Yes, it's my first day.

486
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,640
How did you know?

487
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,240
This morning, I noticed you bowed
a bit later than the other employees.

488
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,960
I'm just a trainee.

489
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,120
If I did anything to displease you,
I sincerely apologize.

490
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,160
You don't need to apologize.
You didn't do anything wrong.

491
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,680
I felt just as lost on my first day.

492
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,400
Hopefully, I'll adjust soon.

493
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,240
You could consult Mr. Kimhan.

494
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,440
I'm not very close with him.

495
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,600
Talking to him just leads to a fight.

496
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,200
What's it like working with him?

497
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,240
Don't be afraid. Just say it.
I'd really like to know.

498
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,880
- Mr. Kimhan is--
- I'm what?

499
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,280
Are you pretending,
or do you really not know?

500
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,320
This hotel has a strict rule against
gossiping about guests behind their backs,

501
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,120
including your superiors.

502
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,640
- I know.
- You do?

503
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,160
Then, why did you do it?

504
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,240
Because I wasn't speaking ill of you.

505
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,040
It's still against the rules.

506
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,240
I understand. It won't happen again.

507
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,880
And how can I be sure of that?

508
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,960
How do I know you won't talk
behind my back again?

509
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,400
I said I wouldn't,

510
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,160
and I mean it.

511
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,360
And how much do you expect me
to trust just your words, Miss Nubdao?

512
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,160
I've given my word.

513
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,560
Whether you trust me or not,

514
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,760
that's up to you.

515
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,360
From now on, you're not allowed
to be alone with him again.

516
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,360
Why can't I talk to Mr. Pathawee?

517
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,320
Because it's an order.
No discussions, nothing.

518
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,880
Good timing, Ms. Sanguansri.

519
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,440
Keep a closer eye on your staff.
Don't let her cross the line.

520
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,040
Yes, Mr. Kim.

521
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,240
I hate gossipers.

522
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,840
People who talk behind their boss's back.

523
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,320
I sincerely apologize.

524
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,200
I didn't mean to cause trouble for you.

525
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,600
At least you realize it.

526
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,520
First day on the job
and already causing problems.

527
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,680
Don't forget
you're still in your training period.

528
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
I can fire you whenever I want.

529
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,200
I understand.

530
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,840
This time, I'll put you on probation.

531
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,640
But if you mess up again,

532
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,520
don't call me heartless.

533
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,160
As for work,
you'll get the hang of it over time.

534
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,280
I don't think anything

535
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,280
will be too much of a headache,
except for dealing with people.

536
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,760
Dad, I have a request.

537
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,200
Go ahead. What is it?

538
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,080
I'd like to request

539
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,720
a personal secretary.

540
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,320
That's all?

541
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,120
Sure.

542
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,560
I'll have Sanguansri find someone
competent and efficient for you.

543
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,760
I already have someone in mind.

544
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,480
Nubdao! Nubdao! Nubdao!

545
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,200
Hurry! Come see your sister!

546
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,920
Namfah!

547
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,680
Namfah!

548
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,520
Namfah.

549
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,600
Namfah, can you hear me?

550
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,400
Nubdao?

551
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,000
Namfah, can you hear me? Namfah.

552
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,440
Nubdao.

553
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,680
Mr. Pathawee, please help!

554
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,960
Come on. Let me help.

555
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
Please wait a moment.

556
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,920
Hold her.

557
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,080
She's with the doctor now.
She will be okay.

558
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,120
Seventeen years ago,

559
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,320
Namfah and I were in a terrible accident.

560
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,160
We almost didn't make it.

561
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,760
Luckily,

562
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,040
a boy saved us.

563
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,600
Help me.

564
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,840
Help me.

565
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,920
Help me.

566
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,920
Please help my sister.

567
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,160
I'm here to help. Hang on.

568
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,800
I never forgot him.

569
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,600
I still hope

570
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,760
that one day, I'll see him again.

571
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,000
And if you do,

572
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,640
will you recognize him?

573
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,800
I'm not sure,

574
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,400
but I hope I'll remember.

575
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,440
And I hope
I'll get the chance to thank him.

576
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,360
You were really lucky
to have met him that day.

577
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,640
If it had been me,

578
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,080
you and your sister
might not have made it.

579
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,520
What do you mean?

580
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,960
<i>As a kid, I was a coward.</i>

581
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,320
<i>I saw a car accident,</i>
<i>but I didn't have the courage to step in.</i>

582
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,880
Even now, I still feel guilty about it.

583
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,360
But today, you saved Namfah.

584
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,640
If you hadn't come by,

585
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,000
I don't know
what would've happened to her.

586
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,400
Thank you, Mr. Pathawee.

587
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,320
Instead of me making you feel better,

588
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,040
it seems like
you're the one comforting me.

589
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,920
I still owe you a favor.

590
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,360
One more of this.

591
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,680
I knew I'd find you here.

592
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,800
What do you want?

593
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,560
Tonight,

594
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,840
I'm coming home with you.

595
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,640
I'm busy.

596
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,240
Busy? What do you mean?

597
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,440
Busy means busy.

598
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,000
Don't you understand Thai?

599
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,480
Who's she, Kim?

600
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,840
Should I introduce myself
as your girlfriend,

601
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,960
lover, or wife?

602
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,240
A wife?

603
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,560
More like a rented wife.

604
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,720
Temporary or overnight?

605
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,680
This must be what they mean

606
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,480
by "manners reveal your upbringing".

607
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,160
Makes me wonder how you were raised.

608
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,200
Did your parents even have time
to teach you anything?

609
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,640
Because the way you talk
says a lot about your background.

610
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,720
Cindy!

611
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,920
To deal with low-class trash

612
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,680
is to treat them like it.

613
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,360
Mr. Kim, I can't accept this!

614
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,280
A woman like you is just a jellyfish.

615
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,760
Soft, innocent-looking, but full of venom.

616
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,560
Let's go, Kim. I'm sleepy now.

617
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,480
Suit yourself.

618
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,360
Who did you just call a jellyfish?

619
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,480
You plastic-faced bitch.

620
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,800
You're fake from head to toe!

621
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,440
Says the brainless idiot!

622
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,560
Your dad never hugged you enough?

623
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,120
Is that why you're so desperate
for another girl's man?

624
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,040
It's a competition.

625
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,720
If you can't keep him, that's on you.

626
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,200
There's nothing to eat?

627
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,120
- Right there.
- Where?

628
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,600
The air is your food. Eat up.

629
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,920
Namfah, you little devil!

630
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,520
I heard this statue

631
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,840
is seriously haunted.

632
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,840
- Who let this thing in here?
- I ordered them to bring it in.

633
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,440
Get rid of it. Now.

634
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,160
Between young Mr. Aran and me now,
who's more handsome?

635
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,440
Tell him that you're mine.

636
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,640
Let's not argue over this.

637
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,600
Let Nubdao decide
who she wants to work for.

638
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,120
Tell me…

639
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,360
Am I still your first love?

640
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,280
