1
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,954
UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,301
Hello.

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,761
I am Hong Jang-mi.

4
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,683
HONG JANG-MI

5
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,231
Take a seat, President Shin.

6
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,067
You too.

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,651
Sit.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,496
You belong to
the Risk Management Division.

9
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,623
What were you doing

10
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,792
in the Trading Division
on the day of the incident?

11
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,920
I was assisting
with the lunch deliveries in Trading.

12
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,631
It's difficult for traders
to leave their desks

13
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,007
before the market closes.

14
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,677
Yet there was only one female employee
in charge of delivering all their lunches.

15
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,387
Do you admit your wrongdoing?

16
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,140
No.

17
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,184
Did you intentionally cause

18
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,478
the order error incident?

19
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,563
Me?

20
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,483
Did your careless behavior trigger

21
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,485
a domino-like chain of disruption?

22
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,320
- Dominos?
- Ms. Hong! You--

23
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,446
Just a moment.

24
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,117
Mr. So.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,912
What happened to the investors who bought
Hanye Electronics stock at that time?

26
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,456
The Korea Exchange mediated,

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,585
and we amicably recovered the funds
from the other investment firms.

28
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,671
However, Onemillion Investments,

29
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,133
a Texas-based US firm,
still remains unreachable.

30
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,342
What's the amount?

31
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,845
At the market price that day,

32
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,223
it came to about three billion won.

33
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,729
TO THE WORLD! TO THE FUTURE!
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

34
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,361
Beyond the Han River, to the World!
To the Future! Hanmin!

35
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,740
That three billion was entrusted to us
by our investors.

36
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,451
We must recover the funds first.

37
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,662
I believe those funds

38
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,998
must be retrieved, no matter what.

39
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,709
Ms. Hong,

40
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,962
are you expressing an intent
to resolve this matter by any means?

41
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,590
Who, me?

42
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,009
Mr. So, what do you say?

43
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,263
Both Hanmin and the Korea Exchange
fell short of delivering on this.

44
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,766
I'm not sure how Ms. Hong
will be able to accomplish such a feat.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,894
She's clearly determined.

46
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,438
Secure a signed agreement
for order cancellation

47
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,939
from Onemillion.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,109
You want me to do that?

49
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,659
Hey, can you hear anything?

50
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,496
Good morning.

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,998
Hello, sir.

52
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,167
Good morning.

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,251
Hello, sir.

54
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,377
Hello.

55
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,839
Ms. Hong, how'd it go?

56
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,133
We heard Big Al's father shout earlier.

57
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,927
Let's talk back at the office. Let's go.

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,013
Don't tell me you were out here
waiting for me this whole time.

59
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:43,932
We weren't.

60
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,610
They just kept trying to make it seem like
the order error was solely on me.

61
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,528
That's messed up.

62
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,030
How wronged you must feel.

63
00:03:59,113 --> 00:03:59,989
Totally.

64
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,784
I suggested they should be focused
on retrieving the lost money first.

65
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,826
- Money?
- What money?

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,245
The three billion that got away?

67
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,665
Ms. Hong.

68
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,334
You made quite an impressive
empty promise back there.

69
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,628
You're hilarious.

70
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,712
"Hilarious"?

71
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,173
The responsible party flees,

72
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,051
and I'm about to be fired
for cleaning up their mess.

73
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:20,969
Is that hilarious?

74
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,099
Look at you talking back
with all that attitude.

75
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,142
Is that how you were raised?

76
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,020
Yes. My mom and dad taught me that.

77
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,898
You're the dad of two daughters,
aren't you?

78
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,943
Do they know that you torment
someone else's daughter at work?

79
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,237
Hey, family's off limits!

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,571
- So petty!
- Come on now!

81
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,865
Mr. Cha, that's enough.

82
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,908
Mind your manners.

83
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,326
- But she--
- Manners!

84
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,786
Manners.

85
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,709
Thank you for calling.
You've reached Risk Management.

86
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,419
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,838
Just a moment.

88
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,381
It's the president.

89
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,925
He's probably calling
about your termination.

90
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,554
I'm only being this polite
because I still work here.

91
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,972
Stop fighting.

92
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,268
Put him on speakerphone.

93
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,898
Hello, sir.

94
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,942
Has Ms. Hong updated you?

95
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,277
On what exactly?

96
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,905
I'm to find Onemillion Investments

97
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,949
and secure
the order cancellation agreement.

98
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,534
Why?

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,994
Why would she?

100
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,204
Ms. Hong volunteered.

101
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,041
She must be insane.

102
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,376
And what if

103
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,920
she fails to secure it?

104
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,048
Then she will be terminated.

105
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,553
No, you see, what happened was…

106
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,471
- Forget it.
- Please.

107
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,516
- I hope you do.
- Just forget it.

108
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,445
And this is the last time
you answer my call on speaker.

109
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,033
Did you call for me, sir?

110
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,410
You must know Ms. Hong. You live together.

111
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,456
"Seoul City Dormitory
for Single Female Workers, Room 301."

112
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,624
She's your roommate.

113
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,626
Yes, that's right.

114
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,921
It's not just the two of us.
There are four of us living together.

115
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,255
I wouldn't say we're friends.

116
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,508
We're not close at all.

117
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,551
I've been informed

118
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,304
that she scored the highest
on the written recruitment exam.

119
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,891
I heard top-performing students
are normally hired early

120
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,309
in commercial high schools.

121
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,062
Yes, that is normally the case.

122
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,482
However, it appears
that Ms. Hong took a gap period

123
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,192
after graduation.

124
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,865
I'm not sure
if I should be telling you this…

125
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,243
Please speak candidly.

126
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,620
If I were to share a few observations…

127
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,249
She's a long way
from being mild-mannered, compliant,

128
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,709
or respectful to her seniors.

129
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,503
She steers clear of such qualities.

130
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,589
She probably failed every other interview.

131
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,466
Also, she lacks interpersonal skills.

132
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,051
She's quite stubborn,

133
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,762
and her fingers are
a tad bit on the sticky side.

134
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,390
I see.

135
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:16,978
You may leave.

136
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,646
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,333
Why do things keep blowing up?

138
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,419
Why? I need to find Yehppee!

139
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,970
<i>Trying to fire a minion for damage control</i>
<i>only makes them more suspicious.</i>

140
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,513
<i>The order-entry error?</i>

141
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,307
<i>It has to be connected to the slush fund.</i>

142
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,017
<i>I'll expose the truth.</i>

143
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,768
I refuse to leave until I do.

144
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,853
I refuse!

145
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,821
EPISODE 4: SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY

146
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,252
Was it really that difficult

147
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,631
to quietly set aside just three billion

148
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:31,135
while the prosecution
and the FSS had their guard down?

149
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,012
Did I ask too much of you?

150
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,266
What a ruckus you've caused.

151
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,478
I'm sorry, sir.

152
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,146
I met with the CEO of Onemillion.

153
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,442
We agreed to delay cashing out
until things quiet down.

154
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,904
Since I started this,

155
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,531
I will see it through.

156
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,792
HANYE ELECTRONICS 11:27

157
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,835
It's a simple order.

158
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,006
You'll be compensated handsomely
for your services.

159
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,397
I'm sure Myeong-hwi's passing
was just as upsetting for you

160
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,733
as it was for me.

161
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,362
But still, it's better
to honor him with success,

162
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,532
not regret.

163
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,871
Do you plan on disappointing me?

164
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,875
No, sir. Please give me another chance.

165
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,632
That's enough.

166
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,473
Are you drinking booze?

167
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,476
Have some class.
Show some dignity as the future chairman.

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,561
Watch how I drink it.

169
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,771
President Shin is so annoying.

170
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,940
He'll fire away if we can't catch
the CEO of Onemillion.

171
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,610
What? Fire you?

172
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,737
Dad, have some class.

173
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,364
Not me.

174
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,574
Ms. Hong.

175
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,911
Hey, you make sure
you stay out of this one.

176
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,998
Did you hear about the rumors too?

177
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,333
There are rumors?

178
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,335
There's a rumor going around

179
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,338
about how there was
another suspicious transaction in Trading

180
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,422
about a year ago as well.

181
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,261
Keep this to yourself.

182
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,474
The chairman ordered Mr. So
to manipulate the market…

183
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,060
to gather funds

184
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,146
to fill that slush fund reservoir
slowly but surely.

185
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,357
So that no one can see
what lies beneath the surface.

186
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,233
What about you?

187
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
- Have you seen it?
- What?

188
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,071
That slush fund reservoir.

189
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,823
I never got a chance to.

190
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,661
The chairman is the only one
who knows where it is.

191
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,788
I feel like Ms. Song might know.

192
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,041
I'm still about to lose
one of my employees!

193
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,627
That's how you respond
after I painstakingly explain everything?

194
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,796
You just have to fire one employee

195
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,423
for you to gain
all of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

196
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,904
PERSONAL DETAILS

197
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,950
Looking into Assistant Manager Jung
led to General Manager So.

198
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,702
That's the CEO of Onemillion next to them.

199
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,579
Just look at them.

200
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,833
You can clearly tell
it's not their first meeting. Right?

201
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,418
I thought he was Yehppee,

202
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,420
but he was just a dog.

203
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,132
Also, the CEO of Onemillion
is a total weasel.

204
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,926
There were so many chances to lock him up.

205
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,719
I'd managed to land several jabs

206
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,222
but never the knockout punch,
so he still walks free.

207
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,225
But do you think
he'll just sign that agreement

208
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,060
even if you find him?

209
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,687
I'll make him.

210
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,148
Wait, he was granted parole
due to diabetes?

211
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,566
Yeah.

212
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,526
I noticed he was
quite a picky eater that day.

213
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,571
He even has alarms set up
for his medication.

214
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,574
I should really quit carbs and sweets too.

215
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,618
But I can't, thanks to a certain someone.

216
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,536
A certain someone?

217
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,122
Thanks to a certain someone,
I'm wearing this uniform.

218
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,915
I even had to cut my hair.

219
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,918
Thanks to a certain someone,
I'm having a pastry and milk for lunch.

220
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,213
Thanks to a certain someone,
I'm stuck in this damn duck boat!

221
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,756
I'm almost 60, for goodness' sake.

222
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
I never rode one even when I was dating.

223
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,885
I can take this, right?

224
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,262
What do you think?

225
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,597
Showing them that
will only raise suspicions.

226
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,018
You have to prove it using methods
that would only be accessible

227
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,436
to the 20-year-old Hong Jang-mi.

228
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,980
You just have to make a lot of sense.

229
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,901
So Gyeong-dong is out.
He's no longer a Yehppee candidate.

230
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,821
I can't get fired, so I'll focus on
finding the CEO of Onemillion.

231
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,574
Find me something I can use as leverage
after I catch that weasel.

232
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,658
Hold on. Let me write that down.

233
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,537
Lunch is over in ten minutes.

234
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,997
Turn the boat around. Hurry.

235
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,332
- Ten minutes?
- We need to move it.

236
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,042
Damn it.

237
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,085
We've come too far from the shore.

238
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,671
We're going backwards! Turn around! Go!

239
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,759
We're too far from shore!

240
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,887
It's not an investment firm?

241
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,430
You're a supermarket?

242
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,434
After me, he even went and got
General Affairs to sign off on it

243
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,936
to call overseas.

244
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,480
Is this not Onemillion Investments?

245
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,106
But he just keeps speaking in Korean.

246
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,775
Are you sure?

247
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,692
Thank you.

248
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,118
The listed address is in Texas,

249
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,038
but the number belongs to Vicky Groceries,
a Korean supermarket in LA.

250
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,833
It seems Onemillion Investments
is a shell company.

251
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,295
A fake address and a fake phone number,

252
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,048
and a Korea-born US citizen
sitting in the fake CEO's seat.

253
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,717
It's likely that a Seoul-based
market rigging pro is behind this.

254
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,970
- We need to find them--
- And then what?

255
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,682
If you scored three billion for nothing,

256
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,059
would you admit to it
and just return it back to the sender?

257
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,228
That's why we must help.

258
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,897
Helping her won't change a thing.

259
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,484
I'm speaking from
years of experience here.

260
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,112
This is a pro's work we're looking at.

261
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,449
Ms. Hong, don't waste your time on this.
Just go and beg for your forgiveness.

262
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,576
But I did nothing wrong.

263
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,286
Sometimes you just have to suck it up!

264
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,704
I have no reason to beg.

265
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,872
That's enough.

266
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,960
Let's resume tomorrow.

267
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,255
It's six o'clock. Let's go home.

268
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,298
All right.

269
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,009
Nothing beats a drink for a headache.

270
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,678
- Let's go.
- No thanks.

271
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,346
Whatever.

272
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,181
I'll call you when we find a place.

273
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,112
Damn it.

274
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,665
Excuse me.

275
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,167
Excuse me.

276
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,087
I would prefer to stay out of it,

277
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:23,923
but you must know

278
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,759
the writing is on the wall with this one.

279
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,387
You need to just let it go
without making a fuss.

280
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,768
Must you insist on keeping Hong Jang-mi?

281
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,233
Man, that's sweet.

282
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,110
Mr. Bang.

283
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,236
Yes?

284
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,781
You know I'm a regular
at the video store across the street.

285
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,032
Right.

286
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,450
Lately,

287
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,621
finishing films has become impossible,
and the late-fee calls keep coming.

288
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,122
I see.

289
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,416
Ever since Ms. Hong was hired,

290
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,294
we've been working our butts off.

291
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,463
- Everyone keeps asking for me.
- Right.

292
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,548
But you know what?

293
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,555
I don't hate it.

294
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,307
Right.

295
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,812
Although…

296
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,399
I'm still just a spectator
outside of the ring.

297
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,665
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

298
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>I heard Hong Keum-bo's parents</i>
<i>are still running that pub in Incheon.</i>

299
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,455
You can't throw up here.

300
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,873
Let's go.

301
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,083
SEOKGWAN INN

302
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,713
This is it.

303
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,217
Have you seen this man before?

304
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,511
This is the address
on his resident registration record.

305
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,267
No, I've never seen him before.

306
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,145
Only the occasional day laborers
stay here for the month.

307
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,731
Why would a well-dressed man like him
stay at an inn long-term?

308
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,996
Hey, Mom.

309
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,373
<i>You're not skipping meals, right?</i>

310
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,542
You didn't even come home for Chuseok.

311
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,794
Should I go to you?

312
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,297
No, don't come. I'll go to you.

313
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,632
Wait…

314
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,760
Damn brat.

315
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,441
SEOUN UNIVERSITY

316
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,652
So? What did Keum-bo say?

317
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,237
Is she free tomorrow?

318
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,294
They're on the house.

319
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,338
These chicken legs are?

320
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,507
Mister, are you married?

321
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,967
Not yet.

322
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,386
Oh, I see.

323
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,637
What about a girlfriend?

324
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,142
No, I have no girlfriend.

325
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,687
Got it.

326
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,900
Thank you.

327
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,116
Hello there.

328
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,743
This is also on the house.

329
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,495
It's just a bit of
complimentary white kimchi.

330
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,874
That looks like a lot.

331
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,418
They say a son-in-law
is like an honored guest in the family.

332
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,004
You already feel like family to me.

333
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,133
Look at those muscular thighs.

334
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,148
Take care.

335
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,827
He's so handsome.

336
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,121
- I mean, I was…
- Mom! Dad!

337
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,415
What are you doing here this late?

338
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,586
- I'm here for a business trip.
- Goodness me.

339
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,339
You're way too old for crop tees.

340
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,090
A woman should keep her belly warm.

341
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,426
Pull up your pants. No, lower your shirt.

342
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,471
The man who just left with the bundle.
What was he doing here?

343
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,389
Did you see him? He's so handsome, right?

344
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,600
He's not married and has no girlfriend.

345
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,562
To start, his physique, frame,
and face all passed my test.

346
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,980
Why would you grade him?

347
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,565
We must think about the offspring.

348
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,691
Honey,

349
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,527
next time, we should ask him for his date
and time of birth so we can check

350
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,196
- their astrological compatibility.
- Right.

351
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,322
Mom.

352
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,617
Help us help you. We're so damn tired
of making that white kimchi.

353
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,701
Hello again.

354
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,414
I forgot my cellphone.

355
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,862
- What…
- Hold on.

356
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,906
- What was that?
- I don't know.

357
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,491
- What just happened?
- How would I know?

358
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,452
Wait.

359
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,205
Hold on. Stop.

360
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,043
Just a second.

361
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,719
What brings you all the way
to a pub in an alleyway

362
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,928
of Jemulpo Market in Incheon?

363
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,433
Don't tell me you're here to see me.

364
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,101
Is this a background check?

365
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,352
Am I under surveillance?

366
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,604
I'm not here for you, Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

367
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,982
I'm here for Hong Keum-bo.

368
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,110
You're here for my sister?

369
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,486
No, you.

370
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,323
On the street in Yeouido the other night,

371
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,158
at the disciplinary hearing
a few days ago,

372
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,452
and just now at your parents' restaurant.

373
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,704
I saw Hong Keum-bo every time.

374
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,250
Of course, you did.

375
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,710
We're sisters, after all.

376
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,593
I still see her now.

377
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,022
That's why you were dumped.

378
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,316
What?

379
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,942
You were dumped by my sister.

380
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,363
That's not something
you should talk about so lightly.

381
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,823
As if.

382
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,450
She told me all about her boy…

383
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,828
I mean, she told me all about
her relationship with you, President Shin.

384
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,206
Jeez, you have some gall coming here.

385
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,749
You know Keum-bo has a temper.

386
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,878
If I were her,
you would've already been torn to shreds.

387
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,881
Your remains would be buried
in that sandbox already.

388
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,382
What did you say?

389
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,843
You saw Hong Keum-bo in me? Unbelievable.

390
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,428
Your eyes must be getting old.

391
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,930
Wear some glasses, will you?

392
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,432
What about the sandglass?

393
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,434
Explain the sandglass
on your desk at the office.

394
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,562
Oh, that?

395
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,940
I saved that from my sister's garbage.

396
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,858
She threw it out?

397
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,193
Yes.

398
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,237
This too. And this.

399
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,448
They're all hand-me-downs from my sister.

400
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,408
All this over nothing.

401
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,245
Leave.

402
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,705
Good night.

403
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,551
What the hell?

404
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,888
No, I'm sure of it.

405
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,056
I know what I saw.

406
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,308
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

407
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,519
I saw Keum-bo

408
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,564
<i>take out this hairpin for some reason.</i>

409
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,942
<i>I couldn't tell if she was</i>
<i>doing it for her sake or his,</i>

410
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,945
<i>but she fixed her hair</i>
<i>and appearance swiftly.</i>

411
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,449
<i>Then, the two of them got really close.</i>

412
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,411
<i>They kept getting close,</i>
<i>then pulling away.</i>

413
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,289
<i>They carried on what seemed like</i>
<i>a sweet conversation.</i>

414
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,499
Did you hear what they were saying?

415
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,752
Damn. No, I couldn't hear anything.

416
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,381
Jeez. What do you have ears for?

417
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,175
Your ears and nose have
different holes for a reason.

418
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,010
No, that's not it.

419
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:30,927
You see…

420
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,267
You're back alone?

421
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,311
These are some side dishes for you.

422
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,772
What was that about
with the handsome mister earlier?

423
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,067
Mom, you want to marry me off, right?

424
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,486
Then just quietly wait and see.

425
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,406
Even if that man comes back here,
don't say a thing.

426
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,490
Zip it up.

427
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,825
- Zip.
- Zip.

428
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,458
- Thanks for the food.
- Sure.

429
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,584
Get home safely.

430
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,669
Lower that shirt.

431
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,588
And take a cab home!

432
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,303
Shin Jung-woo hasn't changed one bit.
He still has to see it to believe it.

433
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,014
But he hasn't figured it out yet.

434
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,600
That's why he's trying to
make me take the fall.

435
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,769
Or am I wrong? Maybe it's the opposite?

436
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,031
SEOUL CITY DORMITORY

437
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,451
Over here. Nora.

438
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,093
Why have you been ignoring my calls?

439
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,552
Here.

440
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,431
Handmade chocolate from the bakery
in Valis Hotel, your favorite.

441
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,599
You've missed them, haven't you?

442
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,401
I've been busy. What are you doing here?

443
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,612
It's been forever since
all three members of our family

444
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,031
have been together in Seoul like this.

445
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,118
We should go to your dad's this weekend
for some family time.

446
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,161
You just want me there

447
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,706
because you're worried
he won't open the door if you go alone.

448
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,708
Listen, the blood ties
between a child and a parent

449
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,668
don't just disappear because of a divorce.

450
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,752
"Blood types"?

451
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,131
Not blood types!
It's not exactly about blood…

452
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,384
Anyway, that's a thing.

453
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,928
Kang Nora.

454
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:37,887
Listen to me.

455
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,766
You're Kang Pil-beom's only daughter.

456
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,477
If anyone gives you hell at work,

457
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,104
write all their names down
in your notebook.

458
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,273
When you become chairwoman,
we'll send them packing.

459
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,692
You want me in that seat?

460
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,320
Then who else would I want?

461
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,365
I can do anything for you, Nora.

462
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,120
Really? You can do <i>anything</i>?

463
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,705
Yeah.

464
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,541
Do it.

465
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,876
You told me before

466
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,627
to stay by the cleverest one at work.

467
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,671
But that clever Hong Jang-mi

468
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,051
is about to get fired
after helping me deliver lunches.

469
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,220
I need her.

470
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,431
Hong Jang-mi?

471
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,099
Okay.

472
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,226
Believe in me.

Jang-mi, come and join us.

481
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,510
Let's watch a movie.

482
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,220
No thanks.

483
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,930
It's a romantic comedy.

484
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,474
I despise romance.

485
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,947
A post on Yeouido Pirates
claims you were fired.

486
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,156
Is it true?

487
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,617
Not yet.

488
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,077
I went through hell for this job.

489
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,496
I refuse to leave empty-handed.

490
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,624
So delicious. I refuse to let you leave.

491
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,792
By the way,

492
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,045
I did read a strange comment earlier.

THE HIDDEN TRUTH ABOUT
THE FEMALE HANMIN EMPLOYEE

494
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,512
That one right there.

"Hong Jang-mi was in on it."

496
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,685
"She just had the audacity to stab
the great Hanmin in the back afterward."

497
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,145
Me?

498
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,315
<i>Hong Jang-mi was in on it.</i>

499
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,401
<i>She just had the audacity</i>
<i>to stab the great Hanmin…</i>

500
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,612
<i>How could she be in on it?</i>
<i>She's just a matronly entry-level minion.</i>

501
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,115
<i>They just used her</i>
<i>because she's a high school grad,</i>

502
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,324
<i>a disposable staff.</i>

503
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,784
They're deliberately spreading lies.

504
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,206
Anyone who makes a living
in the stock market is on Yeouido Pirates.

505
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,917
As soon as Hong Jang-mi is fired,

506
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,878
the lies become truths.

507
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,671
Damn it.

508
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,427
What if we turn the lies into truths?

509
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,680
Like "Seodongyo,"
where gossip turned into reality?

510
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,474
"Seodongyo"?

511
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,897

Hey, don't you know who I am?

Unbelievable. Who's that kid?

00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,859
It'll be difficult for someone of her rank
to track down the CEO in hiding.

537
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,695
She'll soon wear herself out
and leave on her own.

538
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,739
Jeez.

539
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,741
More importantly,

540
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,618
there are rumors
that an insider was involved

541
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,370
in the Hanye Electronics incident.

542
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,164
What did you say?

543
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,591
- What's wrong with you all?
- Ma'am, you can't…

544
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,760
- Just tell him I'm here.
- He's in a meeting right now.

545
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,011
- Unbelievable.
- Ma'am…

546
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,220
Chairman.

547
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,597
What are you doing here?

548
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,059
Can I not visit my kid's office?

549
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,728
Just barging in whenever you feel like it…

550
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,314
I've never seen you before.
Who might you be?

551
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm Shin Jung-woo.

552
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,195
He's the newly appointed president.

553
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,238
I see.

554
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,659
Don't you know me?

555
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:35,995
My apologies.

556
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,707
I guess you only studied in school.

557
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,794
How should I introduce myself?

558
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,255
Are you married?

559
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,174
Not yet.

560
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,384
You've never been? I have.

561
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:50,927
I haven't.

562
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,391
Gosh, it's like he came
straight to work after graduating.

563
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,643
He's just like Myeong-hwi.
They're two peas in a pod.

564
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,647
You know the late President Kang?

565
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,899
I used to be his stepmom.

566
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,793
See you next time.

567
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,795
Take care, ma'am.

568
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,802
There are a lot of eyes on you.

569
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,763
What do you want me to do about it?

570
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,975
You think they wouldn't notice me
if I kept my mouth shut and behaved?

571
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,270
I get attention wherever I go,
and I've decided it's my destiny.

572
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,938
You'll never know how that feels.

573
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,190
Are you here for a reason?

574
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,819
My reason will always be Nora.

575
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,988
She has a friend named Hong Jang-mi.

576
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,240
Make sure she never gets fired.
That's what I came for.

577
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,997
In your dreams.

578
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,960
So Kang Nora has a friend now?

579
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,629
Hong Jang-mi?

580
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,927
YEOUIDO PIRATES
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

581
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,483
I hear Ms. Kang
and Hong Jang-mi are friends?

582
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,319
They joined in the same intake
and are roommates, so Nora…

583
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,989
I mean, I believe Ms. Kang
considers her a close friend.

584
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,869
Hong Jang-mi is a typical Gen X.

585
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,622
She's an immature, fearless 20-year-old.

586
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,248
That does describe

587
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,959
Ms. Kang's mental age.

588
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,964
She grew up lonely, so she's quite naive.

589
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,675
She trusts people too easily.

590
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,514
You should stay close to her

591
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,682
and keep a closer eye on her.

592
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,936
Yes, ma'am. I will do my utmost best.

593
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,526
Is this Yeouido Pirates post true?

594
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,945
Did you find the CEO of Onemillion?

595
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,572
No, I'm just leading everybody on.

596
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,076
In order to flush him out of hiding
and into the open,

597
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,286
we need to put strain
on his relationship with Mr. So.

598
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,872
We have to make him reach out.

599

<i>I hear Hanmin's</i>
<i>General Manager So Gyeong-dong</i>

602
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,765
<i>is actively supporting Hong Jang-mi.</i>

603
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,309
<i>They're hell-bent on catching the culprit.</i>

604
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:13,045
<i>General Manager So handed over</i>
<i>all the files to the FSS…</i>

605
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,133
<i>to clear Hanmin's name.</i>

THE HIDDEN TRUTH ABOUT
THE FEMALE HANMIN EMPLOYEE

608
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,727
WHAT WOULD SHE KNOW?
NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING

609
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,942
<i>No thief goes around</i>
<i>announcing they're a thief.</i>

610
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,614
<i>Using the high-school grad minion</i>
<i>as a scapegoat and firing her</i>

611
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,865
<i>is crossing the line.</i>

612
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,580
Ta-da.

613
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,832
Gosh, what are these?

614
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,921
- I'll take this one.
- Take this too.

615
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,716
Did you notice anything
particular about Mr. So?

616
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,552
Maybe he suddenly stepped out
with his cellphone?

617
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,971
Or had some lunch plans out of the blue?

618
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,810
He's glued to his desk
from the moment he comes into work.

619
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,687
It's like he's tied to that chair.

620
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,357
I also answer all his calls.

621
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,152
But…

622
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,737
But?

623
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,074
I kept hearing something vibrate
in his desk drawer.

624
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,284
Buzz-buzz. Like that.

625
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:27,995
I see.

626
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,463
No one's here because
the whole division is out for dinner.

627
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,423
Why didn't you go?

628
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,842
No one invited me.

629
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,887
They just don't know any better.

630
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,055
Clueless brainiacs.

631
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,558
I'll take it from here.
You guys can go home.

632
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,955
Another cellphone?

633
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,291
Go home, Bok-hee.

634
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,375
Take her home already.

635
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,110
MR. SO

636
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,573
Where are you going?

637
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,961
I told you not to call me
for the time being.

638
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,629
Why do you keep calling?

639
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,716
Yes, the FSS's internal probe is done.

640
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,968
But the company isn't,
so just stop fussing.

641
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,514
What, you don't believe me,

642
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,767
but you believe some online gossip rag?

643
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,770
Just why would I report you,
the CEO of Onemillion?

644
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,521
I'd be screwing myself over.

645
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,608
Who cares about the sale right now?

646
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,276
Oh my g--

647
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,508
Just lie low for the time being,

648
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,843
and get rid of your Myeongdong office.

649
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,553
Myeongdong?

650
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,872
<i>Was he directly involved in schemes</i>
<i>to create the slush fund?</i>

651
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,750
How did you know to target Mr. So?

652
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,544
What tipped you off?

653
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,216
<i>Could she have seen his name</i>
<i>in the slush fund ledger back then?</i>

654
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,885
I found it odd that the incident
occurred within his team,

655
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,930
but he stepped back and took
no responsibility as the general manager.

656
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,057
That made me wonder

657
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,978
who he was
actually working so hard to serve.

658
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,524
The lunch menu isn't the only decision
office workers have to make.

659
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,445
Maybe he had chosen complicity,
choosing to look the other way,

660
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,197
to go along with,
and take part in the wrongdoing.

661
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,742
I just thought you just
looked old for your age,

662
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,662
but now you sound like a manager
with at least ten years of experience.

663
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,624
I can't even imagine my thirties.

664
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,420
The Captain of Yeouido Pirates
left a comment

665
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,672
that mentioned Mr. So by name.

666
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,132
I see.

667
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,717
Wasn't that so fun though?

668
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,926
My heart's still racing.

669
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,220
Detective play is over now.

670
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,681
Over.

671
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,689
- Good morning.
- Yeah. Bonjour.

672
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,648
Maybe not?

673
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,985
Why is it still just Wednesday?

674
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,874

Ms. Hong, I'd like to help.
Please call me back when you hear this.

00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,344
Please.

679
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,807
You want to help her?
Do you want to know how?

680
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,976
Yes.

681
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,985
Help her review the wanted ads
and update her résumé.

682
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,571
She might actually be out
for an interview today.

683
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,823
Ms. Hong would never.

684
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,997
I wonder what she's up to.

Maybe.

00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,686
Maybe not.

693
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,938
Is he your husband?
He must be cheating on you!

694
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,731
- Must be a runaway little brother.
- A little…

695
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,901
How could he be younger than me? He looks…

Let me see.

700
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,384
No, that's clearly not him.

701
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,594
Maybe not?

702
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,928
Never mind then.

703
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,847
- Lunch delivery.
- Over here.

704
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,601
Do you want to eat?

705
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,810
No, thank you.

PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION

708
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,153
He was granted parole due to diabetes?

709
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,237
Yeah.

710
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,197
I noticed he was
quite a picky eater that day.

711
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,409
He even has alarms set up
for his medication.

712
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,829
RESTAURANT

713
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,290
Did anyone who looked like him ask

714
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,335
for a special delivery time
or multigrain rice?

715
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,086
Yes, multigrain rice.

716
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,255
That's him all right.

717
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,216
Do you remember his address by any chance?

718
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,218
QUICK PRIVATE LOANS!

719
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,446
Damn. He already ran off.

720
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,205
Darn it.

721
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,269
Score.

722
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,488
What is all this?

723
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,657
You're up?

724
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,040
I stole it.

Found it.

728
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:52,958
You got something?

729
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,143
I'm submitting an off-site work request
on Jang-mi's behalf.

730
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,979
OFF-SITE WORK REQUEST

731
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,606
Again?

732
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,483
Without my approval?

733
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,444
Where has she gone today?

734
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:32,956
Aunt…

735
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,296
You know where she is, right?

Mr. Pak Ki-soo?

00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,120
Yes?

741
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,836
Why is he running away?

742
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,256
Sir! Just a second, sir!

743
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,760
Damn it. What the hell?

Oh no. My gosh.

747
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:23,669
Oh gosh.

748
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,132
What are you doing here, Mr. Oh?

749
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,967
No, why are you here?

750
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,930
I saw in Hollywood action flicks…

751
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,601
And…

752
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,606
You need stuff like this.

753
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,402
- I see.
- Yeah.

754
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,075
Yeah.

755
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,160
Thank you.

756
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,546
I think it'd be best if I come with you.

757
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,174
I'll call for you if I need help.

758
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,094
Yeah? Okay.

759
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,436
Jeez.

760
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,104
Let's see here.

761
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,110
This is a preview of the charges

762
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,070
you'll be facing.

763
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,323
CONVICTED IN INSURANCE FRAUD CASE

764
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,658
You can't get on that plane anyway.

765
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,309
Come on. Come at me.

766
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,603
Come on now!

767
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,984
Now, you'll walk back in there
and pick up the papers.

768
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,533
It's 102 pages in total.

769
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,452
With all that, your arrest warrant
will be out in a jiffy.

770
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,204
You're still on probation.

771
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,957
If you want to avoid a heavier sentence,
I suggest we wrap up here.

772
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,584
Here.

773
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,836
ORDER CANCELLATION AGREEMENT

774
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,258
Sign it. Now thumbprint.

775
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,217
But

776
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,010
who are you anyway?

777
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,392
I'm Hong Jang-mi from Risk Management
at Hanmin Investment & Securities.

778
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,065
It's the order cancellation agreement.

779
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,364
As expected, Ms. Hong.

780
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,370
ORDER CANCELLATION AGREEMENT

781
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,705
SIGNED: PAK KI-SOO

782
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,165
I knew you could do it, Ms. Hong.

783
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:54,754
The voicemail you left me
was very encouraging, Mr. Lee.

784
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,591
You heard it?

785
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,218
It's real.

786
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,345
How did you get him to sign this?

787
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,263
Did you do something, Big Al?

788
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,140
Me?

789
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,600
I just stood outside.

790
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,438
I'd also like to submit
this supplemental report on the incident.

791
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,653
Amazing.

792
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,619
I can't do it.

793
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,371
You submit it to the president yourself.

794
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,123
Why would I?

795
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,250
I didn't do anything,
so it feels weird to submit it.

796
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,086
You know, in Hollywood action flicks,

797
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,714
when the protagonist
finds themselves in danger,

798
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,174
their partner pops out of nowhere.

799
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,967
Just like how you did.

800
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,886
That's what gives you
the right to submit it.

801
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,598
"Partner"?

802
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,600
Yes. Partner.

803
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,774
Go on, partner.

804
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:02,989
Part…

805
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,741
Partner…

806
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,202
Partner…

807
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,330
Partner…

808
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,499
Partner…

809
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,212
- Jeez.
- You made quite an effort.

810
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,174
Yes, because I'm a partner.

811
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,556
As promised, can we call off
Ms. Hong's termination?

812
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,060
We'll see how she does
during her probationary period.

813
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,689
By the way,

814
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,316
about the recommended improvements
at the end of the report…

815
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,194
"The development of
an internal system that blocks orders

816
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,863
when the selling price
falls outside the market range."

817
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,952
Why don't we have Risk Management
spearhead that project?

818
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:49,995
Pardon?

819
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,039
Us?

820
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,470
Why do we keep finding more work?

821
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,806
That's what happens
when you suggest improvements.

822
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,474
That's a basic part of a report.

823
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,645
I was so inspired
after reading your report.

824
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,946
Maybe the president
recognized our hidden potential?

825
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,740
I wish he didn't.

826
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,534
All right. That's enough work talk.

827
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,539
The highlight of today!

828
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,251
- Mr. Bang!
- Yeah!

829
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,587
- Next is Mr. Lee!
- Thank you.

830
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,007
Finally, our Ms. Hong.
Congratulations on your first paycheck.

831
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:44,966
Applause!

832
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,220
Okay.

833
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,723
<i>The intensity of my workload has doubled,</i>

834
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,184
<i>but my paycheck has reduced by 70%.</i>

835
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,856
This will be the last month for pay stubs.

836
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,983
The president wants it all digitized.

837
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,110
You can check on the intranet from now on.

838
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,278
How about a team dinner tonight?

839
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,614
We should celebrate
since it's Ms. Hong's first payday.

840
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,491
- That sounds great.
- What would you like?

841
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,868
I'm not going. I'm clocking out now.

Wow.

847
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,602
Regarding what I told you
about Ms. Hong earlier,

848
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,774
there are a few things
I would like to clarify.

849
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,359
Go ahead.

850
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,238
She lacks interpersonal skills
and is indeed stubborn,

851
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,156
but she's very dedicated
when it comes to work.

852
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,116
Is that so?

853
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,952
The company-wide

854
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,079

you brought to my attention.

855
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,914
Who came up with that idea?

856
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,376
I brainstormed it with Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

857
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,087
The brainwork was about 6:4.

858
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,506
And of course, I was the six.

859
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:15,306
You said she was also the one
who told you that I liked pizza, right?

860
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,268
Yes, that was all her. 100%.

861
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,693
You may leave.

00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,853
the trading system will be reinforced.

867
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,147
What about the girl who blew this up?

868
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,817
This is different
from what you promised me.

869
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,653
I believe we should prioritize
silencing the unnecessary rumors.

870

Division Manager Oh is
surprisingly ambitious

874
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,582
and a good leader.

875
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,417
Yes, President Shin.

876
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,922
Sir, it's just that
Albert never had the chance.

877
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,340
He does take after you

878
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,134
and a bit after me, a former
Ministry of Finance and Economy official.

879
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,054
With just a bit more experience,

880
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,473
he'll be able to take on
harder projects without issue.

881
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,935
They say, "Genius always shows."

882
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,520
You must be familiar with that saying.

883
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,813
You can all go back to work.

884
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,107
Ms. Song, you stay.

885
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,202

886
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,543
What should we do with Mr. So?

887
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:11,339
I'm well aware that you've
kept him by your side and cherished him

888
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,758

889
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,718

00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:30,233
I'll be sure to achieve greater results
than Mr. So without any mistakes--

894
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,318
President Shin Jung-woo…

895
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,824
must've figured out it was a scheme.

896
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,868
How about President Shin…

897
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,997
instead of General Manager So?

898
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,129
Has President Shin caught your eye?

899
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,593
I'm sure his studies abroad
and experience earning dollars

900
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,429
will set him apart somehow.

901
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,391
Also,

902
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,686
about the figurehead CEO of Onemillion…

903
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,190
Wrap that up for me, will you?

904
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,193
Yes, sir.

905
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,696
I will take care of it.

906
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,629
Whether it's making money for investors

907
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,672
or stealing it for the boss,

908
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,258
you'd better do it right, moving forward.

909
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,222
If we'd ended it
with Hong Jang-mi's disciplinary hearing,

910
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,600
there would've been no issue.

911
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:51,230
I heard that's what you told
the chairman as well.

912
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,528
She returned with a signed agreement
cancelling the three-billion-won order.

913
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,905
What grounds do we have left?

914
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,909
Scrutiny and harassment
of Ms. Hong Jang-mi

915
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,619
will no longer be tolerated.

916
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,456
Any veteran trader knows

917
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,042
that bad deals

918
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,002
must be dealt with swiftly.

919
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,519
What happened?

920
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,480
How could you sign that?

921
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:36,442
Some girl showed up with a fat file packed
with all the market manipulation evidence.

922
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,027
She even came into the men's room.

923
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,279
Screw that commission.

924
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,824
I'm done working with you.

925
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,920
- What do you want to eat?
- Let's get barbecue.

926
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,046
Let's go all out.

927
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:07,098
Why don't we call Mi-sook
and go out for dinner together?

928
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,891
I'd like to treat you all.

929
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,601
It's payday.

930
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,354
Really? That sounds great.
What should we get?

931
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,023
I wanted to head home early
because I'm so tired today.

932
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,572
You already know, right?

933
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,032
The one treating better have a fat wallet.

934
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,118
Of course.

935
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,103
Did you buy that camcorder?
It looks really expensive.

936
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,692
I'm just borrowing it.

937
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,651
Aunt…

938
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,365
You know where she is, right?

939
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,056
KIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

940
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,225
It wasn't free.

941
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,144
Nothing's free in this world.

942
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,355
You heard me, right?
We need to eat up today.

943
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,817
It's actually been a really long time
since I've asked someone

944
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,068
to share a meal.

945
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,531
Choose your dessert.

946
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,617
I'm not surprised.

947
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,285
You look like you have no friends.

948
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,380
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

949
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,524
The youngest shouldn't pay. Move it.

950
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,441
How much is the total?

951
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,776
I said I'd treat you all.

952
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:25,903
Just let her.

953
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,613
- But I can pay…
- Stop it.

954
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,575
Thank you.

955
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:33,953
Time for round two.

956
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,663
Round two?

957
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,637
I've never been to a rock cafe before.

958
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,432
Me neither.

959
01:04:56,767 --> 01:05:00,688
Can I just head back to the dorm?

960
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,691
I have some bible study to catch up on.

961
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:10,239
The Lord will always be by our side,
but youth is always fleeting.

962
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,241
They won't even let you in after 30.

963
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,536
Just like those geezers.

964
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,664
Leave.

965
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:22,585
Man, I'm just speechless over here.

966
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,129
You punk, do you know who we are?

967
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,298
How the hell would I know who you are?

968
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,384
What? What is it? Leave.

969
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,720
- Leave!
- What is he doing here?

970
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,055
Scram!

971
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,224
- Go. Get out of here. Damn it.
- Hey.

972
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,476
- Come on.
- Leave!

973
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,728
Hurry up and go!

974
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,818
ONE FREE BEER

975
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,374
Hi!

976
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,793
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

977
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,468
Should we play the truth game?

978
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,138
If you don't answer immediately,
you drink.

979
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:01,600
"I am interested in a man at work."

980
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,602
- No.
- No!

981
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,981
I heard the new president

982
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,859
is totally the heartthrob of Yeouido.

983
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,820
He's come a long way.

984
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,993
I overheard the middle-aged men
talk smack about him at work.

985
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:20,411
Right.

986
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,424
"I have a secret spot I go to

987
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,385
when I'm upset
and want to cry it out alone."

988
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,641
I have so many spots…

989
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,320
but yesterday, it was the burger place
farthest from the office.

990
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,826
I go to the safe.

991
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,455
<i>Even the scary customers</i>
<i>can't get back there.</i>

992
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,419
Mine is the last bus out.

993
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,178
They're all drunk and can't tell
if I'm crying or drooling anyway.

994
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,058
Jang-mi, I bet you don't have one yet.
You're still just a baby.

995
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:27,853
Mine is

996
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:32,191
the ladies' room on the B2 floor
of the library by my parents' place.

997
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,200
<i>I didn't want to upset my parents</i>
<i>by sticking around at home,</i>

998
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,203
<i>so I pretended to be busy</i>
<i>by going to the library every day.</i>

999
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,873
But sometimes,
all those emotions would choke me up.

1000
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,794
It was a long time ago.

1001
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,508
I guess the great Hanmin saved
a terrible, unemployed daughter.

1002
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,593
Come on. Let's drink.

1003
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,053
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

1004
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,268
I found you, my peacocks!

1005
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,397
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>How did that jerk get in here?</i>

1006
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,774
Where are you all from?
Do you want to hang out?

1007
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,236
Does he think he's a pigeon?

1008
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,450
We're college students.

1009
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:31,667
We're in the middle
of a serious conversation.

1010
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,294
I see. Understood.

1011
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,799
- Look at him waddling.
- Hello there.

1012
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,885
- What do you say to 4:3?
- Isn't he so ugly?

1013
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:42,761
Look. He just got rejected again.

1014
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,486
"We're college students."

1015
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,489
Wasn't that man so ugly?

1016
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:44,531
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1017
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,950
He was on the ugly side.

1018
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:48,118
What the hell?

1019
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,287
It's 11:45 right now.

1020
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,373
- Curfew!
- Curfew!

1021
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,666
Run!

1022
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,376
We need to hurry! Run!

1023
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,045
How would I know who she is?

1024
01:10:58,712 --> 01:10:59,964
She had the tackiest hairstyle.

1025
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,008
I'll look for another job.

1026
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,098
Get up.

1027
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:14,997
Let's go to our spot.

1028
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,432
Let's just accept
our demerit points and go in.

1029
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,558
It's just one point.

1030
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:37,686
Hey, I'll be evicted
with one more demerit point.

1031
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:39,563
There's a way in.

1032
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:51,492
How are we supposed to climb over
a 2-meter wall when we're only 160 cm?

1033
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,660
I want to try.

1034
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,787
What?

1035
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,704
Okay.

1036
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,290
The youngest should be our stepping stone.

1037
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:00,584
I think we can just step on that--

1038
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,266
Just step on this and climb up.

1039
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,226
Sorry.

1040
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:19,937
Be careful.

1041
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,663
Great. Thanks so much.

1042
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,499
Careful.

1043
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,959
Jeez. Hurry up already.

1044
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,889
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1045
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:06,817
What about Jang-mi?

1046
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:16,952
Nice catch.

1047
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,261
It's the RA. Hide!

1048
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:55,866
She's gone.

1049
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:09,463
Good job.

1050
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,594
Thank goodness.

1051
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,554
- That was close.
- I know, right?

1052
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:19,890
Jang-mi was so…

1053
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,732
What happened here?

1054
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,777
We must've been robbed.

1055
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:33,946
Oh no.

1056
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:43,580
This is why

1057
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,708
you should know your place and not act up.

1058
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,751
Who's in there?

1059
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,596
UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

1060
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,307
<i>I heard there is</i>
<i>an infiltrator in our company</i>

1061
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:27,142
<i>- who helped blow the whistle.</i>
- What?

1062
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,894
<i>- Are you hiding something?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

1063
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,812
<i>The higher-ups are looking for Yehppee.</i>

1064
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,691
<i>Both of you, bring me evidence</i>
<i>that proves you're innocent.</i>

1065
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:37,152
<i>We must find out who Yehppee is first.</i>

1066
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,029
Is there any chance
you know how to hack too?

1067
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,741
They might even search
the Outstanding Women Employees' Club.

1068
