1
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,963
UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

2
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,259
<i>The birth of Dolly, the lamb cloned</i>
<i>through genetic engineering…</i>

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>which demonstrated</i>
<i>the possibility of human cloning,</i>

4
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>and the successful landing</i>
<i>of a space probe on Mars</i>

5
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,976
<i>all happened in 1997.</i>

6
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,979
THE THIRD "COLLAPSE"

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,898
<i>As the new millennium dawned,</i>

8
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,109
<i>the world readied itself</i>
<i>amid great excitement and anxieties.</i>

9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,321
THE THIRD WAVE

10
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,951
CHO DU-PAL

11
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,995
<i>And there was a woman</i>

12
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>who sought a stunning turnaround,</i>
<i>stirring up waves of her own.</i>

13
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,050
What else? I'm working.

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,676
I'm on my way.

15
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,982
The Pitbull is on its way.

16
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,956
We can trust the witness, right?

17
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,834
Of course.
The witness is one smart cookie.

18
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,795
<i>All it takes is one word from me,</i>
<i>and it'll be done.</i>

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,509
To secure your acquittal, Mr. Cho,

20
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,927
the Financial Supervisory Service

21
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,512
will stand by you throughout.

22
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,444
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,284
Hey!

24
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,744
You should have makeup and a skirt on.

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,329
How unprofessional.

26
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,706
Wait, Mr. Cho.

27
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,041
- She doesn't work here.
- No?

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,042
She's the witness I mentioned earlier.

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,919
Gosh.

30
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,962
Should I leave?

31
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,505
- No, don't leave!
- No!

32
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:55,925
Coming in.

33
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,929
Let's all have a drink!

34
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,139
- Here we go.
- Excellent.

35
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,602
I would've chosen somewhere else
if I had known you were a woman.

36
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,396
Not at all, Mr. Cho.

37
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,316
Don't be fooled by her looks.
She's a total dude.

38
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,692
She's no woman.

39
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,822
All right then.

40
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,742
Here comes something major.

41
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,259
You can't change your tune tomorrow.

42
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,177
You heard that, right?

43
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,137
Yes, of course.

44
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,931
You know how I do.

45
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,309
The stage is perfectly set for tomorrow.

46
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,063
"I swear by my conscience
to speak the whole truth

47
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,773
and nothing but the truth."

48
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,193
"Should I lie,
I shall accept punishment for perjury."

49
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:56,945
I am Hong Keum-bo from

50
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,365
the Capital Market Investigation Division
at the Financial Supervisory Service.

51
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,953
The prosecution alleges

52
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,580
that Mr. Cho Du-pal manipulated
the stock price of MU Holdings,

53
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,666
but is it truly illegal to buy
an undervalued blue-chip stock low

54
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,459
and sell it at the upper limit?

55
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,462
What do you think, Ms. Hong?

56
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,264
WITNESS

57
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,225
It's blatant stock price manipulation

58
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,936
by combining corporate
and financial violations.

59
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,732
Ms. Hong,

60
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,609
please be reminded
that you're our witness.

61
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,945
"Our" witness?

62
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,740
PROSECUTOR

63
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:45,827
CHO DU-PAL

64
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,456
<i>- Are you Mr. Kim?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

65
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,666
<i>And the merch?</i>

66
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,502
<i>Let's grab a drink somewhere nice.</i>

67
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,878
As you can see, Mr. Cho Du-pal

68
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,632
was tipped off by an MU Holdings insider
through back channels,

69
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,301
and used it to line his own pockets.

70
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,390
I hereby submit evidence
demonstrating the procurement of funds

71
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,142
to manipulate
the stock price of MU Holdings

72
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,020
and the funneling of illicit profits
through other corporate entities.

73
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,772
And one more thing.

74
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,571
I'd also like to submit evidence
of him paying off

75
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,990
a Financial Supervisory Service employee.

76
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,533
Hold on!

77
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,243
You're no cop or prosecutor.

78
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,369
Who are you to act up?

79
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,163
I'd watch that tone of yours.

80
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,622
Why you little…

81
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,957
Let go of me!

82
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,792
Calm down.

83
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,877
Please calm down.

84
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,425
Calm down!

85
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,219
Please calm down!

Damn it!

88
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,601
Hey, Hong!

89
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,603
What was that about?

90
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,146
You blew it at the last moment!

91
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,564
Sir, what about the money--

92
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,523
What?

93
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,068
Damn you!

94
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,576
Hold on. That's my money.

95
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,119
My money…

96
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,372
Help me pick it up. It's mine. Hurry.

97
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,958
Hello?

98
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,001
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,461
What?

100
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,255
Hey, Hwang. It's me.

You're being accused of accepting bribes,

104
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,930
so you've been suspended from duty.

105
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,181
- Pardon?
- <i>Good luck.</i>

106
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,684
Wait, sir. Hello?

107
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,353
That was Director Yun, right?

108
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,230
I'll say my goodbyes here.

109
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,565
Wait. Hold on. Hey!

JULY 3, 1997, FINANCIAL DISTRICT, YEOUIDO

113
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,388
<i>Foreign capital is exiting swiftly</i>
<i>in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.</i>

114
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,765
<i>The mounting pressure</i>
<i>to service short-term foreign loans</i>

115
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,934

Here you go.

126
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,998
Three cartons of San Cigarettes, please.

127
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,334
It's for our boss.

128
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,514
Gosh.

129
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,557
I'll take a pair of tights too.

130
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,684
Oh, you can't. Those are reserved.

131
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,520
It should be first-come, first-served.

132
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,771
Let me have them.

HIGH ELASTICITY
SMILE TIGHTS

134
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,324
Sidewalks have limited space.

135
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,452
Maybe consider a single file
instead of side-by-side.

136
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,710
What's her deal?

137
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,817
I have two bits of good news and one bad.
Pick your choice.

138
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,778
Can we start with the good?

139
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,821
You have been promoted

140
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,073
to team manager
at the Financial Supervisory Service,

141
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,910
and confirmed probe into the slush fund
of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

142
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,371
I foresaw both.

143
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,581
And the bad news.

144
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,004
All your team members
have handed in their resignations.

145
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,674
They refuse to accept you
as their team manager.

146
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,677
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

147
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,556
You should process them.

148
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,266
Hey, kid.

149
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,811
They're my subordinates too.
They're our family.

150
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,895
Not for me.

151
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,024
How are we a family
when we never even shared a meal?

CAPITAL MARKET INVESTIGATION DIVISION

153
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,527
Hong Keum-bo, that ruthless brat.

154
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,780
How could she stab her boss in the back
to steal his job?

155
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,865
Listen.

156
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,326
She has no sense
of camaraderie or loyalty.

157
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,870
How can we serve
under someone we can't trust?

158
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,830
The Witch of Yeouido is coming.

159
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,547
You should be thanking your lucky stars
that you didn't go down with Hwang.

160
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,467
It was touch-and-go for you.

161
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,979
TEAM MANAGER HONG KEUM-BO

162
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,860
These are the resignations
you've submitted.

163
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,030
I guess you were
in such a rush to leave your jobs

164
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,824
that you completely ignored
the chain of command in this organization

165
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,077
and went straight
to the director's office.

166
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,880
Complaints are not exempt from protocol.

167
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,676
You all have two options at this point.

168
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,594
Option A.

169
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
"I refuse to serve
under that brat, Hong Keum-bo."

170
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,473
"Screw this. I quit."

171
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,516
Option B.

172
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,560
"Hong Keum-bo, that pitbull,
possesses neither camaraderie nor loyalty,

173
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,938
but I'll build myself
a lasting career with her

174
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,564
because she's good at her job."

175
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,529
Success requires talent, not faith.

176
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,746
We'll have a meeting in ten minutes.

177
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,087
Come to the meeting room

178
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,839
if you wish to work with me.

179
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,710
Good morning.

180
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,482
While investigating
the offshore shell companies

181
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,984
that diverted funds
for MU Holdings' stock price manipulation,

182
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,361
I uncovered a fascinating fact.

183
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,363
HANMIN CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM
SUED FOR ASSAULT BY FEMALE LAWYER

184
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,617
- There he is!
- Let's go!

185
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,328
Chairman Kang,
how do you respond to the allegations?

186
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,871
Do you care to comment?

187
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,749
CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

188
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,045
That case was already dismissed.

189
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,254
Due to that assault case,

190
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,507
he handed over
management rights to his only son.

191
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,177
Pildong was a new law firm
that was established only last November,

192
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,555
but they ended up
representing Chairman Kang.

193
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,473
Why?

194
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,266
Because its senior managing partner

195
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,560
worked as general counsel
for Hanmin until October.

196
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,021
Subsequently,
they were appointed as counsel

197
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,981
for three well-capitalized
shell companies.

198
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,068
We also suspect Hanmin
to be the source of their funds.

199
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,655
Hey, do you think Hanmin
is some ordinary corner shop?

200
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,032
You're poking a bear here.

201
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,661
Why would I ever pursue a corner shop?

202
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,333
HANMIN'S DECADE-LONG ALLEGATIONS

203
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,877
In the past decade, Hanmin,
long called the heart of Yeouido,

204
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,172
has been suspected
of stock price manipulation

205
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,549
five times.

206
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,677
Three associates implicated
in the cases died by suicide.

207
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,804
Victim count soars

208
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,932
if you include the retail investors
who lost money, time, and lives.

209
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,187
Slush funds estimated to have been
siphoned by the chairman's family alone

210
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,605
exceed 100 billion won.

211
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,277
How much longer must we let
this shameless looting slide?

212
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,196
It's time we do our jobs.

213
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,823
All right?

214
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,913
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

215
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,748
An internal probe
into Hanmin's slush fund?

216
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,334
The prosecution
and Financial Supervisory Service

217
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,128
have already formed a task force team.

218
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,047
CHIEF OF STAFF SONG JU-RAN
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

219
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,467
Thank goodness I still have junior alumni
out in the field right now.

220
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,636
Without me,
you'd never be privy to such intel.

221
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,555
Mr. Oh.

222
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,099
I guess your alumni
lacked the clout to stop it.

223
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,436
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OH DEOK-GYU
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

224
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,605
Despite our generous yearly
agency "upkeep" payoffs.

225
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,650
How could you know so little
when you're the chief of staff?

226
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,904
There's always that one guy
looking to earn a medal wherever you go.

227
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,155
Is this news to you?

228
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,783
It's just a pointless moral crusade
fueled by naked ambition.

229
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,120
And the bastard at the helm
has latched onto our company,

230
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,247
determined to drag it down.

231
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,957
Can we get the task force roster?

232
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,792
Of course. You know me.

233
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,127
I've already acquired it. Here.

234
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,135
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES
SLUSH FUND TASK FORCE

235
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,848
FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE:
YUN JAE-BEOM, HONG KEUM-BO…

236
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,268
I'll report this to the chairman myself.

237
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:41,148
Are you suggesting I let
the prosecution investigate me?

238
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,068
I believe this is our last chance

239
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,071
to right the wrongs we may have committed.

240
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,323
"Our chance"?

241
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,785
Are you sure this isn't you

242
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,372
taking your shot
to kick me out and take my place?

243
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,539
Father.

244
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,960
No one in this country would ever dare
to come after me, you punk.

245
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,878
This is my company.

246
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,005
I built it from the ground up…

247
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,716
"This company
does not belong to me alone."

248
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,887
"It belongs to
all of the Hanmin employees."

249
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,889
Those were your words.

250
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,641
Please reconsider.

251
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,394
Why you…

252
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,187
That punk.

253
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,355
Why I ought to…

254
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,212
Sir.

255
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,130
Thanks.

256
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,431
Are you all right?

257
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,187
Ms. Song.

258
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,398
Do you think Myeong-hwi…

259
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,860
could switch sides on me?

260
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,409
I'll keep an eye on him.

261
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,369
All right.

262
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,621
You do that.

263
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,793
We suspect two divisions in Hanmin,

264
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,880
the Trading and Research Divisions,

265
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,590
to have spearheaded the illicit trading.

266
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,885
We've confirmed that a portion
of the domestically acquired slush fund

267
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,095
was deposited into an account

268
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,140
belonging to Kang Pil-beom's
only daughter, Ms. Kang Nora.

269
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,141
An overseas account?

270
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,727
Yes, Kang Nora is a US citizen.

271
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,646
That'll take even more time
to investigate then.

272
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,070
Follow the trail of money
to uncover the corrupt instigator.

273
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,573
In order to secure solid evidence
that can substantiate the charges--

274
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,035
Right, so if you really wanted
to go after Hanmin,

275
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,163
you should've called me in
after securing concrete evidence.

276
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,290
Hong!

277
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,133
I'll be back after I secure it.

278
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,094
Take care, sir.

279
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,930
Evidence!

280
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,852
He's so damn obnoxious.

281
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,105
That's bookworms for you.

282
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,067
You're not any less.

283
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,444
But still, without him,

284
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,072
this investigation into Hanmin
would've never taken off.

285
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,533
That's why I'm biting my tongue.

286
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
What's with the attitude?

287
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,374
Then again, you got solid grades too.

288
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,919
Let's hurry up.
The president is waiting for us.

289
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,130
It's not like he's waiting out
in the hot sun.

290
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,673
GENERAL MANAGER SO GYEONG-DONG
TRADING DIVISION, HANMIN

291
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,216
MANAGER BANG JIN-MOK
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION, HANMIN

292
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,759
GENERAL MANAGER CHA JUNG-IL
RESEARCH DIVISION, HANMIN

293
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,512
He's comfortably waiting for us
in his office.

294
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,513
Hey, Bang.

295
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,807
At least tuck that darn shirt in,
will you?

296
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,809
Mind your potbelly first.

297
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,854
Big Al should be at this thing, not me.

298
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,480
What does he know?

299
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,109
The fact that we three were called
means it's an emergency.

300
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,402
- Let's go already.
- Come on.

301
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,991
We hear a full-scale investigation
into both breach of fiduciary duty

302
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,534
and illicit trading is underway.

303
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,579
We'll respond accordingly,

304
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,082
but since Trading and Research
are core divisions,

305
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,293
you will need to
prepare further independently.

306
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,253
Understood.

307
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,922
Will do.

308
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,174
Is there actually a slush fund?

309
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,391
Even if there is one…

310
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,938
we must make it not exist.

311
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,278
First, I'd like to ask Risk Management

312
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,990
to look into the task force members.

313
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,868
As in dig for dirt?

314
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,827
Whatever comes up.

315
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,871
Find out as much as you can.

320
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,979
Cheers!

321
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,522
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

323
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,770
NEW MAIL FROM YEHPPEE@KEBEO.CO.KR

324
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,688
"Yehppee"?

325
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,939
TIP: REGARDING HANMIN'S SLUSH FUND

326
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:05,991
<i>I have the accounting ledger</i>
<i>that proves the Kang family's corruption.</i>

327
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,037
<i>Let's talk in person.</i>

328
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,644
Are you Yehppee?

329
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,400
No.

330
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,074
Inspector Hong?

331
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,582
President Kang,

332
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,127
plea bargaining should be done
with the prosecution.

333
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,130
Guilt needs to be proven
before any bargaining, no?

334
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,673
You've got a long way to go.

335
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,428
Oh, I get it.

336
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,430
Is there a box of cash in your trunk?

337
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,058
Overflowing with fresh and green bills?

338
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,938
I have something even better.

339
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,859
How about the slush fund ledger?

340
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,778
The slush fund ledger?

341
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,536
Why aren't you answering it?

342
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,037
That will be my assistant calling.

343
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,583
My assistant is always by my side,
fully aware of what I do and whom I meet.

344
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,170
But I left today without saying anything.

345
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,465
I wanted to see

346
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,553
if you were someone
who could be entrusted with a life…

347
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,517
for myself.

348
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,480
Whose life?

349
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,150
Chairman Kang Pil-beom's?

350
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,026
Or yours?

351
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,127
I'm talking about Hanmin's.

352
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,965
You could end up receiving
a prison sentence.

353
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,634
Yes. I'm prepared for as much.

354
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,472
"Follow the trail of money
to uncover the corrupt instigator."

355
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,642
Those were your words.

356
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,939
Follow the trail of money
to uncover the corrupt instigator.

357
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,734
Do we have a damn rat?

358
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,278
If they're not stopped now,
they'll siphon off the money

359
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,739
even more carefully and systematically.

360
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,950
To prevent that from happening,
Yehppee and I

361
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,536
<i>are getting the ledger together</i>
<i>for whistleblowing purposes.</i>

362
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,251

363
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,838
our last chance

364
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,175
to flip the tables.

365
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,232
If you're messing with me,

366
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,067
or if you ever betray me in the future,

367
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,862
you and I will both be
swimming with the fishes in the Han River.

368
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,614
I plan to live

369
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,743
a long, honest life with integrity.

370
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,137
What's this?

371
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,807
Consider it a welcome gift.

HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

373
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,075
After you requested solid evidence
that outlines the flow of funds,

374
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,537
I was able to confirm a few details
of the funds Hanmin leaked abroad.

375
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,164
You're quick.

376
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,668
You asked for evidence, didn't you, sir?

377
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,379
We'd like to request

378
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,840
a search and seizure warrant
based on evidence of funds diverted

379
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,426
to Ms. Kang Nora's personal account
and offshore corporations.

380
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,635
Yes, all right.

384
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,326
Let's meet up at our spot tonight.

385
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,661
All right.

386
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,425
Multivitamin, amino acids,
and deer antler extract, sir.

387
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,471
Thank you.

388
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,981
I sometimes think about

389
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,109
what would've happened
if I had finished med school.

390
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,446
The chairman would've bought a hospital.

391
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,700
I wouldn't have been a good doctor.

392
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,417
I heard you were picked
as the Outstanding Woman Employee.

393
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,919
Congratulations.

394
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,337
It's a cash bonus.

395
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,588
Oh my.

396
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,759
You did manage to become a good boss.

397
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,345
Thank you.

398
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,146
I think President Kang has a woman.

399
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,189
Who?

400
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,360
I'm not sure,
but he's been seeing her regularly.

401
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,030
I heard him setting up a date for tonight.

402
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,033
All right.

403
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,762
You can pick up the slush fund ledger

404
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,557
at the president's office
on the 12th floor

405
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,143

406
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,191

416
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,821
I knew you'd show up in this dismal state.

417
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,364
Good morning to you, too, Dad.

418
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,741
You weren't drinking all night, right?

419
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,909
I didn't drink at all.

420
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,704
I saw three late-night movies in Jongno.

421
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,707
Change before you go up

What's with this emergency meeting?

423
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,421
Are all the geezers here already?

424
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,380
Why you…

425
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,591
Take care of that for me.

426
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,093
I'm worried he's too good-looking,
just like me.

427
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,187
Put your game away.

428
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,649
Read the room. The chairman is coming!

429
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,382
Don't you all have brains
between those ears?

430
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,092
Are your hands and feet just for show?

431
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,971
How could I have been informed

432
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,600
of the prosecution's search and seizure

433
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,769
just three hours
before it's supposed to happen?

434
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,521
I actually acquired intel
that the prosecution

435
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,650
was carrying out a probe a few days ago.

436
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,859
And?

437
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,321
President Kang said
he wanted to tell you himself.

438
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,073
He insisted.

439
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,783
What did you just say?

440
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,870
Myeong-hwi knew about this?

441
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,830
Yes, sir.

442
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,334
Where is he right now?

443
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,294
Well, I…

444
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,713
I'll give him a call, Grandfather.

445
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,552

446
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,431

You should've told me that sooner,
you punk.

454
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,008
I wanted to secure the evidence first.

455
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,891
He told me he'd leave
the slush fund ledger

456
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,351
in his office on the 12th floor.

457
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,187
We just need to get it
during today's search and seizure--

458
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,439
Seriously?

459
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,566
You expect me to proceed with that search?

460
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,861

of the great Chairman Kang is dead!

461
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,363

about President Kang's accident,

The press has turned on us
after President Kang's death.

470
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,982
They're even saying the pressure
from the investigation led him to suicide.

471
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,860
It wasn't suicide. If anything, homicide--

472
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,154
You're in no place to make such calls.

473
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,406
What if it wasn't an accident?

474
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,825
What if Chairman Kang stepped in
after he discovered

475
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,412
that President Kang
had decided to join forces with us?

476
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,082
- Hey.

You've been a career woman long enough.
It's time to get married.

The blind date
you ruthlessly turned down last year

00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,508
just had a baby boy.

525
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,969
Apparently, people call that
a "honeymoon baby."

526
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,265
If you'd just been a bit nicer to him,
that would've been your baby.

00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,911
<i>On July 22nd,</i>
<i>the legal community weighed in,</i>

534
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,830
<i>stating that the prosecution</i>

535
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,666
<i>must have arrived at this decision</i>
<i>due to insufficient discovery</i>

536
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,251
<i>after their search and seizure…</i>

537
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,669
It's not too late.

538
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,629
Anything's possible
between a man and a woman.

539
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,341
Just start dating.
You need to start to progress.

540
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,052
We actually just received
another blind date offer.

541
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,304
The deaconess's paternal cousin's
daughter-in-law's

542
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,472
maternal cousin's brother.

543
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,806
- It's too good to pass up.
- Yes.

544
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,516
Let's proceed. Set a date.

545
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,684
I should get going.

546
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,812
Hold on. Take this with you.

547
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,025
This is kimchi,

548
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,526
and this is boiled chicken.

549
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,321
The weather's warm,
so put it straight in the fridge.

550
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,281
I didn't bring my car.

551
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,871
<i>Beyond the Han River, to the World!</i>
<i>To the Future!</i>

552
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,332
That's a talisman for attracting men.

553
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,876
I had to fry ten extra chickens
to pay for this.

554
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,504
Do you really think that would work?

555
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:45,299
Would you really want a son-in-law
who was drawn to me not out of love,

556
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,884
but only because of that talisman?

557
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,135
You think I want to do this?

558
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,429
Your married friends
already have kids in school.

559
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,349
Mom, I have no friends.

560
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,351
Unbelievable.

561
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,436
It attracts men.
You want me to carry it around?

562
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,147
Why would I carry it around?
I have no need for it at all.

563
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,357
HANMIN IS LOOKING FOR ASPIRING TALENT

564
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,157
Jeez, my mom's really something else.

565
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,661
Hey!

566
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,996
You damn punks!

567
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,331
Damn it!

568
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,418
Did you just get mugged?

569
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,335
Yes.

570
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,838
- Get in.
- Thank you.

571
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,051
What are you doing?

572
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,929
Hurry up and get in.

573
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,307
You can go. I'm fine.

574
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,314
Damn it.

575
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,532
This is why

576
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,369
you should know your place and not act up.

577
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,079
You know?

578
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,306
You little…

579
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,950
- Come here.
- You're dead.

580
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,480
<i>The late Brother Peter Kang Myeong-hwi,</i>

581
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,857
a servant of the Lord
who became one with God,

582
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,779
strove to live out the Word of God
as taught in Sacred Scripture.

583
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,657
Let us pray for our brother Peter,

584
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,410
who, having been called home by the Lord,

585
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,413
departed from the side of his loved ones
at his young age.

586
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,545
May our brother Peter,
and all the faithful departed,

587
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:31,757
through the mercy of God,
come to rest in the peace of eternal life.

588
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,092
Amen.

589
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,552
- Amen.
- Amen!

590
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:37,972
What's wrong with you?

591
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,848
- Damn, that startled me.
- Sit.

592
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,433
Unbelievable.

593
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,686
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down.

594
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:08,502
I thought today was just for family.

595
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,839
MADAM CHOI IN-JA
CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM'S EX-WIFE

596
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,132
Is this any place

597
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:18,053
for the chairman's ex-wife,
who divorced him 20 years ago, to be?

598
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,221
I do wonder.

599
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,806
We still have our Nora.

600
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,100
I had to be here as her mother.

601
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,685
After all, our Nora

602
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,271
is the chairman's only child now.

603
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,444
You were kicked out of here ages ago.

604
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,322
I was never kicked out.
I walked out on my own.

605
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,907
Albert's mother passed forever ago.

606
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,785
Yet here you are, still pathetically
leeching off your in-law.

607
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,580
You dare raise your voices in my house?

608
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,420
Sit.

609
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,512
If Nora survives

610
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,391
the three-month probationary period

611
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,103
and becomes a full-time employee
at Hanmin Investment & Securities,

612
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,900
then I'll let you inherit
the shares of the company

613
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,319
that I intended to pass down
to Myeong-hwi.

614
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,864
My goodness. Nora.

615
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,909
But, sir.

616
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,328
Nora didn't even major in business.

617
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,705
But Albert, who studied business
and did nothing else,

618
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,916
works at the company too.

619
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,293
Didn't you drop out
before you even got that degree?

620
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,336
Yes.

621
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,254
- See?
- Come on now.

622
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,633
Nora.

623
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,218
When you were little,

624
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:43,222
your mother paraded you around,
and everyone knew your face.

625
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,850
But the only ones
who know what you look like now

626
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,353
are in this room.

627
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,563
Thus,

628
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,358
you must not let on
that you're my daughter.

629
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,860
And follow Ms. Song's guidance

630
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,655
to prepare for your next step, all right?

631
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:05,994
We're done here.

632
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,788
Wait, sir.

633
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,957
I implore you to reconsider.

634
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,167
You do not get a say!

635
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,088
You just focus on preparing
for the press conference.

636
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,803
Nora, this worked out so well.

637
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,763
Congratulations on your new job, Auntie.

638
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,807
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

639
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,525
Mom, I can't do it.

640
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,776
I don't want to work there.

641
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,528
Send me back to America.

642
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,363
Be quiet.

643
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,740
You said you wanted to spend your life

644
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,659
burning through the money
your father never spent on you.

645
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:48,579
If you give up and surrender now,

646
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:52,207
Albert will take this house,
the company, and everything else. Got it?

647
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,630

649
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,347
Damn, seriously?

650
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,310
Keum-bo!

651
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,022
Hold on.

652
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,274
Are you okay?

653
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,067
Have I been admitted?

654
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,987
WISHING YOU A SPEEDY RECOVERY
GET BETTER SOON

655
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,577
Maybe someone at Hanmin

656
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,997
found out about you and President Kang?

657
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,999
That asshole prosecutor
was attacked last night.

658
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,834
He has a 12-week recovery ahead of him.

659
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,711
This is undoubtedly a warning.

660
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,757
They're saying they'll come after you
if you go after them.

661
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,345
But you know,

662
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,598
they must be doing this
because there's something to hide.

663
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,808
What exactly are you trying to say?

664
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,936
What if we go in person

665
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,188
to retrieve the slush fund ledger?

666
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,440
Who? How in the world would we do that?

667
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,942
Look at the state I'm in right now.

668
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,204

HANMIN AWAITS
MOTIVATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

670
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,547
We'll keep it a secret from the office.

671
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,341
It'll be a secret operation
with just you and me.

672
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,595
You can't see
what's right under your nose.

673
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,765
They wouldn't imagine you doing this
in their wildest dreams.

674
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,565
I won't be under their noses.
I'll be stuck in a death trap.

675
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,402
Do you really think President Kang
died in a car accident?

676
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,029
Also, I'm a well-educated woman.

677
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,448
I'm a career woman with ten years
of experience in Yeouido!

678
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,659
And you want me to go undercover

679
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,411
as some entry-level minion?

680
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,710
- Damn it!
- But I like the plan…

681
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,004
Wait. Hold on, Hong.

682
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,171
Hong! Stop!

683
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,426
Hong! Come on! Wait!

684
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,848
Hong!

685
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,852

<i>Take it easy.</i>

690
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,010
<i>I'll take care of everything.</i>

691
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,563
Where did she go?

692
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,443
Jeez, where the hell did she go?

693
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,704
Director Yun!

694
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,709
All right, sorry. I was shortsighted.

695
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,378
Of course, this wouldn't work.

696
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,422
I mean, you're 35.

697
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,175
Who would ever think
you're in your twenties?

698
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,760
Maybe a mom of a 20-year-old.

699
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,097
Sir.

700
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,642
For the record,
everyone says I look young for my age.

701
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,937
Everyone thinks I'm in my twenties.
They're so shocked when they hear my age.

702
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,984
Why am I explaining myself?

703
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,112
So?

704
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,322
Are you saying
you'll give it serious consideration?

705
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,365
No.

706
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,451
If you want it so badly, do it yourself.

707
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,997
What's this?

708
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,499
I'M TAKING PTO

709
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,876
Wait, hold on. Hong Keum-bo!

710
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,171
CHAIRMAN KANG PIL-BEOM'S
NATIONAL PRESS CONFERENCE

711
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,215
I devoted my entire life

712
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,929
to serving the national economy
and improving the lives

713
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,724
of the people.

714
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,685
<i>There may have been mistakes,</i>

715
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,937
<i>but there was no illegality.</i>

716
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,983
<i>At this moment,</i>

717
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,985
<i>I'm just a man</i>

718
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,654
<i>who lost his one and only son</i>

719
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,658
and failed as a father.

720
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,799
BREAKING NEWS: HANMIN CHAIRMAN KANG
APOLOGIZES TO THE NATION

721
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,635
Even nine years ago,

722
00:50:56,303 --> 00:51:00,098
nefarious forces slandered and attacked

723
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,142
<i>Hanmin Investment & Securities.</i>

724
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,520
<i>However, it was all a lie.</i>

725
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,023
<i>And again, this time,</i>

726
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,525
<i>I, Kang Pil-beom,</i>

727
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,236
<i>will not settle.</i>

728
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,282
Hanmin Investment & Securities
is a VIP client at our accounting firm.

729
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,409
- Please take good care of us.
- Thank you.

730
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,037
<i>…committed suicide</i>
<i>by jumping from his apartment building.</i>

731
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,456
<i>She reported Hanmin for accounting fraud,</i>

732
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,374
<i>but their countersuit ruined her.</i>

733
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,294
<i>I will continue to</i>

734
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:35,133
stand firm against schemes,
fabrications, and betrayal.

735
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,095
I will carry on Kang Myeong-hwi's legacy

736
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,765
with unwavering determination

737
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,518
<i>to bring forth</i>
<i>a new Hanmin Investment & Securities</i>

738
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:50,273
that will be worthy
of the Republic of Korea's stature.

739
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,025
FRAUD AND SLUSH FUND CHARGES ARE BASELESS!

740
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,777
KANG, THE "PHOENIX OF YEOUIDO,"
PREPARES A COMEBACK

741
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,548
I'll proceed
with the Hanmin undercover investigation.

742
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,091
You've been informed.

743
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,763
My goodness.

744
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,975
You refused to even budge
when I begged you.

745
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,769
Now that it's a hot mess, you want to go?

746
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,063
That ship has sailed.

747
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,147
It's all over.

748
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,361
And they concluded the investigation
into President Kang's car accident.

749
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,823
But that was no accident.

750
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,745
If I'm being honest,
I didn't trust him 100%.

751
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,372
I only realized he was being genuine

752
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,709
after he died
and Yehppee went into hiding.

753
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,545
You saw Chairman Kang's
press conference, right?

754
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,796
Even nine years ago,

755
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,799
nefarious forces slandered and attacked

756
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,927
Hanmin Investment & Securities.

757
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,014
However, it was all a lie.

758
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,974
What happened nine years ago
can't happen again.

759
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,146
I'll find Yehppee within three months…

760
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,775
and retrieve the slush fund ledger.

761
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,303
All documents
once submitted to President Kang

762
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,429
have been shredded.

763
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,140
And the police have quietly concluded

764
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,309
his traffic accident investigation.

765
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,769
Now,

766
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,355
who knows about the slush fund details

767
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,651
and the hidden cache?

768
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,652
Only you…

769
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,655
and me, sir.

770
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,576
Betrayal

771
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,413
is unacceptable.

772
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,258
People often think otherwise,

773
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,136
but my first

774
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,098
and most cherished son…

775
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,018
has always been Hanmin.

776
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,575
I can't believe this brat.

777
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,161
You'd think she was robbed.

778
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,788
Jeez.

779
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,251
Look at all these flashy clothes.

780
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:01,006
Gosh, this will fall apart
as soon as you wear it.

781
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,136
This room is a mess.

782
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,805
What is this?

783
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,183
She must be sweeping up
all the dirt in the world with these.

784
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,685
Gross.

785
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,610
Ripped jeans…

786
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,987
What are you doing in my room?

787
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,204
Jeez.

788
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,963
I said, what are you doing in my room?

789
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,216
I was just stopping by and…

790
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,765
Stop it.

791
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,892
What's wrong with your arm?

792
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,810
I injured it recently.

793
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:58,897
So it hurts?

794
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,611
SHINING PINK BOLERO
RAGLAN SLEEVE CARDIGAN

795
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,074
CROPPED TEE, WIDE JEANS
POPULAR SKINCARE

796
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,619
What's this?

797
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,538
Hey.

798
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,457
No grown-up should let
their belly hang out like that.

799
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,834
Well…

800
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,880
Do you think you can help me out?

801
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,174
Truth is,

802
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,010
I'm looking to adopt
a more youthful style.

803
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,680
Why?

804
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,641
Are you trying to change your look
to land a husband?

805
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,229
Just shut up and do it for the money.

806
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:45,819
First off,

807
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,697
let's do something
about this lifeless hair.

808
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,916
Hello there.

809
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,919
So have you decided?

810
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,379
I…

811
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,090
Allow me to make a recommendation then.

812
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,550
Just a moment.

813
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:09,592
HAIR STYLES FOR WOMEN IN 30S

814
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,804
How about something like this?

815
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,307
To accentuate the mature charm
of a woman in her thirties--

816
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,392
She's 20.

817
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,435
Pardon?

818
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,480
I'm 20.

819
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,569
Sure. Just a moment.

820
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:34,075
This will accentuate the charm of Gen X.

821
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,161
What do you think about this style?

822
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,454
She'll go with that one.

823
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,330
Sure.

824
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,041
The final test happens
after the hair and makeup.

825
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,543
The final test?

826
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,874
FATEFUL ENCOUNTERS

<i>I never fail to get carded</i>
<i>at movie theaters and video stores.</i>

828
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,300
You'll know you're passing for 20
when you get carded.

829
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,599
Welcome.

830
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,808
Hello.

831
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,314
MUST BE 19 OR OVER TO RENT

832
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,030
TO YOU FROM ME

833
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,827
I really have to watch this tonight.

834
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,745
You'll let me take it, won't you?

835
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,083
No.

836
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,627
I've also been waiting for tonight
for a long time.

837
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,674
I grabbed it first.

838
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,718
I don't think so.

839
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,511
- Sir.
- Sir.

840
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,059
TO YOU FROM ME

841
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:17,989
I'm going to

842
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,492
need to check your ID, miss.

843
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,370
This isn't meant for minors.

844
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,754
I wish you a lovely,
passionate night by yourself.

845
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,300
Hormones run rampant at your age.

846
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,263
Was she talking about me?

847
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,019
This is a masterpiece.

848
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,687
It is.

849
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,564
It's a masterpiece of film.

850
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,651
It is with unbiased eyes.

FEMALE STAFF RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

858
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,508
The top and bottom scorers
are interviewing together.

859
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:47,764
Hong Jang-mi got 297 on the written exam.

860
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,351
You only got the last
accounting question wrong.

861
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,479
Meanwhile,

862
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,941
Kang Eun-joo got a score of 210…

863
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,277
I mean, 21 points.

864
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,699
What's the point of interviewing?

865
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,284
You should never hire the top scorer.

866
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,913
What use would we have
with a young, smart woman?

867
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,290
She's young but looks old.

868
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,877
She'll never be carded on cigarette runs.

869
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,884
- Ji-eun.
- Yes?

870
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,261
You worked under Deputy Manager Kim.
I know him well.

871
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,554
Yes, that's right.

872
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,806
- Ms. Lee Eun-yeong?
- Yes?

873
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,350
Do you prefer it boneless
or with the bone?

874
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,976
- Ms. Seo Eun-su.
- Yes?

875
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,436
You're a former Miss Chunhyang?

876
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,063
I was first runner-up.

877
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,356
It's a pleasure to meet you.

878
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,085
- Let's wrap up.
- Sure.

879
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,670
Excuse me.

880
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,882
I wasn't asked a single question.

881
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,261
Candidate 504 next to me wasn't, either.

882
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,137
You want a question?

883
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,350
Bill Gates.

884
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,602
You've heard of him, right?

885
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,398
What is the name of the company
that Microsoft, led by Bill Gates,

886
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:23,860
recently invested 150 million dollars in?

887
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,239
Apple!

888
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,453
It's Apple.

889
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:39,292
Steve Jobs recently came back on as CEO.

890
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,879
Ms. Kang Eun-joo,

891
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,547
what a thoughtful response.

892
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,509
You may all leave.

893
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,479
Thank you.

894
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,786
This way.

895
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,293
Come on now.

896
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,962
It's time to leave.

897
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:29,091
I didn't get that last
accounting question wrong.

898
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,844
The question itself was wrong.

899
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,973
The answer wasn't in the multiple choice,
so I wrote it down separately.

900
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:48,235
Please don't tell me
I was the only one who noticed

901
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,988
the error in that question.

902
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,665
MEETING ROOM
DO NOT ENTER

903
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,920
She's just some 20-year-old
commercial high school grad.

904
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:09,256
How dare she question
the accuracy of our data?

905
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,718
The answer is 27.
It's not one of the choices.

906
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,720
What? Seriously?

907
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,933
The Research Division
is in charge of the exam questions.

908
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,936
Ms. Go, you're in charge of proofreading.
Did you slack off?

909
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,021
I submitted a report
noting a question error,

910
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,399
along with the solution
and the correct answer.

911
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,735
No, I've never received such a report.

912
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,030
I guess Old Maid Go's mind is slipping.

913
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:34,740
Have you gotten forgetful?

914
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,953
Where did she write her answer though?

915
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,831
<i>P. S.</i>

916
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:45,167
<i>Please conduct a thorough review</i>
<i>of exam questions next time.</i>

917
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,503
There.

918
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,227
What should we do about Hong Jang-mi?

919
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,864
<i>Please input your exam ID number.</i>

920
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,786
<i>Exam ID 505. Ms. Hong Jang-mi.</i>

921
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,956
<i>Congratulations. You have passed.</i>

922
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,292
Damn straight.

923
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,594
You've reached Hong Keum-bo.

924
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:45,770
Is this the X-file?

925
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,897
The operation will last three months.

926
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,232
We're the only ones
who know about this in the office.

927
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,985
If things go awry,
I'll be shamed and forced to quit.

928
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,487
I'll have to kiss my pension goodbye.

929
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,197
I notified the office

930
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,990
that you'll be on a long-term
business trip in the countryside.

931
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,203
These are background check reports

932
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:05,289
on the three Yehppee candidates
and President Kang's close acquaintances.

933
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,001
Who's the new CEO of Hanmin?

934
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,295
Is it Oh Deok-gyu,
Chairman Kang's son-in-law?

935
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:14,131
I thought it'd be him too,
but apparently not.

936
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,132
It's an external hire.

937
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,344
- Who?
- I believe he's from overseas.

938
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,012
Oh, I almost forgot.

939
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,014
This is what you asked for.

940
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,312

RESIDENTIAL ADVISOR KIM NAM-JU

948
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,664
SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

949
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,834
Welcome to the Seoul City Dormitory
for Single Female Workers.

950
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,419
We're happy you're here.

951
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,005
You'll be required to pay
a deposit of 620,000 won

952
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,923
and a monthly rent of 24,000 won.

953
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,552
Eligibility is limited

954
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,804
to unmarried women under 29

955
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:49,059
who work in Seoul
and earn less than 15 million annually.

956
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,148
We will do our very best
to provide a safe living environment

957
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:58,194
until the day you're able to save up
and find a place of your own.

958
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,030
However!

959
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:07,119
All rules must be observed.

960
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,831
Curfew after midnight.

961
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,084
No visitors allowed
under any circumstances.

962
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,879
This is a women-only residence.

963
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:18,923
Don't ever forget that.

964
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,134
Applause.

965
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,693
Hello.

966
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:41,904
Room 301?

967
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,489
Me too.

968
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,075
- Hello.
- Hi.

969
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,494
It's you, the top exam scorer!

970
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,499
I'm Room 301 too.

971
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,501
It's you,

972
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:56,502
"Apple."

973
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,757
They said each room
would have four people.

974
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,467
Who are we missing?

975
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,302
I heard earlier

976
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,138
that everybody moved out
because of the queen bee here.

977
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,517
I heard she works
at the head office as an assistant.

978
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,356
Why do you even want to live in a dorm?

979
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,691
Must you take it that far?

980
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:23,529
The hidden link
between Yehppee and me lives there.

981
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,407
The three Yehppee candidates are

982
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:30,119
So Gyeong-dong,
Bang Jin-mok, and Cha Jung-il.

983
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:31,287
YEHPPEE CANDIDATES

984
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,746
President Kang

985
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,541
communicated with Yehppee,
the whistleblower, at the office.

986
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,128
He told me that his assistant
kept track of where he was

987
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,130
and whom he met with at all times.

988
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,968
So his assistant will have to know

989
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,012
who Yehppee is.

990
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:48,971
But

991
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,641
I'm sure she doesn't know
that she's an important witness.

992
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,979
GO BOK-HEE
PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT

993
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:58,772
LIVES IN ROOM 301
AT THE FEMALE WORKERS' DORM

994
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,067
Let's go inside.

995
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:08,115
Who's Hong Keum-bo?

996
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,952
<i>"Hong Jang-mi's Outfit Inspiration Book</i>
<i>for a 20-Year-Old."</i>

997
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,913
<i>From Hong Jang-mi.</i>
<i>To my sister, Hong Keum-bo.</i>

998
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,927
Why are you digging through my stuff?

999
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:30,346
Wait.

1000
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,390
I know that face.

1001
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:53,452
SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN YU-NA
AND PARK JUNG-PYO FOR THEIR APPEARANCES

1002
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:26,777
UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

1003
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,655
<i>Befriend that assistant</i>
<i>and just get the intel you need.</i>

1004
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,073
<i>Then focus on finding Yehppee.</i>

1005
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,116
<i>Hello.</i>

1006
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,409
I'm Hong Jang-mi.

1007
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,577
<i>Hey, Ms. Hong!</i>
<i>Commercial high! Uniform girl! You!</i>

1008
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,204
You'll deliver it safely and promptly.

1009
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,874
<i>I'm supposed to be</i>
<i>Ms. Go Bok-hee's successor?</i>

1010
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,084
You, lock the door.

1011
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,920
<i>Who says the new president</i>
<i>will have a new assistant?</i>

1012
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:48,215
<i>I'm the newest member</i>
<i>of Hanmin Investment & Securities,</i>

1013
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:49,133
<i>Shin Jung-woo.</i>

1014
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,218
<i>If I'd known</i>
<i>that Shin Jung-woo would be joining,</i>

1015
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:53,971
<i>I'd never have set foot in Hanmin,</i>
<i>undercover my ass.</i>

1016
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:55,431
<i>You know him?</i>

1017
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,891
<i>And shared a passionate romance?</i>

1018
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:04,523
