1
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,954
UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

2
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>The Witch of Yeouido is coming.</i>

3
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,793
<i>You have been promoted to team manager</i>
<i>at the Financial Supervisory Service,</i>

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,005
<i>and confirmed probe into the slush fund</i>
<i>of Hanmin Investment & Securities.</i>

5
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>The prosecution</i>
<i>and Financial Supervisory Service</i>

6
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>have already formed a task force team.</i>

7
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,885
HANMIN'S DECADE-LONG ALLEGATIONS

8
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,053
"Yehppee"?

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,555
<i>Yehppee and I</i>

10
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>are getting the ledger together</i>
<i>for whistleblowing purposes.</i>

11
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,060
<i>You can pick up the slush fund ledger</i>

12
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,521
<i>at the president's office</i>
<i>on the 12th floor in Hanmin's head office.</i>

13
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,274
You could end up receiving
a prison sentence.

14
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,109
Yes. I'm prepared for as much.

15
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,945
- Is it not there?
- This can't be.

16
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Maybe someone at Hanmin</i>

17
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,867
<i>found out about you and President Kang?</i>

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>This is undoubtedly a warning.</i>

19
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,787
Keum-bo!

20
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,747
Go undercover as some entry-level minion?

21
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,957
<i>They wouldn't imagine you doing this</i>
<i>in their wildest dreams.</i>

22
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,958
<i>All right, sorry.</i>

23
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,002
I mean, you're 35.

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,213
<i>Who would ever think</i>
<i>you're in your twenties?</i>

25
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,007
<i>I'll proceed</i>
<i>with the Hanmin undercover investigation.</i>

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,343
<i>I'll find Yehppee within three months</i>

27
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>and retrieve the slush fund ledger.</i>

28
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,431
Let's hurry up.
The president is waiting for us.

29
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,725
It's not like he's waiting out
in the hot sun.

30
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,060
<i>The three Yehppee candidates are</i>

31
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,188
<i>So Gyeong-dong,</i>
<i>Bang Jin-mok, and Cha Jung-il.</i>

32
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>His assistant will have to know</i>

33
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,900
<i>who Yehppee is.</i>

34
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,486
<i>Befriend that assistant</i>
<i>and just get the intel you need.</i>

35
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,779
<i>Then focus on finding Yehppee.</i>

36
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,739
What's with the loitering?

37
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,866
<i>Please welcome President Shin Jung-woo.</i>

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,243
<i>Hello.</i>

39
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,286
I'm Shin Jung-woo.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,248
Ms. Hong, you've been appointed
as President Shin's new assistant.

41
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>Who says the new president</i>
<i>will have a new assistant?</i>

42
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>Who would you say the late President Kang</i>
<i>was closest to at the company?</i>

43
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,424
<i>If there was a general manager</i>
<i>he was close to, they might help you out.</i>

44
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,219
<i>Come on. Who would help out</i>
<i>an assistant with no boss?</i>

45
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,513
<i>I could come with you.</i>

46
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,639
We're roommates.

47
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,015
<i>How about this?</i>

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>You swoop in and show President Shin</i>
<i>how capable an assistant you are.</i>

49
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,275
<i>Not a single person here</i>
<i>can answer my question?</i>

50
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>These are anticipated Q&As</i>
<i>for the chairman.</i>

51
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>Must read!</i>

52
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,904
I hope this works out.

53
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,615
That means I can continue working

54
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>- as your assistant, right?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

55
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,410
Thanks.

56
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,996
<i>I spent all night racking my brain,</i>
<i>wondering if I should visit Mr. So</i>

57
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,372
<i>with a box of expensive ribs.</i>

58
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,666
You mean Mr. So Gyeong-dong
in the Trading Division?

59
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,168
<i>President Kang's mentor</i>

60
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,878
<i>and a well-respected,</i>
<i>seasoned veteran in Hanmin.</i>

61
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,212
He's got to be Yehppee.

62
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,589
<i>There's something fishy.</i>

63
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,008
<i>How can you trust her?</i>

64
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,509
You mean Go Bok-hee?

65
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,057
Damn it.

66
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,149
Why does he work in the dark?

67
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,610
My poor heart.

68
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,758
Keum-bo.

69
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,510
Hong Keum-bo.

70
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,145
Have we met, mister?

71
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,691
May I ask you what your name is?

72
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,193
What do you want my name for?

73
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,696
You can't have my beeper number.

74
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,947
I have a boyfriend.

75
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,035
Wait, I…

76
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,559
Ta-da.

77
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,606
Hong Keum-bo, Shin Jung-woo.

78
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,152
Here.

79
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,737
That's yours,

80
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,405
and this is mine.

81
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,241
Every time you're struggling
with a hard decision,

82
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,493
I'll be by your side.

83
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,456
And every time you have
an important decision to make,

84
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,166
I'll be waiting with you.

85
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,173
- Keum-bo.
- Yeah?

86
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,302
We should tell our seniors and colleagues

87
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,012
about our relationship, right?

88
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,681
We should keep it a secret.

89
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,183
I'll deny it all.

90
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,142
I'm not sure

91
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,977
I have much faith in your poker face.

92
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,563
I'm confident

93
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,065
that I won't get caught.

94
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,066
Really?

95
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,067
Most definitely.

96
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,675
Hello, sir. It's Shin Jung-woo.

97
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,718
It's been a while.

98
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,929
I was just wondering…

99
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,142
if you knew
what Hong Keum-bo has been up to.

100
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,448
I'm back.

101
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,952
Jang-mi, you look extra tired today.

102
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,579
I ran a bit. It's been a while.

103
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,876
Being young must be so nice.

104
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,088
Now that everyone's home,
how about a late-night snack?

105
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,507
How does rotisserie chicken sound?
It'll be my treat.

106
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,425
Yes!

107
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,636
But it's almost midnight.
We can't order any deliveries.

108
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,388
Oh, right.

109
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,308
The RA made that very clear
at the orientation.

110
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,144
It does sound really tasty though.

111
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,273
Hello, sir.

112
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm calling from the women's dorm,
Room 301.

113
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,277
Can we get two rotisserie chickens?

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,403
Two bottles of beer too.

115
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,198
Thank you. See you there.

116
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,620
Do you know what sets
humans apart from animals?

117
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,249
It's that we humans use tools.

118
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,600
- Jang-mi.
- Why me?

119
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,227
Do you expect me to do it then?

120
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,020
This is clearly a job for the youngest.

121
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,474
Jang-mi.

122
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,935
Heave-ho.

123
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,480
- Heave-ho.
- Heave-ho.

124
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,690
Stop it.

125
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,277
- Heave-ho.
- Heave-ho.

126
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,031
Heave-ho.

127
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,408
Keep going.

128
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,292
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

129
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,218
Eat up.

130
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,803
JEOM'S ROTISSERIE CHICKEN

131
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,518
CREDIBILITY

132
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,436
SUSPICIOUS

133
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,520
This is so good.

134
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,155
Here. Take it.

135
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,748
I'm not a kid.
What am I supposed to do with this?

136
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,551
Hong Jang-mi.

137
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,013
As of today, you're officially recognized
as a resident of Room 301.

138
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,222
"As of today"?

139
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,933
I've lived here for three days already.

140
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,938
Come on, I let you have the pink one.

141
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,900
Thanks.

142
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,204
Who is she to recognize me or whatever?

143
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,242
What's your deal?
Don't dig through my stuff!

144
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,868
Wait, I'm not…

145
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,621
- No, hold on.
- Let go, you thief!

146
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,039
What? Thief?

147
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,000
- Bok-hee.
- Are you okay?

148
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,960
Hey!

149
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,629
<i>You thief!</i>

150
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,090
Who's that at this hour?

151
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,689
Bok-hee.

152
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,232
If she were looking to steal,

153
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,776
she would've gone for your wallet,
not your notebook.

154
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,239
Maybe she already did.

155
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,949
You two, search her pockets.

156
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,994
Go on and search them. Search away.

157
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,456
It's your RA. Open the door.

158
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,335
Put it away.

159
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,396
I heard you shout earlier, Ms. Go.

160
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,316
Are you experiencing issues
with your roommates again?

161
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,276
You are one demerit point away
from eviction.

162
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,780
We're all great friends here.

163
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,074
Maybe the TV was too loud?

164
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,285
We were watching a comedy show.

165
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,411
Right.

166
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,747
We're really into this series, you see.

167
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,332
It's past midnight.

168
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,042
In fact, it's color bars time.

169
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,798
<i>This is the only way.</i>

170
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,138
Bok-hee's bag fell over,

171
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,098
so I was just trying to be nice

172
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,392
and pick up what fell out of it.

173
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,563
That's when she came in
and treated me like some thief.

174
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,523
No, I didn't.

175
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,735
I've always been an honest,
tax-paying citizen.

176
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,739
Taxes? You haven't even received
your first paycheck yet.

177
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,784
Ms. Kim, she's lying through her teeth.

178
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,786
She's a bad seed!

179
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,413
That's enough.

180
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,666
Ms. Go, bring me your bag.

181
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,750
Pardon?

182
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,968
Do you see anything missing?

183
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,470
No.

184
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,019
Any missing money?

185
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355
It is all there, but…

186
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,526
What about this?

187
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,154
It's a notebook from work,
but I use it as my diary.

188
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,284
With no financial loss
or missing property,

189
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,035
it'd be difficult to call this theft.

190
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,788
It seems there's been
a little misunderstanding.

191
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,082
Let's just settle this amicably.

192
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,141
EPISODE 3: RIGHT UNDER THE NOSE
AND IN THE LINE OF FIRE

193
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,228
<i>Chuseok, the nation's biggest holiday,</i>
<i>is fast approaching.</i>

194
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,522
<i>With a four-day holiday this year,</i>

195
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,816
<i>train stations and bus terminals</i>
<i>across the country</i>

196
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,486
<i>are bustling with people heading home</i>
<i>to spend time with their families.</i>

197
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,906
<i>Let's find out more</i>
<i>about the holiday traffic.</i>

198
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,785
<i>The nation's 20 million people</i>
<i>are once again on the move for Chuseok.</i>

199
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,164
<i>The highways have come</i>
<i>to resemble massive parking lots</i>

200
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>with the gridlocks caused</i>
<i>by the influx of homebound traffic.</i>

201
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,837
<i>The lengthy delays for the past two days</i>
<i>had travelers face six-hour travel time…</i>

202
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,131
JANG-MI'S SMILE (REPEAT)

203
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,341
"Jang-mi"?

204
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,218
Screw that.

205
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,054
<i>Daejeon saw its highways</i>

206
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,890
<i>at a virtual standstill</i>
<i>with the convergence of holiday traffic…</i>

207
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,601
Gather around, Room 301.

208
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,564
Happy Chuseok!

209
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,068
We should celebrate the holiday too.

210
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,280
Living under the same roof
and sharing meals makes us family.

211
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,583
This is so good.

212
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,086
Try that too.

213
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,342
Look at this big chunk.

214
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,228
Seriously?

215
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,606
Did you really show up empty-handed

216
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,358
to a table set by your seniors
and expect to feast?

217
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,068
But you didn't cook anything, either.

218
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,119
The braised short ribs
are really good, Mi-sook.

219
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,108
Hey, turn that computer off.

220
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,027
I can't sleep because of you!

221
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,779
<i>Are you sure it's not</i>
<i>the guilt keeping you awake?</i>

222
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,493
Did you already forget

223
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,953
that I helped you keep your job?

224
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,997
Hey!

225
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,970
One of us will end up moving out.

226
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:35,888
And for your information,

227
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,930
I'm not moving out.

228
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,933
I could say just the same.

229
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,230
Oh my gosh.

230
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,399
I guess she got kicked out.

231
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,862
Do you want to sleep in our room?

232
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,990
I didn't get kicked out.

233
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm fine.

234
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,499
Please make me rich.

235
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,626
I want to get married.

236
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,634
Please let me find Yehppee quickly
so I can return home.

237
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:14,968
I beg you.

238
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,105
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

239
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,107
WISHING ALL OF THE HANMIN FAMILY
A BOUNTIFUL CHUSEOK

240
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,070
HANMIN REWARDS WITH FULLY RIPENED RETURNS!

241
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,197
Come on now.

242
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,282
Why not? Spicier is better.

243
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,499
Ms. Hong, is the cafe open today?

244
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:50,838
It's so bitter.

245
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,090
Never heard of two, two, two,
the golden ratio?

246
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,175
Half your job is making coffee.

247
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,179
You really should go back to Admin

248
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,014
and relearn the basics.

249
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,476
Come here for a second.

250
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,729
You know Ms. Go in Admin?

251
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,982
The spinster who's almost 30.

252
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,400
There's a new president in town,

253
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,485
so how do you think
she managed to survive?

254
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,949
Life must be so easy for women.

255
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,035
But don't honey traps
and brute force feel a bit outdated?

256
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,453
Times have changed. Right?

257
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,624
General Manager Cha Jung-il.

258
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,877
What? Are you curious too?

259
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,670
You are, aren't you?

260
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,297
Shut that mouth of yours.

261
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,341
Times <i>have</i> changed.

262
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,968
What?

263
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,763
You should stop spreading nasty rumors
and act your age now.

264
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,140
Hey!

265
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,559
Did you hear about Ms. Hong
from Risk Management?

266
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,519
I heard Cha from Research
has it out for her.

267
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,062
Yeah.

268
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,356
But I heard he was the one who started it,

269
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,692
talking about how the new president
is keeping Go Bok-hee around

270
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,985
because she set a honey trap.

271
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,820
Yeah, and after he did,

272
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,655
Ms. Hong told him to shut up.

273
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,326
Still, assigning her that translation task
meant for foreign-trained staff

274
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,744
is taking it too far.

275
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,747
There's no way a high school grad
could finish that by tomorrow morning.

276
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,498
I know, right?

277
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,937
I heard Cha has it out for you again.

278
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,563
Yes, well…

279
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,106
I'm sure you'll do obnoxiously well, but…

280
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,651
You can speak a bit of English, can't you?

281
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:39,988
Just a bit.

282
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,033
I think it'll be faster if I do it myself.

283
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,869
Jeez.

284
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,711
Why wait? I told you to go on ahead.

285
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,629
GLOBAL STOCK MARKET REPORT,
TRANSLATED COPY

286
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,838
You couldn't help anyway.

287
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,298
I cheered you on in my heart.

288
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,550
Let's go.

289
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,261
Wait.

290
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,320
LAXATIVE

291
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,496
NORA'S LAXATIVES
CHA'S VITAMINS

292
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,668
Don't you think that's a bit childish?

293
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,461
Revenge is meant to be petty.

294
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,879
That's the way to piss them off.

295
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,756
Jang-mi.

296
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,591
You're not going to join in?

297
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,176
Well…

298
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,312
RECEIPTS FOR EXPENSE REPORTS

299
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,694
Are you constipated?

300
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,159
Good morning.

301
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,536
- Hello, sir.
- Let's have another good day.

302
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,996
Hello, sir.

303
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,590
GLOBAL STOCK MARKET REPORT,
TRANSLATED COPY

304
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,142
To the future. To the world.

305
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,062
Hanmin.

306
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,565
MULTIVITAMINS

307
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,698
This is my first team meeting
since I was hired.

308
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,533
It's our first one as well.

309
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,327
This is Risk Management's
first-ever meeting.

310
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,288
But still, I see you managed
to prepare all this.

311
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,206
That wasn't me.

312
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,540
It was me.

313
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,544
Come on, it's the female employee's job

314
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,756
to put out the drinks
and snacks for the meeting.

315
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,258
Noted.

316
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,932
<i>I need to get this over with</i>
<i>and find Yehppee.</i>

317
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,523
Now, we'll start the meeting

318
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,484
on Hanmin's information-sharing
system development.

319
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,236
Let us begin.

320
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,119
We're not alone in pursuing
an internal information-sharing system.

321
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,831
Since last year, many companies
have begun implementing such systems.

322
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,499
These internal workspaces

323
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,210
for communication and collaboration
are collectively referred to as

324
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,628
the intranet system.

325
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,756
The Risk Management Division?

326
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,091
They can't get anything done.

327
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,717
They have no brainpower

328
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,052
or manpower.

329
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,345
We need to outsource.

330
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,304
They…

331
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,182
First, we must develop a system
that can be easily used by all,

332
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,101
even without a manual.

333
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,562
If you look at the second factor,

334
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,064
- we need a system based on rank…
- Are they actually working?

335
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,623
I will do my best to build
an information-sharing system

336
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,334
that faithfully implements
all the elements I've discussed today.

337
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,503
Thank you.

338
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,925
But the most important part,
the development timeline, is missing.

339
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,261
No need to rush it. We'll just…

340
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,512
Three days.

341
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,099
Come on now. Is that even possible?

342
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,269
Possibility isn't a factor. We must do it.

343
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,109
It's a directive from the president.

344
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,571
And Mr. Lee is very talented.

345
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,800
Ms. Hong, you don't know
what you're talking about.

346
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,346
Even industry professionals
couldn't complete it in three days.

347
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,597
I will make it happen!

348
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,982
Good luck! You got this!

349
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,526
I knew it.

350
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,444
Let's go!

351
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,489
Great. Good luck.

352
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,492
INFORMATION-SHARING SYSTEM
DEVELOPMENT DAY 1

353
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,375
You're so much faster than I expected.

354
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,168
Thanks.

355
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,338
But you made a coding error.

356
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,258
Here.

357
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,637
Sorry. That was a typing error.

358
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,554
Mr. Lee.

359
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,974
You're doing great.

360
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,191
She's a pro
at the carrot-and-stick approach.

361
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,944
I can't tell who's the manager
and who's the new hire anymore.

362
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,947
Ms. Hong, do you even know
what you're talking about?

363
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,865
<i>This is the moment</i>

364
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,784
<i>I use my secret weapon.</i>

365
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,786
Oh my.

366
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,955
My hair is just so in the way.

367
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,220
I missed it.

368
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,973
It's so far back.
You're going to rewind it that much?

369
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,517

DEVELOPMENT DAY 2

370
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,187
Lunch time.

371
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,398
How about spicy pork stir-fry?

372
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,734
Mr. Lee, let's resume after…

373
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,321
Did you not go home last night?
Could your hair be any greasier?

374
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,282
No. This is my 29th hour in the office.

375
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,951
Mr. Lee, you need to eat.
Let's go get some lunch.

376
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,788
I have Mr. Lee's lunch right here.

377
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,214
She's going to bring him
a chamber pot at this rate.

378
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,800
Do you need one?

379
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,511
I'm okay for now.

380
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,348
Eat up.

381
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,391
Let's go, Big Al.

382
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,144
- What should we eat?
- Spicy pork stir-fry!

383

HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

386
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,556
It's done!

387
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,269
Is it all done?

388
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:12,899
Team dinner time.

389
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,359
We did it!

390
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,070
No, <i>we </i>didn't do it.

391
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,489
Manager Lee Yong-gi did it.

392
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,034
You gave us
the most excellent performance.

393
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,911
Well done.

394
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,663
I'm so proud of you!

395
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,124
Thank you.

396
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,585
It was only possible
because of you, Ms. Hong.

397
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,003
Thank you.

398
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,385
Thank you.

399
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,053
Thank you.

INTRANET PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

401
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,277
PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO

402
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,862
You finished sooner than I expected.

403
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,532
I'm sure you're already aware,
but I didn't build it.

404
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,951
Ms. Hong Jang-mi and Manager Lee Yong-gi

405
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,120
gave it everything they had
to make it into a reality.

406
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,122
Hong Jang-mi and Lee Yong-gi…

407
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,837
It's a leader's job to enable employees
to stay focused on their work.

408
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:20,258
Chairman Kang asked me
to provide you with guidance

409
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,219
to ensure that you develop
into a leader befitting Hanmin.

410
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:24,971
Me?

411
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,640
Why?

412
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:34,272
So you'll basically be taking on
the role of Mr. So.

413
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,735
He started tutoring my uncle
on the stock market

414
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,570
when my uncle was a college student.

415
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,573
After my uncle joined the company,
he served as…

416
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,784
a loyal aide.

417
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,368
A "loyal aide"?

418
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,912
Yes.

419
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,210
But you know

420
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,338
that our chairman
also has a daughter, right?

421
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,801
Feel free to play both sides.

422
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,355
INTRANET SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT

423
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,815
ALL INTERNAL MATERIALS WILL BE SHARED
VIA THE "INTRANET."

424
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,318
INTRANET SYSTEM
PLEASE LOG IN TO ACCESS

425
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,949
They're only making life difficult
with this nonsense.

426
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,617
This would only be a challenge
for the general managers.

427
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,743
Youngsters learn fast.

428
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,037
I'm young.

429
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,831
I'm in my prime.

430
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,543
The intranet makes it so much easier.

431
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,295
We're making
half the copies and deliveries.

432
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,674
I know, right?
I heard they worked three nights straight.

433
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,633
Seriously?

434
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,643
Didn't you say you'd eat your hat
if Jang-mi got it done?

435
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,271
When did I say that?

436
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,481
And it's not like
Hong Jang-mi did it herself.

437
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,026
The intranet.

438
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,238
That's right. Albert, my son, made it.

439
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,073
It makes life easier. It's nice.

440
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,368
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

441
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,882
That's not like you at all.

442
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,848
We were hearing feedback
on the new intranet system.

443
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,435
Everyone gave five stars.
They are all very satisfied with it.

444
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,436
Is that so?

445
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,772
President Shin, what are your thoughts?

446
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,858
It has an intuitive design
that maximizes usability.

447
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,028
Division Manager Oh
graciously credited his team.

448
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,237
Really?

449
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,156
Our Albert is

450
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,950
just so humble, isn't he, sir?

451
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:55,038
I told him to take it easy,
but he does his name proud.

452
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,331
"Noble and bright."

453
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,541
He nobly thinks about
the company's bright future.

454
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,129
All right, everyone.

455
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,006
Our job is done for the year.

456
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,216
Don't do any work until next year.
That's all!

457
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,093
Yeah! No more work!

<i>Maybe Yehppee is the name of his dog?</i>

464
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:53,930
Let's see…

465
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,113
Oh my, I'm so honored.

466
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,155
Mr. Lee.

467
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,701
Do you happen to know
the name of Mr. So's dog?

468
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,785
So pretty…

469
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,662
I mean, Yehppee.

470
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,706
Yehppee?

471
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,416
Are you sure it's Yehppee?

472
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,586
Of course. I heard about it
while drinking with So-Bang-Cha.

473
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,422
"So-Bang-Cha"?

474
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,438
<i>Why don't you</i>

475
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,439
<i>Know</i>

476
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,773
<i>How I feel about you?</i>

477
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,945
<i>They all differ in age,</i>
<i>year of hire, and rank, but they're close.</i>

478
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,655
<i>That's why they got that nickname.</i>

479
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,909
You could even call them
the living witnesses

480
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,202
to every rise and fall of Hanmin.

481
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,165
I heard the late president

482
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,918
really trusted
all three members of So-Bang-Cha.

483
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,046
That's right. It seemed like that.

484
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,090
Who did he trust the most?

485
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,343
Jeong Won-gwan.

486
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,637
I mean, Mr. So.

487
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,307
I see.

488
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,270
Hello, sir.

489
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,190
- Hello there.
- He's our new hire.

490
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,608
<i>So Gyeong-dong.</i>

491
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,110
<i>The legendary trader of Yeouido.</i>

492
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,322
<i>In the securities market,</i>
<i>where returns are a measure of character,</i>

493
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:38,201
<i>he's admired not only for his talent</i>
<i>but also for his integrity.</i>

494
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,455
<i>He's a Hanmin man to the core,</i>
<i>turning down any and every job offer</i>

495
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,123
<i>that came his way all these years.</i>

496
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,377
- They hired a lot this year.
- Yeah.

497
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,130
What would you like?

498
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,674
- Kimchi pork stir-fry for me.
- Kimchi pork stir-fry?

499
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,555
Yes, understood.

500
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,603
Hello, this is from Mr. Cha.

501
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,521
Thank you.

502
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,356
- Hurry.
- A copy?

503
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,273
Yes, hurry.

504
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,650
And Ms. Kang, bring more coffee.

505
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,361
- Yes, sir.
- Get me a refill.

506
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:15,988
Sorry.

507
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,199
My apologies.

508
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,367
Get it together.

509
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,542
- What would you like?
- I already told you the second one.

510
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,502
Quickly.

511
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,303
Oh no.

512
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,264
Please don't fall.

513
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,311
Darn it.

514
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,526
Thank you so much.

515
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,489
We should help each other out, Eun-joo.

516
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,457
It's just so hard.

517
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,376
Since I'm the youngest,

518
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,837
I have to grab lunch
for all 20 traders by myself.

519
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,799
They yell at me
for getting their orders wrong,

520
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,384
for being so slow,

521
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,553
and for delivery mistakes.

522
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,557
But you know what's even more annoying?

523
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,101
Even after stomaching all that criticism,

524
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,687
I'm still hungry for food.

525
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,691
Eat up, Eun-joo.

526
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,945
It's so tasty.

527
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,034
By the way, how is Mr. So Gyeong-dong?

528
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:44,869
My boss?

529
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,705
He doesn't eat lunch.

530
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,832
Apparently, he's been like that
for 20 years.

531
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,000
Nine to six.

532
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,545
He only ever leaves his desk
to go to the bathroom.

533
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,675
But still, he never yells at me.

534
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,848
Starting tomorrow, how about I help you

535
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,767
since my team isn't busy at all?

536
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,398
Let me wipe that for you.

RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

538
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,420
Good morning.

539
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,548
What's that?

540
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:40,967
Is it a gift?

541
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,261
- For Ms. Hong?
- Yes.

542
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,221
To thank her for her guidance and support.

543
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,432
I bought some handmade cookies
that would go perfectly with coffee.

544
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,725
What about for us?

545
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,853
Neither of you contributed anything.

546
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,939
I also know
how to nitpick and micromanage,

547
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,565
but I held back.

548
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,817
Hold on.

549
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,405
What's with the sudden perm
and highlights?

550
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,198
Highlights?

551
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,325
You got highlights?

552
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,912
I'm going to need to have
a conversation with Ms. Hong.

553
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,122
- About what?
- Why?

554
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,457
About how office romances ruin lives.

555
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,584
- That's not what this is.
- It clearly is.

556
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,003
- That's a misunderstanding.
- I don't think so.

557
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,255
No, you can't… Darn it.

558
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,843
Hold on. Where's Ms. Hong anyway?

559
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,344
Did she call out?

560
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,181
You're not supposed to touch this.
Damn it.

561
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,726
What would you like for lunch?

562
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,311
Would you like Kimchi pork stir-fry again?

563
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,353
Yeah, let's go with that.

564
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,528
Now, shall we get started
on another exciting day?

565
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,658
Let's once again survive today.

566
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,577
Let's survive as long as we can.

567
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,287

568
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,122

- To the World! To the Future!

569
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,248
- Hanmin!
- Hanmin.

570
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,059
Would you like to place your lunch order?

571
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,101
Just the usual for me.

572
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:16,979

Big Al, let's grab

576
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,446
That sounds great,

577
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,116
- but I have plans.
- With who?

578
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,744
With the chairman, my dad,
and Mr. So from Trading.

579
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,662
Really?

580
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,373
Ms. Hong, join us for lunch.

581
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,584
I have to help Trading
with the lunch deliveries.

582
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,629
Enjoy your lunch.

583
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,840
You'll look even more haggard
if you skip meals.

584
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:26,757
Let's go eat lunch.

585
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,426
I'll see you later.

Ms. Kang, no cucumbers in mine, right?

592
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,668

- Are there cucumbers?

621
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,097
There's no way she was smart enough
to prevent an order-entry blunder.

622
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,140
She's just a new hire,

623
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,933
a minion,

624
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,351
a high-school grad.

625
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,728
What does she know?

626
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,397
So who's the trader
behind the three-billion-won screw-up?

627
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,523
Who knows?

628
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:33,193
That idiot can forget about
ever working in Yeouido again.

629
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,280
But that Ms. Hong…

630
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,533
I feel like I've seen her
somewhere before.

631
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,285
The interview, remember?

632
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,121
She's the cheeky one who raised her hand
because we didn't ask her anything.

633
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,291
She was the one who pointed out
the exam question error?

634
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,920
That little one

635
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,506
likes to nitpick as if it were a hobby.

636
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,843
I'm actually worried about Mr. So.

637
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,555
This is complete nonsense!

638
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,018
He claims he made the order-entry error

639
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,062
due to a keyboard malfunction.

640
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,190
It didn't seem intentional…

641
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,192
Unbelievable.

642
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,737
Are you trying to cover
for your subordinate right now?

643
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,782
I guess one more slip
and the whole company will go under.

644
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,912
We're discussing executed trades
with the relevant brokerages.

645
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,707
But still, the error was detected,
and the order was canceled immediately.

646
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,834
We requested the Korea Exchange
to cancel the order,

647
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,586
which helped prevent additional losses.

648
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,092
I heard some lowly female employee
was the one who canceled it.

649
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,344
Who cares about that right now?

650
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,181
I was just worried about her going around,
spreading her "heroic" tale

651
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,849
and damaging the company's image.

652
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,102
I'm just concerned, that's all.

653
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,978
More importantly,

654
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:54,024
I've received a tip
that this incident has the FSS considering

655
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,317
an investigation into us.

656
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,569
What? Goddamnit!

657
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,910
Is it true that a female employee
from Trading canceled the order?

658
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,036
No.

659
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,081
It's the new hire in Risk Management.

660
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:12,501
Do you mean Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

661
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,219
- Hey, you!
- Jeez.

662
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,267
Thanks to you,
I've had the worst indigestion recently.

663
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,769
Listen, blending in is barely enough
to get you by right now.

664
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,397
How can you go and attract
even more attention?

665
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,900
Who cares if Hanmin makes an order error
and loses three billion won?

666
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,193
That's none of your business.

667
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,238
Look, my hand reacted
before I could think.

668
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,699
You're so painfully predictable.

669
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:47,828
I have to carry around antacids
because of you.

670
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,582
Wait, how did you find out?

671
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,833
Who told you?

672
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,626
"Three billion won"?
That's quite detailed.

673
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,880

674
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,467

a retail investor from Myeongdong,

708
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:54,473
while others say
they're a retired politician or a hacker.

709
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,016
The rumor mill churns them out.

710
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,229
But you know,
based on the caliber of their intel,

711
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,982
they're clearly
a hotshot in this industry.

712
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,735
The Captain of the Yeouido Pirates?

713
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,403
I've never heard of them.

714
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,407
Wait, how do you know about this
when I just heard about it?

715
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,371
Do you think I got this far
just on my card-playing skills?

716
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,748
You always push your luck
and suffer alone in the end.

717
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,293
I received my invite and joined ages ago.

718
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,336
The Yeouido Pirates, that is.

719
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,550
I still manage to maintain
good relationships with people,

720
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,219
unlike you.

721
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,013
Right.

722
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,517
So I have neither friends nor colleagues.

723
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,018
That's what you're saying, right?

724
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,439
I didn't need this gossip rag
to be good at my job.

725
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,943
Besides, we shouldn't be letting
such baseless rumors dictate our actions.

726
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,697
Still, I guess we should check it out.

727
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,907
Send me an invite.

728
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,369
- I can't.
- Why not?

729
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,287
You get one invite per account.

730
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,373
Then you can just invite me.

731
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,502
I've already sent mine to Nam Dong-gi.

732
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,796
You chose that jerk over me?

733
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,633
Why did it have to be
Nam Dong-gi, of all people?

734
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,676
Damn weasel.

735
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,802
My stomach is upset again.

736
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,059
Jang-mi.

737
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,645
Long day at work?

738
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,732
Mi-sook, have you heard of
the Yeouido Pirates?

739
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,401
Yes. I signed up recently.

740
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,487
Then can you send me an invite?
Recommend me.

741
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,199
Oh, I already used mine
on my branch section chief today.

742
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:37,951
I see.

743
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:45,250
I heard that Queen Bee
hasn't used her invite yet.

744
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,711
Let me give you some advice.

745
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,507
…and just bring her that.

I'm back.

752
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,418
What's that in your hand? Cake?

753
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,921
That looks so tasty.

754
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,756
Bok-hee, you like cake too, don't you?

755
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,592
It's too late for cake.

756
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,594
I started my diet yesterday.

757
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,264
Do you know
how many calories are in a cake?

758
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,646
Bok-hee.

759
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,898
Is there any chance you'd invite me
to the Yeouido Pirates?

760
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,942
I already used up my invite.

761
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,408
Let me get this straight.

762
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,828
You all did it for one another

763
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,955
and just left me out?

764
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,381
Enjoy the cake.

765
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,603
Oh no. I already used mine up.

766
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:29,980
What about you, Mr. Bang?

767
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,357
I invited him.

768
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,984
Big Al, let's go to lunch.

769
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,402
To Auntie's?

770
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:36,903
Let's go to Auntie's, Mr. Lee.

771
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,405
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go eat their soup.

772
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,614
That sounds great.

773
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,325
Time for lunch.

774
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,911
Why didn't you ask me?

775
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,582
- Pardon?
- For an invite to the Yeouido Pirates.

776
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,166
I can do that for you.

777
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,006
Really?

778
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,679
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

779
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,186
Go on then.

780
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,022
Sure.

781
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,985
To start, what's your
PC Communication username?

782
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,194
My PC Communication username?

783
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,572
Do you not have one?

784
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,198
Okay then.

785
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,075
Give me your resident registration number.

786
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:24,993
Six…

787
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,288
Ms. Hong?

788
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:29,956
What's the number?

789
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,876
Well…

790
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,879
I'll tell you
after you get back from lunch.

791
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:36,796
No, I'm fine.

792
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,008
Gosh, I shouldn't have
asked you during lunchtime.

793
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,885
You're going to Auntie's, right?

794
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,053
I'm really fine.

795
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,055
- You must be starving. Go and eat.
- Wait…

796
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,348
I'm not hungry anymore.

797
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,307
Go on.

821
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,506
I will not respond to them.

822
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,343
I will let Admin and the PR Division
know about the request immediately.

823
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:52,223
The Financial Supervisory Service
will be here for an investigation today.

824
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,310
It's just a formality,
but they could speak to you.

825
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,145
So be prepared.

826
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,273
The Financial Supervisory Service?

827
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,695
Who knew we'd be inspecting
Hanmin's internal oversight?

828
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,617
If Hong Keum-bo were around,
she would've insisted on being here.

829
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,243
Just imagine.

830
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,287
- Hey.
- Yes?

831
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,749
We're here to perform our official duties.

00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,425
a female employee I didn't recognize
suddenly jumped in.

836
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,513
She misunderstood the situation
and caused this mess.

837
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,764
So you're saying

838
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,100
that you made a simple mistake?

839
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,310
I feel wronged.

840
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,397
Why would I ever do anything like that
and throw away my whole career?

841
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,693
Shouldn't we first speak to
Ms. Hong Jang-mi and hear her out?

842
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,822
Shut it.

843
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,576
We believe he made an honest mistake.

844
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,914
It was a devastating mistake
that could've tarnished

845
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,667
the sterling reputation
of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

846
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,544
Excuse me.

847
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,713
Could you get us Ms. Hong Jang-mi--

848
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,389
Someone could be lying.

849
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,598
Just shut up already.

850
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,350
Right? President Shin?

851
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,396
Ms. Go.

852
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,816
Please summon Ms. Hong Jang-mi
from the Risk Management Division.

853
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,277
Yes, sir. I'll see to it immediately.

854
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,090
You've reached Risk Management.

855
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,092
Hong Jang-mi,
the president is asking for you.

856
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,343
<i>You'd better run up here.</i>

857
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:54,929
Right now?

858
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,445
Why do you look like that?

859
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,491
I'm just a bit nervous.

860
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,015
Where's everyone?

861
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,059
That's why I told you to hurry.

862
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,436
It was a complete mess.

863
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,272
Please summon Ms. Hong Jang-mi
from the Risk Management Division.

864
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,775
Yes, sir. I'll see to it immediately.

- What's wrong?
- Are you okay, sir?

868
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,343
Sir?

869
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,763
Sir, are you all right? What's wrong?

870
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,226
- Call for an ambulance now! Hurry!
- Okay.

871
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,103
Sir, are you all right?

872
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,690
What's wrong, sir?

873
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,150
Sir?

874
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,448
That hurts, you punk.

875
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,493
He's hurting! He's in pain!

876
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,120
Sir.

877
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,038
Hold on a second.

878
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:48,960
Keep hitting him.

879
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,754

Hey.

01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,062
You pay for this today.

01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,316
You're really okay, right?

886
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,028
There are plenty of fake patients here
who are worse off than me.

887
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,030
Besides, you're in no place
to worry about me.

888
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,407
You just worry about yourself, okay?

889
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,909
Hanmin Investment & Securities

890
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,245
has decided to conclude this by firing

891
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,081
Hong Jang-mi, the entry-level minion
with a high school diploma.

892
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,750
You're their scapegoat.

893
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,877
You'd better prepare for your return.

894
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,963
Why would I be kicked out?
I refuse to leave.

895
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,884
Can you look into the accounts
of Assistant Manager Jung in Trading?

896
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,345
I'm sure he received
a retainer fee beforehand.

897
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,056
We'll carry out
an internal probe of our own.

898
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,895
Our higher-ups

899
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,482
have already been swept off their feet.

900
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,108
What?

901
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:02,200
<i>One day, we'll be together</i>

902
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:07,580
<i>Even if we're apart now</i>

903
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:13,419
<i>My very existence depends on yours</i>

904
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:20,510
<i>I'm only alive because you exist</i>

905
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,976
The Korean stock market
is only open from nine to three.

906
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,728
So why the hell
does it get busier and nastier

907
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,271
after the sun goes down?

908
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,444
That's Chairman Kang's specialty.

909
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,655
Cash handouts under the table.

910
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,621
Don't tell me you're jealous.

911
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,207
- Yeah.
- What?

912
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,918
No, it's nothing.

913
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,840
His son-in-law is a former official
at the Ministry of Finance and Economy

914
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,883
and my immediate senior
in the civil service.

915
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,845
Jeez.

916
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,013
Money follows connections.

917
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,016
And I have no connections whatsoever.

918
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,186
You don't need to take it that far.

919
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:14,731
However!

920
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,026
Even today,
I invested in you, Hong Keum-bo!

921
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:19,944
A long-term investment!

922
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,072
So don't forget that
and keep digging until the end.

923
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,950
I'll extend your leave as much as I can.

924
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,842
Slow down.

925
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,346
That's too hot.

926
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,015
DISCIPLINARY HEARING NOTICE

927
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,767
HONG JANG-MI, RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

928
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,560
GROUNDS: HANYE ELECTRONICS ORDER ERROR

929
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,943
What's a disciplinary hearing?

930
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:09,076
It's putting a bad employee on stage
to punish them for their wrongdoing.

931
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,623
And what exactly did I do wrong?

932
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,720
We're planning to dismiss Ms. Hong,
the one who reported the incident

933
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:28,971
to the Korea Exchange.

934
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,766
She didn't do anything wrong.

935
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,601
It sounds like she'll be terribly wronged.

936
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:37,647
Grievances may be resolved
through proper compensation.

937
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:43,319
A leader must put the organization
before personal sentiments.

938
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,698
I believe you understand
what I'm trying to say.

939
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:54,455
President Shin, why don't you give us
your reasoning first?

940
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,498
Yes, sir.

941
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,959
There are three people involved.

942
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,877
A general manager, a trader,
and a staff member.

943
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,421
If someone has to take responsibility,

944
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,341
the entry-level employee
would pose the least risk.

945
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,259
And…

946
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,301
And?

947
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,513
It will also be the easiest.

948
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,058
Good.

949
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,520
Pay attention, Albert.

950
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,896
You need to learn this.

951
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,439
Watch and learn, kid.

952
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,611
I'll continue trying my best
to become a good mentor.

953
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,614
Great. Thank you very much.

954
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,466
<i>Hanmin Investment & Securities</i>

955
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,051
has decided to conclude this by firing

956
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,471
Hong Jang-mi, the entry-level minion
with a high school diploma.

957
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,807
You're their scapegoat.

958
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,814
She didn't even have dinner.

959
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,317
She'll be fine.
She's young and full of life.

960
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,568
What if Jang-mi gets fired?

961
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,278
She'll be fine. She's young.

962
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,779
She's clever.

963
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,239
She'll find another job in no time.

964
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:14,911
What?

965
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,677
It's already our second team meeting.

966
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,766
Who knew it'd be
for Ms. Hong's disciplinary hearing?

967
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,560
Ms. Hong.

968
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,362
You might be too young
to know about this masterpiece,

969
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,240
but this 1976 American film
helped shape the man I am today.

970
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,285
After a boxing match,
the protagonist, Rocky,

971
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,954
screams out, "Adrian!"

972
01:05:58,788 --> 01:05:59,830
his girlfriend's name.

973
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,208
That's when the audience realizes it.

974
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,001
He, in fact,

975
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,212
was not defeated.

976
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,465
Rocky loses on points.

977
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,220
What I'm trying to say is,

978
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,014
don't talk back in there
like you do with us.

979
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,518
And don't be too disappointed
if it doesn't go your way.

980
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,354
I can always write you
a recommendation letter.

981
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,484
More importantly, the most iconic scene
in <i>Rocky</i> isn't the final one.

982
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,990
Despite having nothing but poverty
and a tattered tank top to his name,

983
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,994
Rocky meets heavyweight champion Apollo
without backing down and declares

984
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,580
that he does not participate
in fixed fights.

985
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,751
I'll be back.

986
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,760
So you want her to get beaten up?

987
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,512
Come on, Mr. Oh.

988
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,431
No, that's not what I meant.

989
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,683
Rocky…

990
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:05,521
<i>I wasn't sure if I should tell you</i>
<i>what Hong Keum-bo had been up to.</i>

991
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,315
<i>After all that, Keum-bo joined</i>
<i>the Financial Supervisory Service</i>

992
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,901
<i>and was successful enough</i>
<i>to be called the Witch of Yeouido.</i>

993
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,653
<i>That is, before she screwed herself over.</i>

994
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,905
What do you mean by that?

995
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,200
<i>She was trying to go after Hanmin</i>
<i>and their slush fund recently,</i>

996
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,412
<i>but things went awry,</i>
<i>and she was demoted to a regional office.</i>

997
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,165
<i>Jung-woo.</i>

998
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,167
<i>Just let her be.</i>

999
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,501
<i>Don't look for her.</i>

1000
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,170
<i>She wouldn't want to see us.</i>

1001
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,130
<i>We turned our backs on her, after all.</i>

1002
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,883
<i>She was really young then too.</i>

1003
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,636
One minute.

1004
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,642
Sir, the disciplinary hearing
will start at 9:30.

1005
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,272
All right. Thank you.

1006
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,273
I'll be in touch.

What is it? Are there a lot of issues?

1010
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:52,628
Hanmin made sure
the numbers added up before sending them.

1011
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,589
They can't do that.

1012
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,718
Inflated financials, cooked books,

1013
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,554
and audit report wordplay.

1014
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,139
It's all unacceptable.

1015
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,974
- Mr. Yun.
- Yes, sir?

1016
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:08,644
You're right, the kid is bright,

01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,456
we all get to reap the benefits.

1022
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,709
A lie that benefits all.

1023
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:34,336
No such thing exists.

1024
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,754
Hey!

1025
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,174
I'll be sure to explain it to her

What an idiot.

1027
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,764
Jung-woo, can you step outside?

1028
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,743
Sorry, Keum-bo.

1029
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:09,246
I'll persuade him to do the right thing.

1030

All right. Let's see this through.

01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:23,052
- Please take good care of us.
- Thank you.

1035
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,096
Taking care of the country's economy
is no joke.

1036
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,015
- Get back safely, sir.
- Sure. Thanks.

Let's do as I say, just this once.

1043
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,664
Stay quiet.

1044
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,540
Stay quiet about what?

1045
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,834

You can't!

What does clinging to that
so-called conscience get you?

01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,763
It's not about gains.
It's about not losing it!

1052

01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,171
- Is it true?
- Me?

1059
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:06,006
<i>There are rumors</i>
<i>that an insider was involved</i>

1060
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,050
<i>in the Hanye Electronics incident.</i>

1061
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:09,218
Oh my g--

1062
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,887
I'll expose the truth.
I refuse to leave until I do.

1063
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:12,805
I refuse!

1064
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,682
What is all this?

1065
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,851
<i>Why do things keep blowing up?</i>

1066
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,603
<i>Why? I need to find Yehppee!</i>

1067
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,188
<i>I found you, my peacock!</i>

1068
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,106
<i>Do you want to hang out?</i>

1069
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:23,649
I despise romance.

1070
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,110
<i>Don't tell me you're here to see me.</i>

1071
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,237
<i>I'm not here for you, Ms. Hong Jang-mi.</i>

1072
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,531
<i>I'm here for Hong Keum-bo.</i>
