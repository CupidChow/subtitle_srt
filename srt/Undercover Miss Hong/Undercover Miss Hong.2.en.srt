1
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,954
UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

2
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,168
Who's Hong Keum-bo?

3
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,963
<i>"Hong Jang-mi's Outfit Inspiration Book</i>
<i>for a 20-Year-Old."</i>

4
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>From Hong Jang-mi.</i>
<i>To my sister, Hong Keum-bo.</i>

5
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,267
Why are you digging through my stuff?

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,685
Wait.

7
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,730
I know that face.

8
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,407
She's the top exam scorer
in the written exam.

9
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,034
We all met during the interview.

10
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,285
Right.

11
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,289
"Please conduct a thorough review
of exam questions next time."

12
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,170
Your boxes fell apart
after they got soaked in the rain.

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,881
I hauled all those soggy boxes,
and you treat me like a thief.

14
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,342
I can't believe kids nowadays.

15
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,518
Sit!

16
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,521
You need to choose rooms
and clean all this stuff up.

17
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,491
Introduce yourselves.

18
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,576
You start.

19
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,920
Keum-bo.

20
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,839
Greetings are crucial.

21
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,259
You can't say hello
like a jaded 35-year-old

22
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,677
who's had enough of this world.

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,220
A 20-year-old should sound like…

24
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,516
<i>Do, re, mi, fa, sol…</i>

25
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,643
That's it. Sol.

26
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,772
<i>Do, re, mi, fa, sol…</i>

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,733
It's nice to meet you. I'm Hong Jang-mi.

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,946
I start work at Hanmin's head office
in Yeouido tomorrow.

29
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,574
I turned 20

30
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,117
this year.

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,333
Did you say 20?

32
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,960
You look so old though.

33
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,172
Like I said, I'm 20 years old.

34
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,089
What about you?

35
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,257
I'm Go Bok-hee.

36
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,135
I've worked everywhere
from first-tier banks to securities firms,

37
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,804
and I'm currently an assistant
at Hanmin's head office in Yeouido.

38
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,805
I'm 29.

39
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,473
Next.

40
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,394
Hello. I'm Kang No…

41
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,188
Eun-joo.

42
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,607
I'm 25.

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,233
I'll also be working
in the Yeouido office.

44
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,069
So everyone's at the main office.

45
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,907
Hello. I'm Kim Mi-sook.

46
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,119
I work as a teller at the Magang Branch
of Hanmin Investment & Securities.

47
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,245
How old are you?

48
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,955
I'm 28.

49
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,791
What? I'm the oldest one here?

50
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,126
I'm the queen bee?

51
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,504
You are.

52
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,095
I use that big room over there,
so decide among yourselves.

53
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,516
Who will be my roommate?

54
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,101
Me.

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,311
I'll use the big room with you.

56
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,398
Mi-sook, I was hoping you--

57
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,900
Let's play it fair.
First-come, first-served.

58
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,325
See you later.

59
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,369
I hope we get along.

60
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,124
I can't stand the kids nowadays!

61
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,337
SEOUL CITY DORMITORY
FOR SINGLE FEMALE WORKERS

62
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,821
Wow.

63
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,329
I guess you really like stuffed animals.

64
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,247
I really do.

65
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,667
I lived in a dorm when I was in school.

66
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,712
Being surrounded by things you like
makes dorm life easier to endure.

67
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,260
Do you want to say hi?

68
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,013
These are Rachel, Phoebe,

69
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,473
and Chandler.

70
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,309
"Hi!"

71
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,195
I should shower too.

72
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,214
We got this.

73
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,219
JEMULPO GIRLS' COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL

74
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,776
<i>Let's go with pink.</i>

75
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,360
My makeup academy instructor told me

76
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,030
that one's public image
can be decided by color alone.

77
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,949
If you feel like
you're looking a bit matronly,

78
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,368
just go all pink.

79
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,090
<i>I'll befriend her</i>

80
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,177
<i>and then ask who President Kang</i>
<i>was closely acquainted with.</i>

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,931
<i>Shall I first find</i>
<i>some common ground to start?</i>

82
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,149
Wow.

83
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,193
Bok-hee, is that Gwangalli Beach?

84
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,489
That's Santa Monica Beach.

85
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,784
That's in LA, right? In the US.

86
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,619
I'm going to move there.

87
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,122
I promised myself

88
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,707
when I was around your age.

89
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,842
SANTA MONICA!
COME TO SANTA MONICA!

90
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:17,854
EXPRESS BUS TICKET
ANEON TO POSAN, MAY 1, 1988

91
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,361
Mom! Dad!

92
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,030
- My sweet daughter!
- Mom. Dad.

93
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,116
- Happy birthday, kid.
- Have you been well?

94
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,868
It must've been a long journey.
Let's go home.

95
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,119
I'll make tasty food for you.

96
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,912
I'm so hungry.

97
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,966
A SPECIAL SUMMER VACATION ABROAD
SANTA MONICA!

98
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:51,179
"IN ROMANTIC LA, UNDER THE CALIFORNIA SUN!
SANTA MONICA BEACH"

99
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>I promised myself</i>

100
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,151
<i>that I'd spend my 30th birthday</i>
<i>on Santa Monica Beach in LA.</i>

101
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,489
SANTA MONICA!

102
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,996
You'll need to make lots of money then.

103
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,124
You'll probably need about
a million dollars for the investor visa.

104
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,628
I'll become Million-Dollar Go Bok-hee.

105
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,548
By the way,
you need to clean the room every day.

106
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,426
I can't stand to look at
dust and hair rolling around

107
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,136
like tumbleweeds.

108
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,598
I can't stand them, either,

109
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,807
Bok-hee.

110
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,870
<i>Quite sensitive.</i>

111
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,038
<i>Clean.</i>

112
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,873
<i>US-obsessed.</i>

113
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,967
EPISODE 2:
BETWEEN RECRUITMENT AND INFILTRATION

114
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,693
How could I work at that office?

115
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,653
Just remember one thing.

116
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,574
Just find the cleverest, sharpest one
and stick by them, no matter what.

117
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,491
Got it?

118
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,203
Someone clever and sharp…

119
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,373
Thank you, Jang-mi.

120
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,960
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

121
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,132
<i>Right. I'm Hong Jang-mi.</i>

122
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,094
<i>I'm a 20-year-old entry-level minion,</i>
<i>Hong Jang-mi.</i>

123
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,685
ETIQUETTE REINFORCEMENT TRAINING
FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES

124
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,792
New members of the Hanmin family,
it's nice to meet you all.

125
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,045
I'm Song Ju-ran, the Chief of Staff.

126
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,177
After the morning training,

127
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,971
you will each be assigned
to your departments.

128
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,892
Please check the personnel appointment
on the bulletin board later on.

129
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,353
And it's nothing grand,

130
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,397
but we've prepared
welcome gifts for you all.

131
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,110
101 THINGS YOU MUST DO IN YOUR TWENTIES

132
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,124
101 THINGS YOU MUST DO IN YOUR TWENTIES

133
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,959
Who has time for 101 things?

134
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,222
Ms. Go Bok-hee here
will lead the morning training.

135
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,350
Here's to an uplifting corporate life
for all of you.

136
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,852
Let's all give it our best shot.
You got this!

137
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,020
- We got this!
- We got this!

138
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:29,939
You got this.

139
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,701
All entry-level female employees
in the head office and all branches

140
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,787
wear the same uniform.

141
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,124
Women's locker rooms
are available for wardrobe changes.

142
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,917
Wardrobe?

143
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,836
A robe like <i>hanbok</i>?

144
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,048
Wardrobe as in what you're wearing,
so changing in and out of the uniform.

145
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,843
I see. You're so smart.

146
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:06,100
You can change into your uniforms
during the ten-minute break.

147
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,643
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

148
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,103
Right.

149
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,835
Long hair must be pulled back
without flyaways

150
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,044
and finished with a neat hair net.

151
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,548
Tights should be at least 30 denier.

152
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,551
Tights? It's still so hot outside.

153
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,720
That's right.

154
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,680
You're the only one
without them right now.

155
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,859
At Hanmin, we believe in the 119 Campaign.

156
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,403
During company dinners,
we drink one type of alcohol,

157
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,446
for one round only,

158
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,490
and wrap up by nine<i>.</i>

159
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,619
Those of you overseeing expense reports
should take special note.

160
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,870
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

161
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,206
What should we have for lunch?

162
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,043
Next, we'll discuss meeting protocols.

163
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,135
Jang-mi, I got this.

164
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,513
My mom gave me extra spending money
to treat my colleagues…

165
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,848
Save your money.

166
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,142
It's expensive to live in Seoul,

167
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,810
Eun-joo.

168
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,317
No one has ever told me

169
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,611
to save my money.

170
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,363
Are you ready to order?

171
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,698
You want the bulgogi sandwich?

172
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,659
We'll take three.

173
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>I'll naturally treat Go Bok-hee to lunch</i>

174
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,544
<i>and get on her good side.</i>

175
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,508
Have you no respect for your senior?

176
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,013
You dare to talk smack about me
behind my back?

177
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,266
Isn't speaking with tact
a basic assistant virtue?

178
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,352
Who says the new president
will have a new assistant?

179
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,939
We have degrees in secretarial studies
from four-year universities.

180
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,192
If anything, we're more well-versed
in assistant virtues.

181
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,280
A teller from a regional branch
becomes the president's assistant

182
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,240
and thinks she's one herself.

183
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,492
- What?
- It's no wonder people thought

184
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,202
you were President Kang's "companion."

185
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,788
The rumors began because
that seemed like the only explanation.

186
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,752
So the rat responsible
for those vulgar rumors

187
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,379
was you.

188
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,343
Oh no.

189
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,305
You'd better let go of me right now!

190
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,223
- Let go of her.
- Stop it.

191
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,851
Who are you, country bumpkins?

192
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,102
Country bumpkins?

193
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,145
Oh my gosh.

194
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,521
She cursed me out.

195
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,567
Let's not resort to name-calling.
We're all educated women here.

196
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,237
As if you all are "educated."

197
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,531
You're just entry-level minions
with commercial high school diplomas.

198
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,080
I've never been so disrespected
and belittled in my life.

199
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,916
You, lock the door.

200
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,167
- Okay.
- What?

201
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,418
Wait. Why are you locking the door?

202
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,711
- Why…
- You stay right there.

203
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,842
Like this!

204
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,057
- Bok-hee!
- Bok-hee, are you okay?

205
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,033
Let go!

206
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,285
- You'd better let go of me!
- You let go.

207
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,955
Let go. Let go of me right now!

208
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,248
Jang-mi!

209
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,375
Get up!

210
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,126
Wake up!

211
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,046
Jang-mi!

212
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,304
I went easy on you!
You'd better thank your lucky stars!

213
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:17,935
Jang-mi.

214
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,062
Are you okay?

215
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,897
What if she got a concussion?

216
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
Embarrassment doesn't cause concussions.

217
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,028
Get up.

218
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,578
Mind your business from now on.

219
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,546
Jang-mi.

220
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,297
How many fingers do you see?

221
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,147
Why is she so strong?

222
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,523
FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES ONLY
DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR VIOLATIONS

223
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,906
Jang-mi, are you all right?

224
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,033
Yeah, sure.

225
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,410
The assignments were posted.
We're both on the seventh floor.

226
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,538
I'm assigned to Trading,
and you're in Risk Management.

227
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,331
Risk Management?

228
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,132
RISK MANAGEMENT, RESEARCH,
CONFERENCE ROOM

229
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,427
Is Research under Risk Management?

230
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,269
MANAGER LEE YONG-GI
RISK MANAGEMENT, PHD IN ENGINEERING

231
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,690
Are you Ms. Hong, the new hire?

232
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,317
Yes.

233
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,027
Shall we?

234
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,066
We need to go a bit farther.

235
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,041
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

236
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,294
This is it.

237
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,766
Hey.

238
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,230
<i>Do, re, mi, fa, sol…</i>

239
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,648
Hello.

240
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,692
I'm Hong Jang-mi.

241
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,777
Oh no!

242
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,112
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION
DIVISION MANAGER ALBERT OH

243
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,618
I didn't know

244
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,954
this was lodged in there.

245
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,373
I paid a week's worth of late fees.

246
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:30,043
I've repeatedly told the cleaning staff
not to clean my desk.

247
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,630
How could they not clean
the division manager's desk?

248
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,175
Just let it go
and say hello to the new hire.

249
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,054
<i>Is it that guy…</i>

250
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,765
TO YOU FROM ME

251
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,146
<i>…who took </i>To You from Me?

252
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,774
I swear it's not late

253
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,319
because I watched one particular scene

254
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,529
over and over.

255
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,156
Watch it.

256
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,992
She just turned 20 and is barely an adult,

257
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,493
even if she looks a bit old.

258
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,016
Oh right. What's the new president's name?

259
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,476
No idea.

260
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,978
They want us at his appointment ceremony.

261
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,481
We'll find out then.

262
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,735
HANMIN PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

263
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,782
Hey, over here.

264
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,165
PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO

265
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,208
Kid!

266
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,753
Entry-level female staff
should sit in the back.

267
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,097
Jang-mi, over here.

268
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,851
Why that little…

269
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:28,912
This way.

270
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,838
Please welcome President Shin Jung-woo.

271
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,733
Hello.

272
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,028
I'm the newest member
of Hanmin Investment & Securities,

273
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,154
Shin Jung-woo.

274
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,120
Hanmin is, in name and reality,
a first-rate company that has led

275
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,330
Korea's financial industry.

276
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,334
However, the times are demanding change.

277
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,968
What do you want to eat later?

278
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:27,929
Jang-mi?

279
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,720
Act natural.

280
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,598
There's nothing natural about you.
Aren't you hot?

281
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,312
The new president showed up today, right?

282
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,190
Director Yun,

283
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,234
is our intel-gathering prowess
really that limited?

284
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,236
If I'd known
that Shin Jung-woo would be joining,

285
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,155
I'd never have set foot in Hanmin,
undercover my ass.

286
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,324
You know him?

287
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,912
We were on the same team
at my old accounting firm,

288
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,498
college alums before that, and…

289
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,377
And shared a passionate romance?

290
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,504
It was passionate…

291
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,381
No.

292
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,174
It was nothing but pure.

293
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,391
12 YEARS AGO, 1985

294
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,796
FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE CPA

295
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,885
Jung-woo.

296
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,512
Keum-bo, congratulations on passing.

297
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,102
Jung-woo.

298
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,564
Keum-bo, look at this.

299
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,734
THE TOP SCORER WAS
MS. HONG KEUM-BO, 23, SEOUN UNIVERSITY

300
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,445
You should dress warmer.

301
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,030
I'm fine.

302
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,992
But what about you?

303
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:55,911
There.

304
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,245
I also passed.

305
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,582
I'm so proud of my boyfriend.

306
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,584
Congratulations, Shin Jung-woo.

307
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,591
I'm so happy.

308
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,760
Congratulations.

309
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,928
Congratulations.

310
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,271
Ms. Hong.

311
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,232
Please review the information at the top.

312
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,114
STAR CONSTRUCTION, MARCH INVOICE
FROM MARCH 1ST-31ST, 1987

313
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,893
How many times have you seen the head
of the Financial Supervisory Service?

314
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,438
What are the chances
of an entry-level female employee

315
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,983
running into the president
on the top floor?

316
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:09,901
Low, right?

317
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,612
How's the department?

318
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,824
The Risk Management Division
has an impressive name,

319
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,743
but it's just a hole in the wall
inside the Research Division office.

320
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,413
Albert Oh, the division manager,

321
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,039
is Executive Director Oh Deok-gyu's son.

322
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,666
Man, he's already a division manager?

323
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,003
It must be nice
to be the chairman's grandson.

324
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,338
I thought I might
get something out of him,

325
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,466
but he's just a clueless
25-year-old silver spoon kid.

326
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,884
He's a good-for-nothing loafer.

327
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,057
<i>I heard he was secretly studying film</i>
<i>in the US before being dragged back.</i>

328
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,101
<i>He just spends all day</i>
<i>in the office watching movies.</i>

329
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,150
<i>Bang Jin-mok,</i>
<i>Yehppee Candidate 2, is no better.</i>

330
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,820
<i>The office for that perpetual manager is</i>

331
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,613
<i>just a comic book store that pays him.</i>

332
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,951
<i>Manager Lee has a PhD in engineering</i>

333
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,786
<i>and he's the cyber banking developer.</i>

334
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,623
<i>He spends all day coding</i>
<i>when he works at a securities firm.</i>

335
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,127
That office is a hot mess.

336
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,587
No one works there.

337
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,922
Ridiculous. You shouldn't, either.

338
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,717
How dare they do that
in front of a Financial Supervisory ace?

339
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,513
Befriend that assistant
and just get the intel you need.

340
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,848
Then focus on finding Yehppee.

341
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,308
Okay.

342
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,811
Director, you dig into
Go Bok-hee some more and report back.

343
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,981
Find out what her reputation was
at her previous job as well.

344
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,818
"Look into Go Bok-hee's reputation."

345
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,964
Nora has been assigned
to the Trading Division as you requested.

346
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,549
Is that so?

347
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,177
How long do you think she'll last?

348
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,640
You offered her a 9% stake in the company
after three months.

349
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,393
Even if Nora wants to give up,

350
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,437
there's no way Madam Choi will let her.

351
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,149
Why don't you lend her a hand as well?

352
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,445
Unfortunately, she takes after her mother.

353
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,157
She could use some support.

354
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,743
Who could be more qualified than you?

355
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,664
Check in on her at the office and the dorm

356
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,125
whenever you have a spare moment.

357
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,378
I will, sir.

358
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,796
Good.

359
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,510
Hello. Come in.

360
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,679
- I'll leave you two to talk.
- All right.

361
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,476
One day,

362
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,148
we'll be able to trade stocks anywhere
as long as we have a computer.

363
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,985
Myeong-hwi used to
talk about that as well.

364
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,951
I'm talking about my son.

365
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,371
I see.

366
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,498
That should cut labor costs.

367
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,584
How much do you think they'll drop?

368
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,756
I haven't done the exact calculations yet.

369
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,676
All right.
We can crunch the numbers as we go.

370
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,431
There are two things I want to ask of you

371
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,141
as the new president.

372
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,184
First,

373
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,853
I'd like you to turn around

374
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,191
the unrest inside the company
since the prosecution's investigation.

375
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,235
Second,

376
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:45,200
there has been a lot of talk
about the Hanmin heir.

377
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,246
I may have a daughter,

378
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,707
but if it's all the same,

379
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,585
a boy will be better.

380
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:01,466
I wish to have my grandson be my heir…

381
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,595
but he still has a long way to go.

382
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,722
His father is no better.

383
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,894
I was hoping to have you,
President Shin Jung-woo,

384
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:18,608
become my grandson's tutor.

385
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,740
I am far from perfect,

386
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,202
but I'll try my best
to fulfill both roles.

387
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,706
Good. Thank you.

388
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,940
Hey.

389
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,359
How could the chairman do this to me?

390
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,861
He chose an external hire over me?

391
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,697
Some kid,
still wet behind the ears, at that.

392
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,448
Damn it.

393
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,952
Can you be any more nonchalant about this?

394
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,872
Freaking out about it
won't change a thing.

395
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,624
What happened
to me staying quietly in the background?

396
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,252
That was before I knew
President Kang would die.

397
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:23,631
Do you really want to lose our company
to Nora, that scatterbrained fool?

398
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,466
Dad.

399
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,760
It was never ours to begin with.

400
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,930
We need to make it ours.

401
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,350
Listen to me, son.

402
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,061
I'm betting my life on this investment.

403
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,064
Dad.

404
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,983
Investments

405
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,235
can result in a loss of principal.

406
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,030
You know that, right?

407
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,117
I wasn't done, you punk.

408
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,994
Executive Director Oh, good luck!

409
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,332
Who does that kid take after?

410
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,585
<i>The computerization of stock trading</i>
<i>will begin on September 1st.</i>

411
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,004
<i>This will allow investors</i>

412
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,466
<i>to freely carry out their transactions</i>
<i>wherever they wish,</i>

413
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,384
<i>whether it be at the office or at home.</i>

414
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,720
<i>A vibrant securities market</i>
<i>is anticipated…</i>

415
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,014
- Hello?
<i>- Have you met with Chairman Kang yet?</i>

416
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,974
<i>That geezer must be dying inside.</i>

417
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,936
<i>He spent a fortune scouting you.</i>

418
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,063
Well,

419
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,650
I didn't return to Seoul
just for the money.

420
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,403
I need to stay focused.

421
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,655
Hey, Ms. Hong!

422
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,740
Commercial high! Uniform girl! You!

423
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,992
Yeah, I'm calling you.

424
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,999
<i>Right. I'm Hong Jang-mi.</i>

425
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,670
<i>I'm a 20-year-old high school grad</i>
<i>working as an entry-level minion.</i>

426
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,423
My name is Hong Jang-mi.

427
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,008
Right. Ms. Hong.

428
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,304
These are the files
for the division heads' meeting tomorrow.

429
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,390
Deliver them to Admin.

430
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,850
Now.

431
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,935
Me?

432
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,062
Just email them.

433
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,855
You have a computer.
Embrace the new millennium.

434
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,025
If you're still here then,
feel free to update the protocol.

435
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,527
Until that day comes,

436
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,737
you, Ms. Hong,

437
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,823
will deliver it safely and promptly.

438
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,165
<i>Hold on.</i>

439
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,377
<i>This obnoxious jerk could be Yehppee.</i>

440
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,087
GENERAL MANAGER CHA JUNG-IL
RESEARCH DIVISION, HANMIN

441
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,296
YEHPPEE CANDIDATE

442
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,673
<i>Bite your tongue.</i>

443
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,509
<i>This will give you official access</i>
<i>to the Research Division office.</i>

444
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,720
Here I go.

445
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,477
This is so damn heavy.

446
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,773
Why hasn't Go Bok-hee been fired yet?

447
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,234
Just tell her no if she asks for help.

448
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,153
What if she tells on us to Ms. Song?

449
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:53,156
If the three of us get our story straight,
she'll end up the liar.

450
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,576
<i>Go Bok-hee must be the outcast of Admin.</i>

451
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,493
Oh right.

452
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,954
I looked into that girl
who fell on her face in the break room.

453
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,539
She's Hong Jang-mi, a new hire.

454
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,125
She was quite the rebel
at Jemulpo Girls' Commercial High School.

455
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,168
She's badass.

456
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,502
She sounds like a meathead.

457
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,962
How did she ever end up here?

458
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,882
But she seemed pretty weak that day.

459
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,052
Maybe she's cleaning up her image.

460
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,524
NOTICE OF TERMINATION

461
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,030
Ms. Go, we'll have you stay on
until Chuseok in September.

462
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,992
And put together an outline of duties
for your successor.

463
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,077
Ms. Song.

464
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,830
Is there any way I can stay
just until my brother is released?

465
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,499
President Kang is dead.

466
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,377
You have no reason to be here anymore.

467
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,673
Thank you for running my errands
all this time.

468
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,842
You'll find another job
with your experience.

469
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,265
Do you know who my successor is?

470
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,271
- Welcome.
- Welcome to the team.

471
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,616
What did President Shin Jung-woo do
before joining our company?

472
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,742
Hey, give me a cigarette.

473
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,203
What did Mr. Cha
from Research say earlier?

474
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,830
Oh, about Shin Jung-woo?

475
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,748
He got an economics degree
from Seoun University,

476
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,667
then worked for
one of the top four accounting firms

477
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,002
before getting his MBA in Boston.

478
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,255
He worked at a private equity fund
in Hong Kong until now.

479
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,757
And he's unmarried.

480
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,802
<i>Sounds like he's led a busy life.</i>

481
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,720
He sounds like a great man.

482
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,557
Mr. Oh must be disappointed.

483
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,225
I'm sure he assumed he'd get the position

484
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,227
and probably got his hopes up.

485
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,272
My dad is not disappointed.

486
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,732
He's green with envy.

487
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,028
Is he? Right.

488
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,321
That's more like it.

489
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,073
<i>Bang Jin-mok.</i>

490
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,410
<i>He speaks his mind,</i>
<i>regardless of seniority.</i>

491
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,163
<i>And Albert doesn't seem to take offense.</i>

492
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,207
Is that your type?

493
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,585
- Pardon?
- Shin Jung-woo.

494
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,170
What?

495
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:16,007
President Shin must seem like a knight
in shining armor in Ms. Hong's eyes.

496
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,592
He's quite a successful man, right?

497
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,635
Me?

498
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,056
I don't want a successful man.
I just want success for myself.

499
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,600
And I look at the whole package.

500
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,018
I inspect carefully.

501
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,102
She cares about looks.

502
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,979
- She wants the complete package.
- Right.

503
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,442
- Come on, let's drink up.
- Welcome to the team.

504
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,161
In the future, it won't be
one landline per household.

505
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,663
It'll be one wireless phone per person.

506
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,499
A "pocket computer," if you will.

507
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,709
He's definitely out there.

508
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,836
With the computer
in the palm of your hand,

509
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,005
you'll be able to make calls
and go on the Internet.

510
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,634
You should be an inventor,
not working at a securities firm.

511
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,512
What a great loss
for Korea's scientific community.

512
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,597
Then,

513
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,643
will we be able to watch movies
on our cellphones too?

514
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,062
- Gosh…
- If our cellphones can go online,

515
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,480
then we could even trade stocks.

516
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,690
- Stocks…
- Look at you go.

517
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,694
Talk about how cars in the future
won't require drivers next,

518
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,029
why don't you?

519
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:20,988
That's not a bad idea.

520
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,114
Good.

521
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,742
That's not what's important right now.

522
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,870
Who cares if we get along now?

523
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,748
The farewell party will happen
right after Chuseok anyway.

524
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,250
- Just drink.
- A farewell party?

525
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,126
Who's leaving?

526
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,755
Don't tell me you are, Mr. Bang.

527
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,008
A FAREWELL PARTY FOR HIM?

528
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,343
YEHPPEE CANDIDATE!
COULD HE REALLY BE YEHPPEE?

529
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,220
Not him.

530
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,263
Why would I leave?

531
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,182
We're talking about you, obviously.

532
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,893
You're just our foster child
for the time being.

533
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,144
Foster?

534
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,980
Me?

535
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,232
What do you mean you're fostering me?

536
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,900
Hold on.

537
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,279
- Mr. Lee? What?
- We're fostering you.

538
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,740
It's already 8:48. We have no time!

539
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,575
- Let's get going.
- Run.

540
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,827
- Run!
- To where?

541
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,537
Wait, Mr. Bang,
finish what you were saying.

542
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,205
- Go!
- Am I going somewhere? Am I getting fired?

543
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,999
If you do well now, I'll tell you.

544
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,209
Seafood <i>pajeon</i>, whelk soup,
two beers and two soju.

545
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,128
- Go!
- Go!

546
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,090
- Where are we going?
- Round two.

547
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,633
You've heard about
the 119 Campaign, right?

548
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,135
One round, one type of alcohol…

549
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,720
And disband before 9 p.m.!

550
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,682
That's code for
no corporate card after nine.

551
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,976
So we're running for drinks?

552
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,561
To make the company pay for it?

553
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,604
But still, having someone to run with

554
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,440
makes it less embarrassing.

555
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,026
Well, I'm super embarrassed.

556
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,069
It's 8:55! Run!

557
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,237
Ms. Hong!

558
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,783
We'll have seafood <i>pajeon</i>, whelk soup,
two beers and two soju!

559
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,035
Swipe that card. Hurry!

560
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,542
All right.

561
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,174
Wow, 8:59:59. Safe!

562
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,383
Let me see.

563
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,803
Ms. Hong, you pass!

564
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,221
Finally, a reason to like you.

565
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,935
Enjoy.

566
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,687
Now, tell me.

567
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,022
This foster business.

568
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,732
We have a new president now.

569
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,692
New boss, new assistant.

570
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,445
I'm supposed to be
Ms. Go Bok-hee's successor?

571
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,408
They want me to be
President Shin Jung-woo's assistant?

572
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,118
So you see…

573
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,163
I guess, during your interview,

574
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,832
you left quite an impression on Ms. Song.

575
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,085
Meanwhile, Ms. Go lost some points

576
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,170
for failing to prevent
that exam question error.

577
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,090
Not to mention,
she's a 29-year-old spinster.

578
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,927
In the head office,
high school grads never make it past 30.

579
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,720
It's straight to
a regional branch for them.

580
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,306
Since this is round two,
should we talk more science?

581
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,933
Does Go Bok-hee know about this?

582
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,257
Sir.

583
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,552
I heard a new high-school-grad hire
is to take my place.

584
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,389
I may not have an associate's
or a bachelor's in secretarial studies,

585
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,893
but I do have more experience
than a 20-year-old just starting out.

586
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,355
If you give me the chance to prove myself,

587
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,233
I'll do my utmost best to assist
as you adjust to life in Korea--

588
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,528
Ms. Song took care of
all the necessary details already.

589
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,737
And regarding my assistant,

590
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,824
I believe that's up to
the administrative office to decide.

591
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,035
Yes, sir.

592
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,080
If there's coffee or a dish you prefer--

593
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:58,998
Ms. Go.

594
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,500
Fetching meals or coffee

595
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,669
isn't how you truly assist someone.

596
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,604
Damn it.

597
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,638
Ms. Hong, you've been appointed
as President Shin's new assistant.

598
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,141
Be sure to teach her well
this week, Ms. Go.

599
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,687
Ms. Go, your last day
will be September 13th.

600
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,025
Ms. Hong, you'll start at the admin office
after the Chuseok break.

601
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,444
Any questions?

602
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,657
<i>There's no way I can be</i>
<i>Shin Jung-woo's assistant.</i>

603
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,784
Ms. Song.

604
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,623
BEYOND THE HAN RIVER, TO THE WORLD!
TO THE FUTURE!

605
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,959
This was the ad
for Hanmin's late 1997 intake

606
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,711
of female staff members
with high school diplomas.

607
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,256
The admin staff was not listed.

608
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,883
I specifically applied
for a management support position.

609
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,053
So?

610
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,681
Being in Admin never even crossed my--

611
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,099
Let it cross now.

612
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,147
The biggest misconception rookies can have
about entering the workforce.

613
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,943
You think you choose the company?

614
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,153
No.

615
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,408
The companies choose,
and they decide where to use you.

616
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,912
If you don't like that,
you should leave the workforce.

617
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:03,789
Do you want to quit?

618
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,230
I don't drink vending machine coffee.

619
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,821
You'll be the president's assistant.

620
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,947
Who would turn that down?

621
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,411
I'd rather not work with those assistants
I fought with in the break room.

622
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,791
You didn't put up much of a fight.
The fighting was very much one-sided.

623
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,380
Bok-hee.

624
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,799
Shin Jung-woo doesn't appreciate change.

625
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,427
Once he sees
what you're capable of firsthand,

626
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,012
he won't ask for a new assistant.

627
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,014
How do you know that?

628
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,308
Also,

629
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,894
you can't call him by his name.
He's not your friend.

630
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,021
Are you going to call the chairman
by his name next?

631
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,814
You mean Kang Pil-beom?

632
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,942
This is what's wrong with kids nowadays.

633
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,569
What if someone hears you?

634
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,613
There's no one here.

635
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,325
Who would you say the late President Kang

636
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,369
was closest to at the company?

637
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,414
If there was a general manager
he was close to, they might help you out.

638
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,418
Try making an earnest plea.

639
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,379
I could come with you.

640
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,264
Come on.

641
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,809
Who would help out
an assistant with no boss?

642
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,686
Jeez.

643
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,648
She's a tough one.

644
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,903
Maybe she's really trying to help me?

645
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,210
My Albert.

646
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,421
Oh Deok-gyu Jr.

647
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,381
Is he doing well?

648
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,133
You know, Big Al is

649
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,427
a remarkable man.

650
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,680
Really?

651
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,183
If you had to give specific examples?

652
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,812
Frankly, no one would say anything

653
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,690
if someone of his stature
only showed up twice a week.

654
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,443
Despite that,
he still shows up, all six days.

655
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,113
You know,

656
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,198
he really leads by example.

657
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,366
That's what I think.

658
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,125
Punctuality is fundamental
in any organization.

659
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,710
But you know,

660
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,130
that punctuality
never helps you stand out.

661
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,007
Just look at President Shin.

662
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,718
His flashy résumé crafts his public image.

663
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,846
Maybe he's so obnoxious
because he feels like he's above us?

664
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,391
He has yet to pay me a visit
to introduce himself.

665
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,270
That's a bit problematic.

666
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,481
- You think so too, right?
- Yes.

667
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,192
That's why I'm going all out
for his initiation.

668
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,237
The chairman is known
to unleash a barrage of questions

669
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,740
at every first all-hands meeting
of the quarter, right?

670
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:28,744
Yes, that's why the Research Division
prepares a list of possible questions

671
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,287
and answers for you, every quarter.

672
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,747
Right, that's it.

673
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,041
But President Shin
doesn't know about that yet.

674
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,209
He does not.

675
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,336
Not yet.

676
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,672
Seeing Shin Jung-woo flush red
after failing to answer a question

677
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,216
the chairman ambushed him with…

678
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,595
Man, just imagining it gives me chills.

679
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,596
Who am I?

680
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,640
I am <i>the </i>Oh Deok-gyu,
but he doesn't know that.

681
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,393
So, tell me.

682
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,729
Do you plan on…

683
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,399
aligning yourself
with that figurehead President Shin?

684
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:19,878
Yeah.

685
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,964
I need something to grab onto.

686
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,675
I can just switch sides if things go awry.

687
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,261
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

688
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,766
Ms. Hong, delivery time.

689
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,894
It's for the Monday weekly meeting,

690
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,771
so just deliver the whole thing to Admin.

691
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,616
Jeez, always sending me
to deliver this and that.

692
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,285
Why can't he write a damn email?

693
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,002
Shall I take a look at
what he wrote in the report?

694
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,257
Nothing much, apparently.

695
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,677
Equity Management Division?

696
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,263
WEEKLY MEETING OUTLINE
FINANCIAL TRENDS AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

697
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,982
Why is the report
for the president's office different?

698
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,590
What's with the loitering?

699
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,758
Are you here to claim your future?

700
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:51,094
What is this list of
model questions and answers about?

701
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,472
To prepare for the chairman's
rapid-fire questions

702
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,641
at the first quarterly meeting.

703
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,017
Research is in charge of that.

704
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,144
But why is it missing
from President Shin's report?

705
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,063
What? Let me see.

706
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,195
It's really missing.

707
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,197
It's only missing from his report.

708
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,909
Mr. Cha definitely reviewed it all
before giving it to me.

709
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,243
Could it have been intentional?

710
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,330
Cha Jung-il, that jerk.

711
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,791
He's a master at stirring trouble,
shifting blame, and backing out.

712
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,377
That accounting question error
you pointed out?

713
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,003
I told him about it before you.

714
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,047
He just ignored me and let it slip by.

715
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,675
<i>She really hates him.</i>

716
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,760
You can tell by his face.

717
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,137
He looks shameless and slick.

718
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,515
No wonder he had that long meeting
with Executive Director Oh.

719
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,933
He's clearly aligning himself with Oh.

720
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:40,936
How about this?

721
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,815
While the old guard
is messing with the newcomer,

722
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,360
you swoop in and show President Shin
how capable an assistant you are.

723
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,613
You make him realize
that experience can't be beat.

724
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,614
What do you say?

725
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,342
I was just stabbed in the back

726
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,386
by everyone I trusted,
from Ms. Song to the assistants.

727
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,597
Why would I trust a rookie like you?

728
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,726
Don't get crafty with me.

729
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,519
I know you're after my position.

730
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,607
Would I have hidden like that
if I were after your job?

731
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,193
I would've stuck my head out
to have him notice me.

732
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,240
THE UTMOST BEST!

733
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,828
People think working hard
is how you do your "utmost best."

734
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,204
But that's wrong.

735
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,915
Utmost, "to the fullest." Best, "outwit."

736
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,002
Outwitting your opponent to the fullest
is doing your "utmost best."

737
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,421
This is a win-win for you and me.

738
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,006
Good, no?

739
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:56,887
THE UTMOST BEST!

740
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,014
Be on standby after work.

741
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,849
Until I call for you, all right?

742
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,905
Come to the admin office.

743
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:19,117
President Shin left for the day, right?

744
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,369
Don't worry and come already.

745
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,371
I'll be right there.

746
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,168
Equity Management's answer sheet
will go to Trading.

747
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,045
Trading's answer sheet
will go to Accounting.

748
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,548
We'll mix up
all the general managers' reports

749
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,176
and make sure President Shin
is the only one with answers.

750
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,344
What if we get caught?

751
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,221
We'll say it's a simple binding error.

752
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,932
If anyone is held responsible,
it should be Mr. Cha.

753
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,934
Research is in charge of the reports,
after all.

754
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:47,229
Aren't you a bit too young
to be stirring up this kind of trouble?

755
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,814
I'm just giving it my all.

756
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,025
We'll be fired immediately
if we're caught.

757
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,528
Bok-hee.

758
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,321
You've already been fired.

759
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,098
Let's leave the rest of the files
in the conference room before we go.

760
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,559
Okay. When did Jung…

761
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,435
I mean, when did
President Shin leave for the day?

762
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,437
He hasn't. He's still here.

763
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,649
He's still here?

764
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,401
It's fine.

765
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,653
You've been here since seven,
and it's ten now,

766
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,821
but that door hasn't opened once.

767
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,322
In fact,

768
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,492
he's been working late every day
ever since he joined on September 1st.

769
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,077
He's been reviewing

770
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,705
three years' worth of annual,
quarterly, and monthly business plans,

771
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,124
investment performance,
and even media trends.

772
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,459
He doesn't even stop to eat.

773
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,378
I asked him what he liked to eat,

774
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,714
and he told me
that's not how you truly assist someone.

775
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,383
Just order him a pizza. He likes pizza.

776
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,635
How do you know?

777
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,643
Risk Management is where
all the guys hang out and chat.

778
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,478
Right.

779
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,735
By the way, can't we finish the rest
back at our dorm?

780
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,239
So we can operate covertly
and with more precision?

781
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,335
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE REPORT

782
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,177
Come in.

783
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:57,359
I brought a pizza
since it seemed like you skipped dinner.

784
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,321
Sir.

785
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,032
If you're planning to work
well into the night again,

786
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,785
do you mind if I go home first?

787
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,414
Sure. Go ahead.

788
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,208
Thank you, sir.

789
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,149
The man who turned down
burgers, sandwiches, and salads

790
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,275
accepted the pizza tonight.

791
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,072
Why are you helping me?

792
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,409
After 29 years,
I've learned there's no such thing

793
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,828
as free goodwill or charity.

794
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,124
I told you this is for me, not you.

795
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,544
Also, we're roommates.

796
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,177
If things don't work out,

797
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,973
we can pick up a box of ribs
and visit President Kang's trusted ally.

798
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,683
I'll kneel and beg right next to you.

799
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,395
They're not really
the type to accept bribes.

800
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,522
Ribs aren't cheap, either.

801
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,609
It'll still be cheaper than your life.

802
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,113
And what might their name be?

803
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,824
Focus. You made a typo.

804
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,662
There.

805
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,673
Why are we going in early today?

806
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,800
We have our weekly meeting today.

807
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,928
After that break room brawl,
the other assistants and Queen Bee…

808
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,680
Oh my god.

809
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,392
It's 7:45 now.

810
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,061
We'll update the president

811
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,563
and head to the weekly meeting for 8:30.

812
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,405
- What?
- What's wrong?

813
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,407
The meeting was moved up.

814
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,743
It's going to start in 15 minutes!

815
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,952
What?

816
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,746
- Let's run.
- Okay.

817
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,498
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

818
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,638
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

819
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,683
Where's Ms. Go?

820
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,982
How am I the only one who didn't know?

821
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,400
Isn't it obvious?

822
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,778
The smug trio of assistants
is trying to screw you over.

823
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:54,369
No assistant should be late
to the weekly meeting.

824
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,537
Why, you…

825
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,372
Urgent matter comes first.

826
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,958
Wait!

827
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,402
My word.

828
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,243
This is ridiculous.

829
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,383
Not a single person here

830
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,136
can answer my question?

831
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,180
You're all just
silently flipping some pages!

832
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,056
Unbelievable.

833
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,851
This is not the time

834
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,145
for you to leisurely sip some damn coffee!

835
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,356
Get rid of it all!

836
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,485
I can't believe this.

837
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,780
Hey, get in here. Hurry!

838
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,077
- Let's go.
- That little…

839
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,128
Bring back all the coffee cups.

840
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,595
WEEKLY MEETING OUTLINE

841
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,952
President Shin.

842
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,622
Let me ask you a few questions.

843
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,583
Please go ahead, sir.

844
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,002
Well…

845
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,134
Who in the world…

846
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,554
Go!

847
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,390
Sorry.

848
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,307
Why…

849
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,444
<i>These are anticipated Q&As</i>
<i>for the chairman.</i>

850
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,487
<i>Must read!</i>

851
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,324
I should grab the broom.

852
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,339
So damn embarrassing!

853
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,761
How could they hire such dumb girls?

854
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,388
Are you serious right now?

855
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:04,100
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

856
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:05,727
You.

857
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,025
How dare you hold your head high

858
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,152
when you've done nothing right?

859
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,824
Damn it.

860
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:22,952
"Damn it"?

861
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,496
"Damn it"?

862
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,291
Damn it!

863
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,837
I did it, okay?

864
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,006
Don't take it out on them.

865
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,426
We're the ones screwed, not you.

866
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,555
Don't just stand there!

867
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,140
Let's go.

868
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,946
That damn runt.

869
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,283
Big Al, what do you mean we're screwed?

870
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:08,414
The president wants all materials,
from reports to briefings, to be digitized

871
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,874
and shared company-wide.

872
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,210
Through an information-sharing system?

873
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,169
Who's making it?

874
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:14,796
That's the issue.

875
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:16,756
The Risk Management Division.

876
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,592
What?

877
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,219
They want us to make it.

878
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,221
Can we really?

879
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,641
Goodness.

880
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,850
My heart is racing already.

881
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,978
I'm sure you'll do well, Mr. Lee.

882
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,316
Well, who's going to be
the president's assistant?

883
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,697
The executives and general managers
don't bother studying the data

884
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,616
and just memorize a script made by others?

885
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,244
This is not a path to company growth.

886
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:51,416
Thanks to you, I found out how outdated
this company's practices are.

887
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,049
Ms. Song, this is Shin Jung-woo.

888
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,011
A new president with a new assistant
could make things difficult for everyone.

889
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,681
I'll continue working with Ms. Go.

890
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,308
Take care.

891
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:10,768
Did you hear that?

892
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:16,441
Sir, that means I can continue
working as your assistant, right?

893
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,900
Yes, that's right.

894
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,904
It seems you and I share similar views
on the market and the organization.

895
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:22,905
Especially,

896
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,575
your proposal to implement
an information-sharing system.

897
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,285
LEE YONG-GI, CYBER BANKING DEVELOPER
RECOMMENDED

898
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:30,246
Recommending the cyber banking developer
to oversee the project

899
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,956
was also insightful.

900
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,421
DEVELOP AN INFORMATION-SHARING SYSTEM

901
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,840
<i>That was all Hong Jang-mi.</i>

902
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,509
I hope this works out.

903
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,511
Thank you, sir.

904
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,514
I promise to do
my utmost best going forward.

905
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,060
By the way, Ms. Go.

906
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,188
Yes, sir?

907
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,275
The pizza from the other night…

908
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,029
Did you know that I liked pizza?

909
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,407
It wasn't my idea.

910
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,327
A younger staff member recommended it.

911
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,537
It was my roommate's idea.

912
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,042
I finally get to toss this out.

913
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,377
Hey, you!

914
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,464
Do you know how important
the weekly meetings are?

915
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,883
You can't push us college grads
aside and barge in!

916
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,305
Hey, you!

917
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,854
I'm not "Hey, you." I'm Hong Jang-mi.

918
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,899
I'm Hong Jang-mi
from Jemulpo Girls' Commercial High.

919
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,985
What? You have a problem
with commercial high schools?

920
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,113
- No.
- No.

921
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,157
Then why do you look down on it?

922
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,453
Surely, you didn't learn that in college.

923
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,998
Should you tease
and bully your colleagues or not?

924
01:03:58,584 --> 01:03:59,919
- You shouldn't.
- You shouldn't.

925
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,464
If I catch you three
pulling one more cheap trick,

926
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:08,886
I'll show you why they used to call me
the badass meathead.

927
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,184
Let's try our best to foster
a healthy work environment

928
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,687
based on mutual respect, dear sisters.

929
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,272
Okay?

930
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:37,331
President Shin says he wants to
keep you on as his assistant.

931
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,583
I told him fine.

932
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,418
You can stay on.

933
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,504
Thank you, ma'am.
I'll be sure to work hard.

934
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:44,839
Also,

935
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,383
you live with a Kang Eun-joo
in the dorms, right?

936
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:51,178
Yes, how do you know her?

937
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,138
Kang Eun-joo is…

938
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,892
Chairman Kang Pil-beom's daughter.

939
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,769
She's the late President Kang's
half-sister.

940
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,314
She's our chairman's daughter?

941
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,442
Nora has lived overseas for a long time,

942
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,152
so she has no friends in Korea.

943
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,404
Office life won't be easy on her, either.

944
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,865
Help her get settled into her new life.

945
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,326
And report back weekly

946
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,745
on how she's doing
during the three probationary months.

947
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:17,914
You already know,

948
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,416
all of this stays between you and me.

949
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:21,709
Yes, ma'am.

950
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,253
Thank you for entrusting me
with such a task.

951
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,349
The president wants to keep me on
as his assistant.

952
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:38,517
I knew it.

953
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,062
She makes it sound like
she does all the work.

954
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:41,979
That's what I'm saying.

955
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:51,697
Apologize.

956
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,203
I'm sorry about today.

957
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,915
And about the break room incident too.

958
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,377
Get lost.

959
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,554
What's with them?

960
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,224
I guess they heard you'll be staying on.

961
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:19,892
Already?

962
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:21,936
Anyhow,

963
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,063
thanks.

964
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,400
You said I should ask for help

965
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,860
from the one
the late president was closest to.

966
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,321
I spent all night racking my brain,

967
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,533
wondering if I should visit Mr. So
with a box of expensive ribs.

968
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,285
You mean Mr. So Gyeong-dong
in the Trading Division?

969
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,246
SO GYEONG-DONG
MOST LIKELY TO BE YEHPPEE

970
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,666
Yeah, Mr. So is the well-respected,
seasoned veteran in Hanmin.

971
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,420
Every time President Kang
had a tough decision to make,

972
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,755
he made sure to consult Mr. So.

973
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,675
I see.

974
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:55,636
Did the two of them meet
the day before President Kang died?

975
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,389
The prosecution's investigation had them

976
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,558
meeting and working late
every day for a month.

977
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,936
So Gyeong-dong.

978
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,354
President Kang's mentor

979
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,523
and a well-respected,
seasoned veteran in Hanmin.

980
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,317
The investigation had them
meeting and working late for a month.

981
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,736
He's got to be Yehppee.

982
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:21,328
You know how you asked me
to look into Go Bok-hee?

983
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,329
Yes.

984
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,665
There's something fishy.

985
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,126
About Go Bok-hee?

986
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,254
Take care.

987
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,259
<i>Before rejoining Hanmin,</i>

988
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,554
<i>she hopped around regional second-tier</i>
<i>financial institutions on a yearly basis.</i>

989
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,269
<i>Well, the manager of Saenara Bank in Yeosu</i>

990
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:46,937
<i>reported her to the police…</i>

991
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,273
<i>for larceny.</i>

992
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:52,359
EXPRESS BUS
YEOSU TO SEOUL

993
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,569
- What?
- The next day,

994
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,654
the report was withdrawn.

995
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,783
But it also turned out
that the manager had been embezzling.

996
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,035
And the money disappeared with Go Bok-hee?

997
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,495
It did.

998
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:04,580
Listen,

999
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:07,416
she's a thief
who backstabbed another thief.

1000
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,668
How can you trust her?

1001
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,717
What in the world?

1002
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,124
NEW MAIL FROM YEHPPEE@KEBEO.CO.KR

1003
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,376
- "Yehppee"?
<i>- Yehppee and I</i>

1004
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,838
<i>are getting the ledger together</i>
<i>for whistleblowing purposes.</i>

1005
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,173
<i>Pick it up at the president's office</i>
<i>on the 12th floor</i>

1006
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,591
<i>in Hanmin's head office.</i>

1007
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,511
- Is it not there?
- This can't be.

1008
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,474
Since I know what this is now,

1009
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,018
I'll make another clean score
and disappear.

1010
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,985
<i>Damn, how can I trust an embezzler?</i>

1011
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,654
It means Go Bok-hee is a pro.

1012
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,742
President Kang's agenda.

1013
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,744
They wouldn't have tossed it out already.

1014
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,534
Think, Hong Keum-bo.

1015
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,536
You've been working for ten years.

1016
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,205
You can find this with your eyes closed.

1017
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,296
FRUITS CANDY

1018
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,718
Got it.

1019
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,475
FEBRUARY BUSINESS PLAN

1020
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,315
3RD QUARTER SCHEDULE

1021
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,274
Found it.

1022
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,321
What? Why is it empty?

1023
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,212
Yes, I'm still at my office.

1024
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,631
I'll be right down.

1025
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,817
Why does he work in the dark?

1026
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,153
My poor heart.

1027
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,042
Keum-bo.

1028
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:19,877
Hong Keum-bo.

1029
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:30,637
SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN YU-NA
FOR HER APPEARANCE

1030
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,545
UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

1031
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,006
Hong Jang-mi,
the president is asking for you.

1032
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,844
<i>Do you happen to know</i>
<i>the name of Mr. So's dog?</i>

1033
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,805
So pretty. I mean, Yehppee.

1034
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,849
<i>What's with the perm and highlights?</i>

1035
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,851
<i>Maybe I should try Go Bok-hee again.</i>

1036
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,896
<i>Hong Jang-mi, what's your deal?</i>
<i>What are you digging through?</i>

1037
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:21,814
<i>Oh, I'm not…</i>

1038
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,899
<i>Blending in is barely enough</i>
<i>to get you by right now.</i>

1039
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:26,860
<i>How can you go</i>
<i>and attract even more attention?</i>

1040
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,112
<i>About Ms. Hong…</i>

1041
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,488
I've seen her somewhere before.

1042
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,907
The Financial Supervisory Service
will be here for an investigation today.

1043
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,450
The Financial Supervisory Service?

1044
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:40,124
