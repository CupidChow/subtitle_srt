00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 4

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What's a sports preparation?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Listen, I'll explain it so that even monkeys understand.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When a person tries to move their body,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
their brain decides to move it already.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Huh? What do you mean?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The one with the sense of presence.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well...

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I think I'm punching after thinking about it myself.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But in reality, I punch unconsciously a few seconds before I realize it?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As expected of you, my lady!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're a genius when you understand it so quickly!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A few seconds...

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's time to take my life.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In other words,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
if you can overcome your conscious thoughts

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and be able to take the sports preparation,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's all thanks to you.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I struggled to avoid your noisy thoughts,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
but I've got a deep-seated trick.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you hurt my precious people!

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll finish you off like this!

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, no!

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I can't get used to it all of a sudden.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Damn it!

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're having a lot of fun.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
On my island...

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The one who touched my family...

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll kill him.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who?

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,920
Alright alright, everyone.

94
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
Let's all get

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
everything together.

96
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,560
And wait just a little bit.

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Aren't you hungry?

98
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,000
Aren't you hungry?

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Everyone, action!

100
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Everyone, action!

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
'

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,640
Right now I'm hungry.

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Everyone, action!

104
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,120
Let's all get buscando.

105
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,440
And wait just a little bit.

106
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
And wait just a little bit.

107
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
Perfect...

108
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
Now it's here.

109
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,000
Ô?

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Here?

111
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,440
lance

112
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Here?

113
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,960
剛

114
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,040
chuck

115
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,400
chuck

116
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,840
ative

117
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I'm sorry.

118
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Moisture Etonol?

119
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
That's when it happened?

120
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
So that's why it's in the Water Sword Mode.

121
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
But somehow...

122
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
It feels different from the previous time I was drunk.

123
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,840
You guys are so weird from one to the next.

124
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
The Mafia has been underestimated.

125
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
No way!

126
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Mafia Jogo?

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Shin, it's dangerous, so back off.

128
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Die!

129
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Where are you?

130
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,840
From now on, I'll cut off the number of people you've killed.

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Get out of my way, you piece of shit!

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Who are you trying to...

133
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I told you to shut up.

134
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
That hurts!

135
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
I understand.

136
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Please, forgive me.

137
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I won't get involved with you guys anymore.

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Please.

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Have you ever lent an ear to someone's life?

140
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I'm going to die.

141
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
No, I don't want this to be the last time.

142
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
You're crazy!

143
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
The Bad End is a human's life, so it's no fun.

144
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
No, I want to live longer.

145
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,840
I want to kill more people.

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
You're not listening to me.

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
It's over.

148
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Go, you bastard!

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
I don't care about you.

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
I don't care about you.

151
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I care about you.

152
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,840
I heard the death penalty was killed at the same place.

153
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,840
What if the death penalty is gone?

154
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Why are you making me do this?

155
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Shishiba said he wanted to eat tonkatsu.

156
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
You're the one.

157
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Eat slowly.

158
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
You're not eating.

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Hey!

160
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm approaching the target.

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Can you two move with full stomach?

162
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
If you're sick, you can rest.

163
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
We don't have a choice.

164
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
It's easy, but...

165
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Let's eat and find a place to stay.

166
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Don't be so cool.

167
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
It's not good manners.

168
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Shishiba, I'm leaving.

169
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Thank you for the meal.

170
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Be careful.

171
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
You'll die from being impatient.

172
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
I hate women too much.

173
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
I can't eat two katsu-don.

174
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm full.

175
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
That's impossible.

176
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Why is he...

177
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
I'll eat you up!

178
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Damn it.

179
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I won't die here.

180
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
I don't want to kill you.

181
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Take me to the airport.

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
No, the customer is still...

183
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Shut up. I'll kill you.

184
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Just pray.

185
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Yes!

186
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
The next day

187
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Okay, I'll steal the money and hide for a while.

188
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
You're in a hurry.

189
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Sorry, but your destination is a little later.

190
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
I don't care.

191
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I just arrived.

192
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I'm going to fire.

193
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Hey, Rue. Wake up.

194
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Did you get a heart attack?

195
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
He's not here.

196
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
I have to find him right away.

197
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
What's wrong?

198
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Does your head hurt?

199
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
A new ability has been activated.

200
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Damn it.

201
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
It's a critical time.

202
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
If so, you're dead.

203
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Damn it.

204
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,840
I was rampaging in the general public area.

205
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,840
We're used to being floater.

206
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Floater?

207
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Who?

208
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
When the killer destroys or pollutes the city,

209
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
it recovers itself before the battle.

210
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
It's a self-propelled unit.

211
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
It's a big deal.

212
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
It's a bad pattern.

213
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,840
It's almost like a job for the killer's fairy agency.

214
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Speaking of bad patterns,

215
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
you're completely drunk.

216
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
I was drinking.

217
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
It felt good.

218
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,240
By the way, where's the

219
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,840
shopping bag?

220
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Oh, no.

221
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
I have to go back to the store.

222
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
I like this.

223
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Well,

224
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
what can I ask for?

225
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I hope you can kill the killer.

226
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
It's strange.

227
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Why do humans close their eyes when they pray?

228
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Wow.

229
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
I've met him.

230
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Thank you, God.

231
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Oh,

232
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
you're the best booth in the list.

233
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Do you know how to thank God in Japan?

234
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Huh?

235
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Two bows.

236
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Two claps.

237
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
One bow.

238
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh,

239
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I saw you before.

240
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
I've decided.

241
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,840
I'll make you cuter.

242
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Osaragi.

243
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Where did he go?

244
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
The End

245
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,840
You're the one who's going to make me cuter.

246
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
I'll make you die.

247
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
In the name of the Order,

248
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Harimogura.

249
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
You're a crazy bastard.

250
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,840
I was just in love.

251
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
What's the matter?

252
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,840
You think it's a terrible thing to catch people and kill them?

253
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,840
You're a murderer, too.

254
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Why are you judging me?

255
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Judging?

256
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
No way.

257
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,840
If a bug enters the house, it will kill it.

258
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
That's all.

259
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Murder is my house.

260
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
The Order is...

261
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Well...

262
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
When it grows?

263
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
You know, the one with the sharpness.

264
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Is this a weapon?

265
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
You're a pretty tough guy.

266
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
It's heavy.

267
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
What's wrong?

268
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Hit me like you did before.

269
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Can't you get closer if you don't have the courage?

270
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,840
One on the palm of your hand, six on the body.

271
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Oh, that's how it's stored.

272
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
It's like a magic hand.

273
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
It's weird.

274
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
It's like a bone.

275
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
It's like a hand.

276
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
It's weird.

277
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Is it hidden in the bone?

278
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
What should I do?

279
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I don't want to get too close.

280
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I don't have a version today.

281
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Well, are you going to pray to God?

282
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,840
You taught me how to do it earlier.

283
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
This time, the people...

284
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
It's different.

285
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
It's hot.

286
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,840
The shrine's bell is a punishment.

287
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Punishment?

288
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Punishment doesn't work.

289
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Because God is kind.

290
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
The one who is kind...

291
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Suekichi.

292
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,840
It's always been strange.

293
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,840
If I were God, I wouldn't make a person like you.

294
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Be more afraid, Busu.

295
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
You're too kind.

296
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
So...

297
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,840
We'll keep the order in place.

298
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,840
I don't need prayers for a dirty murderer.

299
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,840
My love has always been one-sided.

300
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
I love you.

301
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Is it a sin to be one-sided?

302
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I love you.

303
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Please go out with me.

304
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Okay.

305
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
I love you, too.

306
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I want you to love me more than anyone else.

307
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
I love you, Damp.

308
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
We're best friends, right?

309
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
I love you.

310
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,840
That's when fear is the best.

311
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
While everyone's afraid,

312
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,840
they think of me without lying.

313
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Huh?

314
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,840
But why am I so empty?

315
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,840
If I die, they won't think of anything else.

316
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840
It's hard to break up.

317
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,840
I have to find my next lover.

318
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Why am I the only one who's fallen in love with someone else?

319
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Just like everyone else!

320
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Just like everyone else?

321
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,840
I just want to be loved!

322
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,840
We're murderers.

323
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,840
But because there's someone like you...

324
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,840
I have a reason to live today.

325
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Thank you.

326
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,840
I love you.

327
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Beautiful.

328
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Hey, Taro.

329
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
It's been a while since I last saw you, Shikeshu.

330
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Oh, it's okay.

331
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,840
I can't keep quiet when I'm beaten up.

332
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I'll call you again when I find you.

333
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,840
I think I'll find these weirdos soon.

334
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,840
But this is the view of the peace family!

335
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,840
You're always flying to the great places, peace family!

336
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,840
You're so cool, peace family!

337
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Okay, now I'm in super peace family mode!

338
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Where are you going, Shikeshu?

339
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Yes, I'm going to the Shikeshu family.

340
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
They're already dead.

341
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,840
But it's almost as planned.

342
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Yes.

343
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
We were able to get the order right.

344
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,840
We're going to the next phase.

345
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Yes.

346
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Then let's continue.

347
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,840
For the sake of justice.

348
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Who are you calling?

349
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,840
What's your purpose?

350
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,840
This is the apartment of the Shikeshu family.

351
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
What are you talking about?

352
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Oh, you've been deceived.

353
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
I want to die.

354
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,840
You don't try to understand me either.

355
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
People can't understand each other forever

356
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,840
unless they reveal the contents.

357
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,840
I'm grateful that you got me out of prison,

358
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,840
but I'm sorry to be used by you guys.

359
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,840
I'm going to live my life the way I've lived.

360
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
You too!

361
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Don't touch anyone other than Rist!

362
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
It's not a deal!

363
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,840
I want to understand more and more people.

364
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
What's going on?

365
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
I was being naive.

366
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
He's too dangerous.

367
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,840
If we don't do something, our plan will be ruined.

368
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
Well, it's fine, Kashima.

369
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Let him do what he wants.

370
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,840
This is a difficult question.

371
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
No, it's fine.

372
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Let's enjoy the risk.

373
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Let's kill him.

374
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
It's fine.

375
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Let's enjoy the risk.

376
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,840
This is just right to get rid of the murder.

377
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Let's make them go wild.

378
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Is Shin okay?

379
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Oh, thank goodness.

380
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm fine.

381
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,840
There are no customers yet.

382
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Yeah, I'm fine by myself.

383
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
You too, Kir-

384
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Sorry.

385
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,840
I'll hang up now that the customers are here.

386
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Welcome.

387
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Are you looking for something?

388
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

393
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm sorry.

396
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,840
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
I'm sorry.

405
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
I'm sorry.

407
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,840
The ideal shadow

417
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,840
I want to see it until it's all gone

418
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Our dreams are unchanged

419
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Our taste

420
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Dad, do your best!

421
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Don't fall!

422
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Dad!

423
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Dad!

424
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
That's my jersey!

425
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I'm going to play a prank on you.

426
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
I wonder if you'll kill me.

427
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
It's okay.

428
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
It's too easy for the manager to just replace it.

429
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Just like that!

430
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Masugas!

431
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Sakamoto!

432
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
He's pretty excited.

433
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Wirings

434
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Oh my god!

435
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Mom!

436
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Thank you!

437
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

438
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

439
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

440
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

441
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

442
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

443
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

444
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

445
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

446
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

447
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

448
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

449
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

450
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
