00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 4

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
I'm so tired...

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,360
If you don't attack me once every 10 seconds,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,360
I'll kill you, boy.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,800
I thought it was over when he said that,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,400
but Rue's a bit...

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,680
Lucky.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,400
But I'm begging you, so do it seriously!

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,640
Here's your pay!

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,160
I guess this is how it is.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,920
Well, it's more than I thought.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,840
You're kidding?

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,600
C, you just said, Rue!

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
This time, it's a laugh?

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,880
Here!

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,760
Nice!

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,600
Come on, try to kill me more!

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,680
No, I won't kill you.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
Because that's my family name.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,040
Rue...

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,360
Kakuun?

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,280
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,680
Kakuun means family.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,000
Shin, the manager, Aoi-san, and Hana-chan...

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,920
They're all my precious family.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,160
Huh?

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,600
Sakamoto has three families?

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,840
You're an idiot!

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Idiot?

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,320
I learned how to shoot a rally in Japan right away.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,400
Hana-chan's got a lot of work to do.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
And yet...

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,960
Huh?

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,840
You idiot!

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,640
This time, it's a fight?

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,640
What's with this power?

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Huh?

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,880
Huh? What was he doing?

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,440
Who's this guy?

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,840
Oh, Shin.

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,360
What are you doing?

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,960
Where am I?

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
He's awake!

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,600
You're trying to stop me?

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
You've got guts.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,560
I've been chased this far.

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,440
Oh no!

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,640
Since when?

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,920
I love strong guys!

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,880
You're the best!

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,920
Huh?

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,840
You're safe?

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,640
Now!

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,080
Accelerate until you turn red

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,080
That's not enough, it's still not enough

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
You're surely standing on your own

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,440
Even if you turn red, drink up your tears

58
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,120
Don't mind it anymore, just look at it

59
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,600
Jump out and run, Sakamoto Raze

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
10 grams of potassium carbonate.

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,360
4.8 grams of sodium bicarbonate.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
20 grams of B3.

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,960
3.5 grams of nitro GK.

64
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,560
I remember now, Moel.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,760
From here on, I'll take it seriously.

66
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,760
I don't know what trick you're playing,

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,080
but what's the difference between being a little thinner and being a little more?

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Well, if you're going to do it, you'd better hurry.

69
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,800
Your family's in trouble right now.

70
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,520
Don't worry.

71
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,440
I have someone I can trust right now.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,040
So what?

73
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
So fast.

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Sakamoto Raze

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Sakamoto, Sakamoto, Sakamoto

76
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,440
Is this the strongest killer, Sakamoto?

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
Why?

78
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Why are you so strong even after you quit this job?

79
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,120
You're strong, Moel.

80
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,280
I used to use my power to hurt people.

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,080
But now...

82
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,080
I've decided to use it to protect my loved ones.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,920
That's...

84
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,920
That's my strength right now, Moel.

85
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
What a beautiful night view.

86
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Yeah, it's beautiful.

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,920
But you're more...

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Satoshi.

89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
What?

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Sakamoto Raze

91
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Sakamoto, you're the best.

92
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
You're the best, Hardboiled.

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Hey, Shin.

94
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Aoi.

95
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
I thought you were at the haunted house.

96
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
What's wrong?

97
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,920
You're all tired, aren't you?

98
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
You were pretty excited.

99
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
You're pretty dirty.

100
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,920
No, I'm pretty tough.

101
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Tough?

102
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Where's Taro?

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I'll go look for him.

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Okay, be careful on your feet.

105
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Are you okay? What happened?

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Hey, miss.

107
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Yes?

108
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,920
It's a bit of a shame to ask a man about his injuries.

109
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,920
No, just give me a normal compensation.

110
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm all out, Sakamoto.

111
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
I'm going to leave you to it.

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,920
But from now on...

113
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Five meat buns, right?

114
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,920
You're a good listener.

115
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
It looks good.

116
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Give me one.

117
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,920
You're a good eater.

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Now for the rest of the family.

119
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Satoshi, you're the family.

120
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Mr. Sakamoto!

121
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
You're so skinny!

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Why? Why?

123
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
People get thinner when they move.

124
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
No, I'm too skinny!

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
But you look like you used to be!

126
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,920
By the way, what about the money?

127
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,920
The Don Denkai will keep after you.

128
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
That's...

129
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Money?

130
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
What do you mean?

131
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Why me?

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Hana, let's play over there.

133
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I want to eat two wata-ane!

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
What a good girl.

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
She's getting stronger.

136
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
So?

137
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,920
The money was spent on the test.

138
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,920
The killer is attacking us.

139
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Kyoto, too.

140
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Why did you keep quiet about something so important?

141
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Men are clumsy creatures.

142
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Madam, I want you to enjoy the amusement park...

143
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,920
...without seeing anything.

144
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,920
It's hardboiled.

145
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Who are you?

146
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
My name is Boil.

147
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
I'm a professional killer!

148
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Can you stop killing your master?

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Yes.

150
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Did you think you could get away with it?

151
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,920
No, but I didn't want to worry.

152
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Did you forget?

153
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Sakamoto family's rule.

154
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Don't do anything you don't know.

155
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,920
If you're going to do something, clean up the mess!

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Okay, that's it.

157
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,920
The parade is about to start.

158
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,920
It's hardboiled.

159
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
But Sakamoto, what should we do to get the money?

160
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,920
I'll destroy the client and get my money back.

161
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
That's reckless.

162
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
The killer is in charge of the check.

163
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
I don't know who did it.

164
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Well, my boss is good at killing.

165
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Then ask the boss of the Don Denkai.

166
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I don't have to do that.

167
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I don't know where the boss is.

168
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
You can't use it.

169
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
You're relying on people too much!

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Then we're going.

171
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
See you, Sakamoto.

172
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
See you.

173
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Take care of Lou.

174
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
So what should we do?

175
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,920
I didn't know where the Don Denkai was.

176
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
There's one thing.

177
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
What's wrong?

178
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Are you hungry?

179
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Sakamoto.

180
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
I rebounded in a day.

181
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Oh, if you eat that much, you won't go back to the original.

182
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I'm hungry.

183
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Here.

184
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Well, there's a place to stand.

185
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
What's this?

186
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
It's a B class.

187
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,920
What is this place?

188
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Information shop.

189
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
They sell all kinds of information in movies.

190
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Why do they sell it in a movie?

191
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Let's go.

192
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
There's a dead body.

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Don Denkai, a killer organization that has more than 50 people.

194
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,920
This story begins with a killer.

195
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
It's a nice building.

196
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Let's make this place a real giant.

197
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
This is the headquarters.

198
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Don't die!

199
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Don't make a loud voice.

200
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Damn it.

201
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
What happened?

202
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I didn't expect there to be such a Don Denkai.

203
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
As expected of Director Kanaguri.

204
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
The bill is 756,000 yen.

205
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Expensive?

206
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
With a card.

207
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Yes.

208
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Is the money okay?

209
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
There's a savings from the era of loneliness.

210
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Are you going back to this world, Sakamoto?

211
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
You should be careful.

212
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,920
It may be that you have old friends.

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
What do you mean?

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Unfortunately, the movie of this sword is not in the movie.

215
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,920
This is where I can answer.

216
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,920
I heard you met Sakamoto.

218
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Sakamoto?

219
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
I miss him.

220
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
How are you?

221
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,920
What are you doing?

222
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
I'll kill you.

223
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
It's okay now.

224
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
The boss will be here soon.

225
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
It doesn't matter.

226
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,920
I don't trust this guy.

227
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
It's dangerous.

228
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Let's keep the big knife in the main dish.

229
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
There's a lot of blood.

230
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
What do you think?

231
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Shishiba-san, I don't think you should eat that.

232
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Chef.

233
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Yes.

234
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Why did you spit on the risotto?

235
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Everyone.

236
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Thank you for coming today.

237
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,920
I'm Ilya from the KOROSHIA Association.

238
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,920
I'm the general of the order, Sousou Taro Kaobure.

239
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
It's not everyone.

240
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Where are the other four?

241
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Those three are as usual.

242
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,920
It's rare to see you.

243
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Are you busy?

244
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
No, I'm just taking care of it.

245
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
What a pity.

246
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Recently, the KOROSHIA Association has been killed by someone.

247
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,920
I want you to take care of it as soon as possible.

248
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Under the name of the order.

249
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,920
This is the main dish.

250
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
I want to fight as much as possible.

251
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
It's a sneaking mission.

252
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Did you hear about Sakamoto?

253
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920
He's a great student.

254
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Boil-san was killed.

255
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Really?

256
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
That Boil-san.

257
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
I'm not afraid of God.

258
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm not afraid of the boss.

259
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Successfully infiltrated.

260
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Do you take off the clothes?

261
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm tired of it.

262
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Where is the boss?

263
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
You didn't watch the movie.

264
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
It was expensive.

265
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,920
The boss's room is on the first floor.

266
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
You can go through the window from the second floor.

267
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
The movie was like that.

268
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Hey, Mr. Sakamoto.

269
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I was sleeping.

270
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Is it blue?

271
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
It's fun to be a spy.

272
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,920
It's not a game.

273
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
It's strange.

274
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,920
I can't hear the enemy's voice on this floor.

275
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
It's a useful detector.

276
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
I can hear your heart.

277
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm here.

278
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Hey, Mr. Sakamoto.

279
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Nagumo.

280
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
You saw me.

281
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Why are you here?

282
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:44,920
All the bosses of the Don Denkai, including the upper class, were killed by me.

283
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Sakamoto.

284
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,920
I'm sorry, but you'll die too.

285
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
It's fast.

286
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm kidding.

287
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
You were surprised.

288
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
I had something to do.

290
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
When I arrived, I was already in a state of destruction.

291
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Say that from the beginning.

292
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
You're a bad guy.

293
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
What do you want?

294
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
I'm looking into it.

295
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Killing killers are being done frequently these days.

296
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
It's not unusual.

297
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Of course, it's common for killers to have a little bit of a fight.

298
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:47,920
More than 100 killers of the organization involved in the murder are being killed in the past few months.

299
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
It's a message to kill clearly.

300
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
More than 100 people?

301
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
One fourth of professional killers?

302
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,920
We always leave a punishment mark on the spot.

303
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
We call it Sura.

304
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
We?

305
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Is the order moving?

306
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Yes.

307
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,920
That silver-haired man said it too.

308
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
What's the order?

309
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Special Forces of the Murderous Company.

310
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,920
The highest power of the killer world.

311
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:23,920
The mission of the killer who is highly dangerous, which the killer has selected, is to maintain order in the killer world.

312
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
By the way, Sakamoto-kun is also an ex-order.

313
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I didn't know.

314
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Anyway, Sakamoto-kun, you guys should be careful with Sura.

315
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
We're not killers anymore.

316
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
That's not relevant.

317
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
That's right.

318
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,920
We're busy with the verification money.

319
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I don't know much about it, but I can say one thing.

320
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,920
The killing and murder began, and Sakamoto-kun was paid to verify it.

321
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
It's the same time.

322
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,920
When you look at things with both eyes, you will unconsciously be exposed to the influence of the angle.

323
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Let's check if the illustrations you drew are symmetrical.

324
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Hmm.

325
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,920
The balance is a little bad.

326
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,920
But in the end, it's a swing.

327
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Sakamoto-kun is here again.

328
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
It's a strong one.

329
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Here?

330
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
No.

331
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
That corner.

332
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I'm in trouble if the killer comes in this way.

333
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,920
It's hard to get the verification money.

334
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,920
But it's okay because the bandages and bandages are selling well these days.

335
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Is that okay?

336
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
I'll put bandages on you.

337
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Thank you, young lady.

338
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Papa is strong.

339
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Sakamoto-kun, if you're going to be a boil, it's really bad.

340
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,920
The five-year blank was bigger than I expected.

341
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Since we don't know the enemy, what we can do now is to become strong so that we can be attacked anytime.

342
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
In other words, it's a rehabilitation.

343
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
So fast.

344
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Welcome.

345
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
This is it.

346
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
It's gross.

347
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,920
My training is to drink a lot.

348
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
I'll have a meat bun.

349
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
No.

350
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Ruu-chan.

351
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Why did you find out?

352
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,920
The customer is kissing Kuriosha from the back.

353
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Ruu-chan.

354
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
