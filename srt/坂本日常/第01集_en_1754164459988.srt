They're here! Curtain the tank!

...Jackman is dependent on שנcaliger 2, though he wants to have more serve.

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:57,520
Both setting the play while holding ngojutsu at sides is something you can get byantically ragequiting to all players sides.

The Last of Us

14
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
He was feared by all evil fighters.

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
He was the dream of all killers.

16
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
But one day...

17
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Welcome!

18
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
He fell in love.

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
He retired.

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
He got married.

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
He got married.

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
And...

23
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Sakamoto got fat.

24
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
The Last of Us

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,640
He was a fighter.

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,640
He was a fighter.

27
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,640
He was a fighter.

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,640
He was a fighter.

29
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
He was a fighter.

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
He was a fighter.

31
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,640
He was a fighter.

32
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Totalgov

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
The Last of Us

34
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
To be continued

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,140
There's no mistake.

36
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,140
I've been looking for you, Sakamoto-san.

37
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Manager, look!

38
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,640
If you hit this mat, you'll get a free juice!

39
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,140
Oh, come on.

40
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,140
That girl's been coming a lot lately.

41
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Yeah.

42
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,640
I missed it!

43
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,640
One more time! Manager, look again!

44
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,640
Oh, no.

45
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,140
You little bitch!

46
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,640
You're going to steal my white stuff!

47
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,140
What are you going to do?

48
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Let go of me!

49
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,140
I'll kill you!

50
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,640
You're a real nerd.

51
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Manager, thank you.

52
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
There, there. Don't cry.

53
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
There, there.

54
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,640
As expected.

55
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,140
With a ballpoint pen, I cut a line from the chin.

56
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I saw it.

57
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,640
It's been a while, Sakamoto-san.

58
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
This is the true face of an Esper.

59
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,140
Why did you kill me so quickly?

60
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
It's me!

61
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,140
I used to be your subordinate!

62
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
So it was true.

63
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,140
Rumor has it that you quit the killer and went to a private store.

64
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Please come back, Sakamoto-san.

65
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,140
It's a waste.

66
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
You've become so weak.

67
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
I won't go back to the killer.

68
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,140
You once were feared by all villains.

69
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,640
You were called the legendary killer.

70
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,140
And now...

71
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Why is this happening?

72
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Shhh...

73
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Delicious.

74
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,140
I used to only eat rations.

75
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,140
To be honest, you don't even look at me now.

76
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,140
It's fast.

77
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,640
It's a message that you can kill me anytime, even if I get fat.

78
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Hey, Sakamoto-san.

79
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm sorry for eating something good, but I have a favor to ask.

80
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
You're asking Sakamoto-san for a favor?

81
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Could it be that he's asking for a killer based on his popularity?

82
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,640
That tree...

83
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
It's too high to cut through.

84
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,140
Sakamoto-san, I'm counting on you.

85
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,640
Oh, that's good.

86
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
As expected.

87
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Sakamoto-san, your daughter doesn't eat vegetables.

88
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Aichi!

89
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
There's only one ball!

90
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Wow! Thank you!

91
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,640
You're also playing the convenient store in the city?

92
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I see.

93
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,640
You're hiding your true identity and getting into the city.

94
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,640
But, Sakamoto-san...

95
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,640
From what I see, you're...

96
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
You're really a coward.

97
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I'll come again.

98
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
You little brat!

99
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
It's been five years since we last met, Sakamoto-san.

100
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,140
It's gotten so round...

101
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,140
But...

102
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,140
Sakamoto-san is so cool!

103
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,140
Even if he's fat, he's got a different aura!

104
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,140
Let's work together again!

105
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
Don't look!

106
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Yes?

107
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Did you convince him?

108
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
No, that's...

109
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
Then...

110
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Did you kill him?

111
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,140
Boss...

112
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,140
Do I have to do it?

113
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,140
Sakamoto-san is so fat right now, so it's not a problem if I leave him alone.

114
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,140
Shin.

115
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,140
The one who leaves the organization will be killed.

116
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Sakamoto broke the rules.

117
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
So he can't be alive.

118
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,140
And, Shin...

119
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,140
Even if you don't do it, there are many alternatives!

120
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,640
I'll kill you too if you keep on talking!

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Shut up.

122
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,640
I guess I have to do it.

123
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,940
The

124
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,640
Even if I don't do it, someone else will.

125
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Then, I'll just...

126
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
I'll do it...

127
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
With my own hands.

128
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Hey, hey.

129
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,140
What kind of poop is this?

130
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,140
It's so clean!

131
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Huh?

132
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,140
It's the one from yesterday, Shin-kun.

133
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,140
Did you come again?

134
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
Look!

135
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,140
This is an alien poop!

136
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Sorry, Kitsu.

137
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,140
It's time for war.

138
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Hello, Sakamoto-san.

139
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Actually, I'm leaving this town today.

140
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,140
Before that, I'd like to greet you.

141
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,140
I don't think so!

142
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
It's starting up in the rain!

143
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
It's raining!

144
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,640
It's no good! I can't read the thoughts!

145
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Where is it?

146
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
It's a shit!

147
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
I'll take care of it!

148
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Shit!

149
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,640
What the hell...

150
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
The End

151
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
It's almost time for dinner.

152
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Help me out.

153
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Okay.

154
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Oh, I woke up!

155
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Oh my.

156
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Thank goodness.

157
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
This is...

158
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
The second floor of the shopping mall.

159
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
If you'd like, you can eat.

160
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Huh? Um...

161
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,640
Rice?

162
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Special?

163
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Mega?

164
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,640
Normal...

165
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Thank you for the food!

166
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,140
Why did I do this?

167
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
I'm on a mission...

168
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,140
It's poison!

169
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,140
If it's poison, I'm going to die.

170
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Delicious!

171
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,140
I love you!

172
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,140
It's the same reaction as before.

173
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
It's the same reaction as before.

174
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,140
What?

175
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
What is this feeling?

176
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,140
I've never tasted this before in my life.

177
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,140
I see!

178
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:09,140
Sakamoto-san is going to kill each other to protect this ordinary life.

179
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,140
I'm going to kill him.

180
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Sakamoto-san, I...

181
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Thank you for the food.

182
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
I'm going to kill him.

183
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Sakamoto-san is really something.

184
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,640
What are you talking about, Shin?

185
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
How pathetic.

186
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,640
You didn't kill Sakamoto, did you?

187
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Boss...

188
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
What?

189
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
I don't want to hear excuses.

190
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Can you let Sakamoto-san go?

191
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Sakamoto-san is so annoying!

192
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Why?

193
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Why are you protecting Sakamoto?

194
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,640
He has a place to go.

195
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Sakamoto broke the rules of this world.

196
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
He abandoned his responsibility.

197
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,140
That's why he's going to kill him.

198
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,140
If it's my responsibility, I'm going to die instead.

199
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Please let Sakamoto-san go.

200
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Why are you doing this?

201
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,140
I've given my loyalty to someone I admire.

202
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,140
It's my own punishment.

203
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Fine.

204
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,640
If you die, I'll let you live.

205
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
How stupid.

206
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
You're not stupid.

207
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Go to hell.

208
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
I heard it.

209
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
I thought it was going to be like that.

210
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Kill him!

211
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
I have no choice.

212
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
I can finally save you.

213
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Take this.

214
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
I'll do it.

215
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
It's not your fault.

218
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
It's not my fault.

219
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
It's not my fault.

220
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
It's not my fault.

221
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,520
The

226
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
first

227
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
one

228
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
is

229
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
the

230
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
second

231
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
one

232
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
is

233
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
the

234
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
third

235
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
one

236
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
is

237
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
the

238
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
third

239
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
is

240
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
the

241
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
third

242
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
is

243
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
the

244
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
third

245
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
is

246
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
the

247
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
third

248
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
is

249
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
the

250
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,060
That was confusing.

251
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,900
Now's my chance.

252
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
The only way is to defeat the curse!

253
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,860
Against the solar system.

254
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

255
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
It's over now.

256
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
Sakamoto-san.

257
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Sakamoto?

258
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Kill him!

259
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Die!

260
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
I'm gonna get you, so don't stop me

261
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
You're gonna be my friend

262
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Just can't let that go

263
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Ready, it's love, we're gonna win for the love

264
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Come on, I'm gonna make you feel the thrill

265
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
I'm gonna make you feel the thrill

266
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,860
Always there for the good

267
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Any kind of good

268
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
We're gonna win this way

269
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Like a rock on a rock

270
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Always there for the good

271
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,860
Any kind of good

272
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
We're gonna win this way

273
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
Huh?

274
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
A-An emergency?

275
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
It can't be...

276
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:23,860
A

277
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,860
Eplon?

278
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
800 yen per hour

279
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
No more work for you

280
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
A-Ri

281
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,860
What?

282
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Sakamoto-san

283
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Can you stop eating ramen next to me?

284
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,860
This shirt is new

285
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,860
I don't even have any ramen stock left

286
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
I'm home

287
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Oh my, you look great

288
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
Really?

289
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
It's on the table

290
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Grandma, here

291
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Oh, you know what to do

292
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
I was looking for this

293
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
Thank you

294
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
As expected of Espar

295
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
Let's play

296
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
After work

297
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Is that fun?

298
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
I don't know yet

299
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,860
But it's better than before

300
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
What was your job before?

301
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
I'll kill you if you talk

302
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,860
Well, I guess I'm like a cleaner

303
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
In society

304
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
A-Ri

305
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
What are you doing?

306
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
I'm going to sleep

307
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm going to sleep

308
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
I'm going to sleep

309
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,860
It's not normal

310
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,860
You laugh at being normal

311
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,860
I want to tell you with the most lovely words

312
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,860
No, just smile next to me

313
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Just like this, I want to sneak out somewhere

314
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,860
And try to take you away

315
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I'm fine, because you're by my side

316
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,860
The southern wind is blowing, and the wind is touching my cheeks

317
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,860
These days when our feelings overlap

318
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,860
I want to hold you tight, I want to keep you from letting go

319
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,860
Even though we're not in love

320
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,860
The days when we laugh together

321
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,860
I wish I could say the words I love

322
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,860
No, just smile next to me

323
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Just smile next to me
