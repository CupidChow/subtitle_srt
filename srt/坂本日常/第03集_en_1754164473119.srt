00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're late!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You're so meticulous.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You're so close...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Two hours is not a little!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey, Ruru!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Put the detergent in the fridge!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're such a meticulous man.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Even if it's just a little, the customers will choose on their own.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's a limit to just a little!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You've never worked before, have you?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm helping out with my dad's job.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I dug a big hole and filled it with mysterious morning dew.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Sakamoto-san, let's kill that woman!

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
She doesn't suit our peaceful atmosphere!

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This store doesn't have that kind of atmosphere, Hanakara.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Shut up!

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going to save her!

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey, Shin.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You shouldn't say that to people.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ruru, you should apologize properly when you're late.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sakamoto-san?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's wrong, you two?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You look like you've been hit by a 22 Long Rifle bullet.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come on, let's get ready for the morning.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Shin, do the cleaning outside.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ruru, did you finish preparing the meat buns?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The manager doesn't talk much.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've been with him for years, and I've never seen him talk like this.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He's so cold-hearted.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do you think you're the kind of people who don't like me talking?

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How rude.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll kill you.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm a bloodthirsty human being, too.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you for everything, you two.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Me?

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I've never been a different character before I started talking.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sakamoto-san is...

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Two?!

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't mind me.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Look at me.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Jump out!

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
With your feet, Sakamoto Reis!

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That was a surprise.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I guess it's a doppelganger.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's been a while, Ragumon.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're still moving, Sakamoto.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm relieved.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In an instant, his face...

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And he couldn't read his mind?

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Poof.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I didn't expect you to fool me that well.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sakamoto!

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who is this guy?

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I won't let you get away with this!

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm Nagumo.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm a clerk at Mukai No Super.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm Sakamoto's friend.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
By the way, I'm 18 years old.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Friend?

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're young!

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There's no supermarket in Mukai.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm 27 years old and I'm a killer.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're almost lying!

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're not lying!

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sakamoto has been fined $1 million.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The sum is $1 million.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're lying again.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
$1 million is a lie.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Even elementary school students don't say that.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, it's true.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The other day, the Killer Alliance officially decided.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's tomorrow that we're going to the website.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hello.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Pizza delivery.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Here it comes.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I've been waiting for you.

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's already been rumored among the killer's who are quick to listen.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That legendary killer has been revived.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Then it will be $2,940.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, my.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What a peaceful and peaceful life.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you put this pizza Nakajima in there,

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you'll be living on a plate.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't move.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You'll ruin your face.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sakamoto, you're not eating pizza.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll kill you.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You bastard!

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You were right.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I hate lies.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How dare you!

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Nagumo, wait.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you going to keep on killing?

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you going to keep on fighting against the killer?

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why, us?

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, no.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not going to participate this time.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We're experts in anti-killer.

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, you know what I mean.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I miss the time I spent with you.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Nagumo.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Who's going to take the blame for my death?

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't know.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We're just following orders we've received.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're too obvious to retire.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You've done too much to destroy the boy group.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you stupid?

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Those guys are attacking us again.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No way.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They're not coming back.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, for now.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm glad I met you, Sakamoto.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I wanted to see your face before I died.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wait, not yet!

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is he on my side?

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Should I go back to the country?

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hey, hey.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're going to get beaten up, pizza guy.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But you're so good-looking.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I bet that black-haired guy is more dangerous.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's fine.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But you're too old-fashioned.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sorry, I was being too obvious.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm starting to want to eat pizza.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You guys are underestimating Sakamoto.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're always behind him.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Time, place.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Choose the most difficult time for him.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's the most important thing.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He used to be an order guy.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you're not good enough, you'll meet him on the way home.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Order, huh?

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a city legend.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's been five years since I retired.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's no problem with that.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll give you a piece of advice.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If you keep following him,

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you'll end up in hell.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Did he notice the camera?

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He's making a big impression.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's go to the arcade.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sure.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What Nagumo said is true.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He's going to attack us like a pizza guy.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It can't be helped.

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Since we don't know the enemy's situation,

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
we can't just walk around.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Dad!

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hana!

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm ready!

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ready?

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What's that outfit?

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's for Sugar.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've been looking forward to it.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sugar?

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I have to wake up early tomorrow and make lunch.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hana!

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I love the rabbit and the apple!

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Where are you going?

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I forgot!

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to the arcade.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll see you later.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The End

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The Viking was fun!

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hey, that was too exciting.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I ate too much of the Frankfurt.

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll be leaving now.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're so big.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're so big.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look, Ryo-chan.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is the Hiloin.

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The Tokyo Dome.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What's the Tokyo Dome?

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And the mascot is so cute.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a strong and fat rabbit.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's called Sugar.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
She's like a manager.

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's been a while since I went out.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's have fun today.

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I found a check.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The sum is ten billion.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You guys are good.

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hurry up.

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hurry up!

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Boo,

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll make sure of it.

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Our task for today is to guard the devil.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Then Mr. Sakamoto and the others will enjoy the holidays.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,760
But with so many people, I can't tell who the enemy is.

234
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,960
Don't be so cocky. There's no enemy nearby.

235
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,680
How do you know?

236
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,960
If you set the conditions,

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,920
I can read people's minds up to 30 meters from the target.

238
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,340
People who want to kill people are usually full of emotions.

239
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,720
I see.

240
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,340
You're always peeping into my mind?

241
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,800
You pervert!

242
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,220
Shut up! That's not true!

243
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,140
You have to concentrate.

244
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,760
It's like you're trying to match the radio channel.

245
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,140
Why does he have that kind of ability?

246
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,480
Sugamoto, the enemy is getting closer!

247
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,140
Roger.

248
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,520
The west direction?

249
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,980
I guess I was underestimated by my family and my trip.

250
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,660
Hana, what's that?

251
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,180
I'll destroy you,

252
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,020
you feeling-good?

253
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,780
That was a multiple kill?

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,160
What?

255
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,440
Was that just sound...?

256
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,960
What a ridiculous man.

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,500
I hate it...

258
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
He's a man of no value, Manager.

259
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
He's not even a little bit of an enemy.

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Not only that.

261
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:50,100
He's avoiding the organs and the

262
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,100
That Amachan appeal is really the former legendary killer.

263
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,100
And that Shin-kun is a nuisance.

264
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
He can read people's thoughts.

265
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Huh?

266
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Then I don't have to appeal anything.

267
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Oh, it's decided.

268
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:19,100
What are you doing?

269
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
The manager and the others are going.

270
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Oh.

271
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Children get lost like that.

272
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Wow, I'm looking forward to it.

273
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm so excited.

274
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
It's painful.

275
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Please do not remove the safety lever while driving.

276
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Have a comfortable trip.

277
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Why is it in the back seat?

278
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
It's easy to find the enemy.

279
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,100
And the back seat is the fastest.

280
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,100
The speed is the same.

281
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,100
What about the hot enemy?

282
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
It seems that there is no one who thinks of strange things.

283
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,100
The enemy is coming to this place.

284
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,100
The silver-haired man in front of me is suspicious.

285
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Is that so?

286
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
But the thought is ...

287
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
Obviously, it's not a good look.

288
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Hey, don't decide by looking.

289
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
I was noticed.

290
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Did I appeal?

291
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Oh, my God.

292
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
What are you doing?

293
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Take it off.

294
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Take it off?

295
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Sakamoto, I forgive the enemy's invasion.

296
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,100
The third enemy is the silver-haired man.

297
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Oh, no.

298
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
It's a bulletproof glasses.

299
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,100
It's not a good look.

300
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Sakamoto, I'll do it.

301
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
What are you thinking?

302
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm going to go ahead.

303
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
It's a bulletproof glasses.

304
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,100
It's a bulletproof glasses.

305
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,100
It's a bulletproof glasses.

306
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,100
It's a bulletproof glasses.

307
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
What?

308
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
What?

309
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Let me go.

310
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Let me go.

311
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,100
I'll take it off.

312
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
I'll take it off.

313
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
I'll take it off.

314
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
I'll take it off.

315
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
It's dangerous.

316
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
You are very reckless.

317
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
I thought you'd kill me.

318
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Sakamoto is off today.

319
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,100
I will be on duty instead.

320
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,100
What is that look?

321
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I can't read my mind.

322
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
It's hard to do.

323
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
You've been found out.

324
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
I won't let you!

325
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Damn!

326
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
A Poisonous user?

327
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
That's a good one.

328
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,100
I'm a special blend.

329
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
You're probably going to die soon, but how do you feel?

330
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Shut up, you idiot!

331
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
What are you thinking?

332
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I knew it.

333
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
I thought about it when I saw Sakamoto earlier.

334
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
He's a loser.

335
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
He's afraid of dying.

336
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
What?

337
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Don't be ridiculous.

338
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,100
People who are not ready to die can tell by their eyes.

339
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
You know what?

340
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Humans are weak to the point of being addicted to life.

341
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
I know.

342
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,100
The feeling of not wanting to die makes you make a quick decision.

343
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
You too.

344
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,100
That's why I was so scared of the knife that I couldn't avoid it.

345
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
You don't know anything.

346
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Sakamoto is afraid of death.

347
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Of course.

348
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Sakamoto will protect his family for the rest of his life.

349
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,100
He's in the middle of a super difficult mission.

350
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
The one who can protect them...

351
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
...is the one who fights desperately for life!

352
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
You can't see anything, can you?

353
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,100
You're so annoying.

354
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
It doesn't matter if I can't see anything.

355
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
There's only one way.

356
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
You're a good boy.

357
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
He jumps low.

358
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Nice. It's interesting.

360
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
What are you going to do?

361
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
I don't know!

362
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Damn it!

363
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Professor, are you okay?

364
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm fine.

365
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Chigau, are you okay?

366
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
I'm fine.

367
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Popcorn is delicious.

368
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Everyone's in trouble!

369
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Tsubasa is being attacked!

370
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Let's use everyone's power!

371
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
I didn't expect this to happen.

372
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
What are you doing?

373
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
You're in the middle of a mission!

374
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Shut up. I'm going to kill you.

375
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
Chigau?

376
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
This place is a good place.

377
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Round 2.

378
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
I'll beat you up.

379
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
What are you talking about?

380
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
You're not well.

381
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
You're going to show me your killer skills in front of your kids.

382
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Sugar's rabbit punch!

383
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Why?

384
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Everyone, cheer for Sugar!

385
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
Rabbit right punch!

386
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
What's this move?

387
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Can you see it?

388
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
It's very powerful.

389
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,100
You're surprisingly full-fledged.

390
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Look.

391
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Dad is very serious.

392
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
I can't throw anymore.

393
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Right, right, left, left, right, right counter, jab.

394
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Right counter, jab.

395
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
It's okay.

396
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Guard up.

397
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Body, close.

398
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,100
From the left counter, close the body.

399
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
What's going on?

400
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
I can't read this fast.

401
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,100
And this guy doesn't just look at it.

402
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
He's reading my movements.

403
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
What?

404
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
You suddenly appeal.

405
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
You're too much.

406
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Close your eyes.

407
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
It's over.

408
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
It's over.

409
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,100
One-shot dynamite rabbit shock!

410
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Sugar! Sugar! Sugar!

411
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Nice.

412
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Good night.

413
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I want to sneak out of here and take you with me.

414
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,100
I'm okay.

415
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Because you'll be by my side.

416
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,100
The south wind blows and blows.

417
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:53,100
I want to hold you and don't let you go.

418
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Even though it's not normal.

419
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,100
You're smiling normally.

420
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:09,100
I wish I could use the words I love.

421
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:16,100
I wish I could use the words I love.

422
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:22,100
No, just smile by my side.

423
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Just smile by my side.

424
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,100
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
I'm sorry.

431
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,100
I'm sorry.

432
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm sorry.

433
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm sorry.

434
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I'm sorry.

435
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
I'm sorry.

436
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
I'm sorry.
