Episode 4

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I just picked up 500 yen under the vending machine.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm not sure if it's good or not.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was going to talk about the clinic, but...

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dad, Shinko, and Rune-chan are gone!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Don't cry. I'll give you a treat.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And some candy.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, I'll go find them.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Really?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm counting on you, Fisuke!

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Who's that old man?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He's the president of this place, Asakura.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, you guys.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why don't you leave the country with me?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
President?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That means...

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're the one who kidnapped us!

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, no!

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm in jail with you!

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's true.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Old man, don't tell me everything you know!

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Even if it's light, swallow your tears

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't mind it anymore

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Look at it

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Dance

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
To the end

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sakamoto Days

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're that legendary killer, Sakamoto Taro, aren't you?

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have amazing power and speed.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But you can't be lazy.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was the one who took the lead.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, what's going to happen next?

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It doesn't matter.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm going to hit the enemy.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My body is selfish.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The needle that hit Sakamoto's neck

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to make the enemy and the ally recognize each other.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I sent an electric signal.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's funny.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In other words, you can try to attack Shin.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's stronger than before.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't hate it.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's the good-tempered Morumoto?

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I was locked up here because I didn't obey their orders.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's it.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why can't I get caught?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's hard to talk about the old man.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't know

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Who are you?

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Speaking of the old days,

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're the one who misled me by mistake.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Shin?

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it the true power of Esper?

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you know Shin?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I know everything.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm the one who gave him the power of Esper.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Shin's ability is not born.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He was a normal kid.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I changed my life.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm involved in your research.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Meat is hard and soft, so I hate it.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a waste of nutrients.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Magnesium contained in meat is a risk of malnutrition.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Remember, you bastard.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You shouldn't eat that.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You should drink juice.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why am I the weight of the kid?

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I was working on the research of superpowers at the lab.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
At that time,

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
My old friend Ando left me with a kid.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was eliminated.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
My special smoothie!

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's not going well.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you doing?

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm doing research on the expansion of the brain activity limit.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a research on superpowers.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is that fun?

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're stupid.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not fun.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If it succeeds,

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The possibility of humanity will open up.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The possibility of humanity?

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It means that we can make everyone very happy.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The possibility of humanity?

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It means that we can make everyone very happy.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The possibility of humanity?

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It means that we can make everyone very happy.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Look at that.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a mess.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm jealous of you for working on such a research.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't decide on your own whether you can do it or not.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The old man is trying his best to make everyone happy.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's this reaction?

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have to combine it with the data of the past.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm thirsty.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a success.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I succeeded.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I did it.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you doing?

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you okay?

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Seriously?

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Nothing has changed.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a failure.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm glad he's safe.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He's not safe.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It was really bad.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Did I just say that?

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You just wanted to see Namiki's underwear.

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Namiki's underwear is dirty.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Unchi.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hoshi.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Zura.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's play.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm busy now.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Later.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sorry.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't want to get close.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a problem.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a problem.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wait, Shin.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll make you a medicine that will bring you back to normal.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't be like this.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You finally succeeded, but you're not happy?

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I got you involved in my stupid research.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Your research is not stupid.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Enough.

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The lab guys are boring.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know anything about you.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
After a while, he left.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't have a face to meet him.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a big drama.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But I don't care about Shin.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How do you know?

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I know you're with me every day.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Shin likes his ability.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm jealous because my manager is Makuchi.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Manager?

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's apologize together.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm fighting with Shin right now.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The 11th chapter of the Sakamoto family.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The middle is the day.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It took a little time, so I'll buy it with the worst.

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm getting stupid.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why didn't you come out so soon?

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you're here, you don't have to cooperate with their research.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey, Jo.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Did he grow up?

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Who's there?

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Shin.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Wait a minute.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We were patient.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:59,040
The

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
What?

185
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,600
You can turn it off with the Switch.

186
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,300
You get everything else.

187
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,300
If you're on his side, you'll be able to stop his reflexes.

188
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Even the legendary killer is powerless in front of great science.

189
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
You're a piece of shit.

190
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Even if you can read your mind, it's pointless if you can't follow his body.

191
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,300
Why does the boss have such a stupid ability?

192
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Why does the boss have such a stupid ability?

193
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Stupid?

194
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,300
It's too plain, I can't even suck it.

195
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
You're a piece of shit.

196
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Don't get too dirty. It's a hassle to wash your clothes.

197
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,300
And his power is not stupid.

198
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,300
I'll prove it to you now.

199
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Azamakas.

200
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,300
If you're too different in IQ, you won't get along.

201
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
I'll kill you.

202
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
You're a piece of shit.

203
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Azamakas, I'm sorry.

204
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
It's an easy story.

205
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Mr. Axe.

206
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Final experiment begins.

207
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
You're a piece of shit.

209
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
In straight.

210
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Why is he avoiding me?

211
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Is he avoiding me by sending me to Sakamoto?

212
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
You bastard!

213
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
You bastard!

214
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
I thought I was going to die.

215
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Stay still.

216
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
I got it.

217
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Thanks.

218
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Shin, thank you.

219
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,300
We have to apologize to you.

220
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Don't worry about it.

221
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,300
I like this ability and where I am now.

222
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,300
I see. I'm glad you're fine.

223
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm working at the shop at Mr. Sakamoto's place.

224
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
The sales are going up really fast.

225
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Thank you for your help.

226
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,300
I'm glad I retired, but it's so hard to avoid Mr. Sakamoto's attacks.

227
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,300
But I'm getting stronger as I get fatter.

228
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Why are you killing me by imagination?

229
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
You're getting fat by avoiding me.

230
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
The next day

231
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,300
According to the lab, Lu is probably in the basement of Bion.

232
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Let's hurry.

233
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,300
I thought about it in the battle just now, but Mr. Sakamoto is the strongest.

234
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
The order guys are so strong.

235
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Mr. Sakamoto is from the organization he used to be in, right?

236
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Is he that strong?

237
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Well, there are a lot of guys.

238
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,300
If you fight with 10 people in order, it takes 6 seconds to destroy them all.

239
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,300
It doesn't even take a second for one person.

240
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
That Nagumo guy is also in the order, right?

241
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,300
He didn't look that strong.

242
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
If you're in the order, pretend you're dead.

243
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Mr. Sakamoto!

244
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
I don't like it.

245
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Even though it's just the beginning.

246
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,300
But I have a reliable friend.

247
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Mr. Onigahara. Mr. Takamido.

248
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Well then.

249
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Look, I told you.

250
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,300
I caught three big ones.

251
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
It was a good place to rampage.

252
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Mr. Tonakai.

253
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
Order.

254
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
What does the dog look like?

255
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
It doesn't seem to be a shitsun.

256
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Please don't look at me like that.

257
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
It's as wide as a maze here.

258
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
This is rude.

259
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I'll show you the way out if you don't mind.

260
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I'd like to ask you something.

261
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Is Sura here?

262
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
If he's here, I'd like to kill him.

263
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,300
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Well, it's okay.

265
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
On the way,

266
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:47,300
I was under the pretext of murder, such as illegal weapons manufacturing and acts of violence against people.

267
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm sorry, but I'll kill them all.

268
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Oh, and can you lend me the bathroom?

269
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Boss, can I kill him?

270
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Why are you so stingy?

271
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Please, Mr. Onigahara. Mr. Takamido.

272
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Are those people okay, Shishiba?

273
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little...

274
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
What? You didn't like it?

275
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
You're a mess, so I wanted to get away.

276
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
That's enough.

277
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
No, it's not like I'm angry.

279
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
I was wrong to wear a cheap dress.

280
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,300
But that blood has been on you from the beginning.

281
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
You're a friend.

282
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Do you think people's lives are important?

283
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Yes.

284
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,300
All the people you've killed are...

285
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,300
They may have family or friends.

286
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
I feel sorry for them.

287
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I have to kill them.

288
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,300
I don't have the right to call a killer a murderer who doesn't know the dignity of a person's life.

289
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I thought they killed a lot of people.

290
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,300
It's gross to see someone like that.

291
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,300
The boss is a good guy, too.

292
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,300
My actions are all based on his will.

293
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Therefore, my killing is a meaningful and forgiven act.

294
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
That's right.

295
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,300
It's related to Sola.

296
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
Captain Shishiba?

297
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,300
You're a fool.

298
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,300
I'll let you go even if you're on baseball.

299
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
What the hell?

300
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,300
Excuse me. I'm an artificial skeleton.

301
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
It's a skeleton.

302
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
It's been a long time, Shishiba.

303
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
How are you?

304
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
I'm fine.

305
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,300
This is a new employee.

306
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
You haven't seen him, have you?

307
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
He looks like a bear.

308
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Sakamoto, you're the killer of that legend.

309
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Who is that?

310
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Who is that?

311
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
He's the boss of the group that's in charge of the lab.

312
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
He's really stubborn.

313
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,300
The only person who hurt that person.

314
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,300
You know Sola?

315
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:49,300
I don't know why you're here, but I have to kill him as soon as possible and hand him over to him.

316
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Seriously, is this a final?

317
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Then...

318
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Excuse me.

319
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,300
You look strong, human weapon.

320
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
What's wrong, Saragi?

321
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
I have to take Ruu and meet Sakamoto-san.

322
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
I'll be late for dinner.

323
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
You...

324
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
You're a transparent bastard.

325
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,300
It's the easiest thing to do.

326
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
I have to do it.

327
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
Ruu is safe, right?

328
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm just doing it under orders.

329
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
If I kill you, I'll get a bonus.

330
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Huh?

331
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Ikedori?

332
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Well, whatever.

333
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
I'm sorry, but I'll let you through.

334
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I don't have time to spend on your small business.

335
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,300
I want to save 20 million yen by the end of the year.

336
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
But I don't like the job.

337
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
I'll let you get to the stage.

338
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Let's end this quickly.

339
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
There!

340
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
Damn it!

341
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I can get the enemy position if I read my thoughts.

342
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
But I can't help it if I can't see the attack trajectory.

343
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
But I don't like getting up early.

344
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
So stick to the stage.

345
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
This guy...

346
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Is he a human?

347
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
We have something else to do.

348
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
I'll leave it to you.

349
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Okay.

350
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Thanks for everything.

351
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Is that bear okay?

352
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,300
No, it's not a bear. It's a sly bear.

353
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,300
That bear doesn't look strong at all.

354
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
I think it's going to die.

355
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,300
That next move is pretty good.

356
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,300
It's a tough one for Saga.

357
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,300
But I can't imagine him dying.

358
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
It's a pain to face Esper.

359
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
I'm getting close to getting rid of him.

360
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,300
It's a pain to face a transparent human.

361
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
But it's almost time for the stage.

362
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
I'll let you get up.

363
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm getting tired.

364
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,300
I can't get rid of him with this.

365
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
What? What are you talking about?

366
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Look at this, P-ske!

367
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
It's a transparent human!

The southern wind touches my clothes.

392
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,300
These days when our feelings overlap.
