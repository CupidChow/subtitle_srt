1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
The Legendary Killer

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,680
The legendary killer I admired, Sakamoto-san,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,440
retired from the killer after falling in love.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,840
And that was to get the warmth of everyday life.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,680
And then, Satsuren sent in more and more killers.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,040
Apparently, Sura sent in a $1 million check for Sakamoto-san.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,320
I won't forgive him!

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,640
And he sent out the evil killers to Japan,

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,760
and Sakamoto-san came here to destroy his precious life.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,520
I'll make sure to get him back!

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,840
Sura

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,680
Please, let me go!

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,640
Why are you after me?

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,600
Who are you?

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,800
You're scared, aren't you?

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,600
So cute...

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,860
I Like you...

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,260
Huh?

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,120
Was he this ugly?

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,200
He was even cuter the minute before.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
I see.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
You were so cute until just now.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Oh, I see.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Humans are the cutest when they're scared of death.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
But when I look at that sign,

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
I get excited and kill it.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Am I a short-tempered person?

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
The End

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I guess my job tomorrow is done.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Who's there?

31
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Huh?

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
The End

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Now I finally understand you.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
After all, the contents of a person are important.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Huh?

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm getting a sense of it.

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm curious.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm curious. I'm curious. I'm curious.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm curious.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm curious. I'm curious. I'm curious. I'm curious.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm curious. I'm curious.

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
This...

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
It's 484 yen.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
This is good.

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Not enough.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
This won't do.

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Where is S Rank?

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Hey, hey.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,200
It's been a while, so everyone's been too excited.

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I can't handle someone who's too fast.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
What? Work?

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yeah, go to sleep.

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
What a waste.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
What a waste.

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Knowing his personality, past, and various dramas,

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
the end is exciting.

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Now, which one is the most enjoyable?

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
The End

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Sakamoto, I'll leave the young lady to you.

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll continue investigating Sla.

61
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Be careful with the dead.

62
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
They're a pleasure killer.

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
They're different from killers and mafias.

64
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,200
U-turns have changed surprisingly.

65
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
In the end, we brought back the money we increased.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
For now, we're collecting information about the enemy.

67
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Hello, Sakamoto.

68
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
What kind of information are you looking for today?

69
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I want to know about the death of Keishu the other day.

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Then, let's go to the psycho-horror section.

71
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh, this too.

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
It's almost R18.

73
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
For now, I'll watch from the shoulder.

74
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
If you're scared, you can close your eyes.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
The bill is 183,000 yen.

76
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll buy it.

77
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Every time.

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
The End

79
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Did you hear that?

80
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Recently, the bad guys are getting wild.

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I don't like it.

82
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm scared of bad guys.

83
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
You're a mess.

84
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:02,180
The

85
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Back up.

86
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
The highway and the back are open.

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Why are you so bad at driving?

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
You're a kid.

89
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Drive more carefully.

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
You're getting old.

91
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Shishiba said to do it.

93
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
You're a kid.

94
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
You drive with both hands.

95
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
The

96
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Anyway, it doesn't matter if it's Keishu.

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
The guy who has my island is just a kill.

98
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,200
The dead Yankee said that at the beginning of the movie I saw yesterday.

99
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Did you see it today?

100
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Don't be so excited.

101
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
What?

102
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
The

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
I thought I was going to do it now.

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,200
But you're an amateur to say you killed a murderer.

105
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
What are you thinking?

106
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I don't understand.

107
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,200
When the spiritual sense and parents are absent, the killing brake doesn't work.

108
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Maybe it's surprisingly strong.

109
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
You don't have a killing brake either.

110
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
There is.

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Hey!

112
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
You're a bastard.

113
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
There was a person who didn't have a killing brake.

114
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
It's a little bit of an accelerator.

115
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
As expected of Mr. Takamura.

116
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Well, if there are four enemies anyway.

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Even if one person is killed, the fish will come.

118
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Shishiba-san, let's go eat tonkatsu.

119
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I don't care if you're dead.

120
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Stop it!

121
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Oh, you're sleeping.

122
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
What?

123
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
It's just black.

124
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Oh, that's amazing, Taro.

125
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
With this, 99 consecutive catches have been successful.

126
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Did you miss one shot?

127
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,200
No, but training together is fun.

128
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Heisuke, I'll ask you to do another shot before people come.

129
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
That's amazing.

130
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
As expected of Mr. Sakamoto.

131
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Oh, Shi!

132
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Well, even though I've done that much training.

133
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I'll die when I die.

134
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
What do you want, Nagumo?

135
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
As expected, you've been exposed.

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
No, Shi!

137
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
You've changed the atmosphere.

138
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
I heard, Sakamoto-kun.

139
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,200
I heard that you've been following the death penalty that Tsurawa hired recently.

140
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
So what?

141
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
The order has already been moved on this matter.

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I see.

143
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,200
The shopkeeper at Shigarai Shoten won't take action.

144
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
No.

145
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Nothing will change even if I wait.

146
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,200
My friend's me is warning you.

147
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
There will be an order for a death penalty anyway.

148
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I want information about Slur.

149
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I want to contact him before he gets killed by the order.

150
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
You want to kill him?

151
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
You're as naive as ever.

152
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I'll tell you what the enemy is thinking of you right now.

153
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
What's this?

154
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
B rank.

155
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
It means an easy prey.

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
By the way, I was in S rank.

157
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
The End

158
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
The cats are so cute!

159
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Let's buy them quickly and finish the job.

160
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
What are you buying?

161
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
It's a store's external wall repair.

162
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Recently, there's a hole in the wall for some reason.

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Just a little more!

164
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
You don't have to rush.

165
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
You're so carefree.

166
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
You're just a big fat dead-end.

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
You saw it at the beauty salon the other day.

168
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
It's okay because the shopkeeper is strong.

169
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
That's not it.

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,200
To be honest, we're just like Sakamoto's legs right now.

171
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
If we want to be close to Sakamoto, we can't stay like this.

172
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
We have to get stronger.

173
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Listen!

174
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Would you like to hold him?

175
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I'm in a hurry.

176
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
He's so cute!

177
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm not interested in dogs.

178
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm not going home.

179
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Sen, it's time to go.

180
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Just a little more.

181
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
What's wrong?

182
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Are you going to the bathroom?

183
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Don't look like that.

184
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
What's wrong?

185
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
You're stupid.

186
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,200
The answer to a dangerous person is not to be afraid.

187
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
It's a way to run away with your tail.

188
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Who are you?

189
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm a soldier.

190
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I've seen a lot of people die easily.

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
It's a waste.

192
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,200
The last one is dramatic.

193
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,200
So I decided to help you and make you feel better.

194
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,200
First, let's make Odebu's family and friends die.

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Let's go.

196
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I can't waste time on MOB.

197
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm tired of tempo.

198
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Sen, this guy...

199
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
You're wrong.

200
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
He's a criminal.

201
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I thought you were a criminal.

202
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Did you guard with a ball?

203
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
You're a good move, Shin.

204
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Why did you call me?

205
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
It's written here that all who die die.

206
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
The only daughter of the Lu family, Lu Xiaotan, rank C.

207
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Former killer, Shin of Esper, rank D.

208
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Hey, wait a minute.

209
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I lost to Lu.

210
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,200
By the way, you're second from the bottom.

211
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Why are you laughing?

212
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Shut up.

213
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Don't be so depressed, Shin.

214
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,200
The last one to rank D will come to you equally.

215
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
D.

216
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Good.

217
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Lu Xiaotan, rank C.

218
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
You're a murderer.

219
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
I'll make you rank D.

220
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Killing is your hobby.

221
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
You're hurting me.

222
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
You're like a terrifying murderer.

223
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
You killed many people.

224
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Everyone should be grateful to me.

225
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,200
In any movie or manga,

226
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,200
if there was a shocking or touching drama at the end,

227
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I thought it was an interesting work.

228
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
People are the same.

229
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I feel sorry for my boring life.

230
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,200
So I'm just giving you the best last.

231
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Don't worry.

232
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I'll make your life very interesting.

233
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
What's wrong with him?

234
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Are you okay, Lu?

235
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Good luck.

236
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Oh, no.

237
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
I can't read where you're flying.

238
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I can't hear you.

239
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I can't find a weapon.

240
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
How about a tonkatsu or a cup?

241
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Watch out!

242
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
You're an Esper, right, Xin?

243
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,200
You're so clear in my head.

244
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,200
If I kill a boring guy like you,

245
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
I'll be full of brains.

246
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Get away from Xin!

247
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
You're using a nail gun to make a masterpiece.

248
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
That's normal.

249
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Did you do it?

250
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
You guys are interesting.

251
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,200
The more you struggle, the more you're moved.

252
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
This guy is so boring.

253
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
He's not normal either.

254
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,200
It's important to disinfect your wound immediately.

255
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Hey, Lu!

256
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Did you cover your eyes?

257
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I smell alcohol.

258
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Damn it!

259
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
It's my fault!

260
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm weak!

261
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Lu will die if I don't do something.

262
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
What should I do?

263
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
You're late.

264
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Where's Xin?

265
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
They'll be fine.

266
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I don't know much about Xin from the Killing House era.

267
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
He's excellent.

268
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
He's Taro's buddy, right?

269
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,200
He has potential, but...

270
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Xin has little experience in looking at the real thing.

271
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I think he's better than me.

272
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Really?

273
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Probably.

274
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I didn't look at the real thing.

275
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
You're different.

276
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
You're so annoying, Xin.

277
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
You don't have any more?

278
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Crying or getting drunk?

279
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Even if you have a lot of fun,

280
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,200
it's no use using a boring guy.

281
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,200
I want to look at your head now.

282
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,200
What do you think about at the end of your life?

283
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Enjoy this moment more.

284
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

285
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Next is Sakamoto's family.

286
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm interested in Sakamoto.

287
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,200
The death of his father who was robbed of everything he loved.

288
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,200
It's the best ending.

289
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,200
What would he think if his family were killed?

290
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,200
The last day of the Killing House era.

291
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Sakamoto!

292
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I broke it.

293
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,200
What's this weird feeling?

294
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
What?

295
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Stop it before you move your right hand.

296
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I can see your future.

297
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
What's this?

298
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
The atmosphere is clearly different from before.

299
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
It's a super reaction.

300
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
No, it's not a reaction.

301
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,200
It's like I can see the future.

302
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
It's a super reaction.

303
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Thanks to you,

304
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,200
I was struggling to avoid that noisy thought.

305
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,200
I got a deep insight.

306
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I won't let you hurt my loved ones.

307
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
The next day.

308
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

309
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

310
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

311
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

312
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

313
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

314
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

315
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

316
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

317
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

318
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

319
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

320
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.

321
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm looking forward to killing you.
