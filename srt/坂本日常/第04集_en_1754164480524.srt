00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Shin-Soku!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I hate crowds.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's finish this quickly and go home.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You idiot.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Don't say such a lame thing.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's go to Hardboiled.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't say such a thing from above.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're a Boil fan.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's a lot of fun.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hey!

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Watch your step, Obiguro.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's Alisan.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I won't take lives other than the target.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He's my motto.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's with Alisan?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's so cool!

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey!

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't you want to be a hero?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He's so kind!

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The End

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hurry.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hurry up.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You'll get hurt if you move.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hurry up!

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're so pathetic.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're so mean.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're so mean.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, you still have one eye left.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're so mean.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm glad you have this.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, it's the basics of being a Poisoner.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Where did you get hired?

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If you say that, will you overlook me?

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Is this your Poison Knife?

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ouch.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll give you one drop of the poison in a second.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You should talk to me before you're empty.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You still have one eye left!

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're so mean!

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I was hired by a company called Don Denkai.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The bad jobs are also based on one-off black companies.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, there's no black or shit in the dark society.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're talking so lightly even though you said you were ready to die.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't want to die.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Besides, I'm like a part-time job.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm not a loyal employee to the company.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you a killer of Satsuren?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Of course.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's Satsuren?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, I still have one.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A group of Japanese killers?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's an organization that controls professional killers.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sakamoto and I used to be a group of people.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There are only about 400 professionals in Japan.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's like a driver's license.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not something you can get easily.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're a bad photographer.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Give it back!

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hey, can I ask you something?

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You used to be called Oda.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Really?

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oda?

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, it's not a urban legend.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, there they are!

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Mom, Dad and the others are here!

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I was wondering where they went.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm hungry.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, the bad guy who got beaten up earlier!

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you doing?

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, I was practicing for the Hero Show.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I thought it was amazing.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I see. Good job.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hana, I made lunch.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's great.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There was a seat over there.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm looking forward to Hana's lunch.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The rice balls are...

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
...kara-ko and shangri-la...

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll take care of this over here.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't get involved anymore.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Huh?

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Kurosano Station?

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Of course.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We're here to enjoy the amusement park.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That show was cool!

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Bye-bye!

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Did you say bye-bye?

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah!

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I gave you a ride on the ride.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're great, Hana.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Those weirdos...

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm getting dizzy.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll ride it again and go home.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What's wrong?

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm feeling dizzy from the side effects of the poison.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I might not be able to read my mind today.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're so ungrateful!

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is the first time I've ever felt this way.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go home, Manager.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's dangerous.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm the one who's always not in the mood.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey, everyone.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mama? What's wrong?

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Everyone's acting weird today.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Did you hide something?

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Nothing, Masa.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We know I think that's to hit me with the basement.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Stop.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Get your hands off me.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Or I'll give you a hard time.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Get your hands off me!

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You'reÃ¤

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Tomatoes.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
You're a girl.

123
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't just stand there and do nothing.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,640
Don't let your eyes get in the way.

125
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,000
A girl?

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,040
Tsk.

127
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,200
What are you here for, Boyle-san?

128
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,760
Obiguro-san?

129
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,480
You guys are so ignorant.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,800
Geez, it's like a professor in a printed book.

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,880
You're just a head-on-head, as you say.

132
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,280
You should be grateful.

133
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,640
I'm sure you are.

134
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm looking forward to it.

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,960
The legendary man, Takamoto Taro.

136
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,600
You've never met him before, have you?

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
This wound is going to hurt.

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,240
What?

139
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,880
Could that wound be from back in the day?

140
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,200
No!

141
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
I fell a little bit earlier.

142
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,160
What?

143
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,080
Just by falling, you're saying that?

144
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,480
They're just making a fool of themselves.

145
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,480
In the Balkan War two years ago,

146
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,720
they were said to have killed over 100 people.

147
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,200
A super-battle-hardy duo in the Balkans.

148
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,480
They're dead.

149
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,400
What are you saying?

150
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
You can't do that kind of thing for a job!

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,320
Maybe they didn't have enough bento?

152
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,680
Or maybe they got sick?

153
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,560
Do you guys hate amusement parks?

154
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,400
They're so energetic!

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,640
And they're so much fun!

156
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,840
This guy's so excited he fell off the coaster!

157
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,280
What?

158
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,600
Oh, it's just my misunderstanding.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,080
Then can we go to the place we want to go next?

160
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Of course!

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,080
Let's go anywhere!

162
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,960
Where are we going next?

163
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
The Ferris Wheel!

164
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,800
The Ferris Wheel

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,880
Sakonoto-san, we can't see the square right now.

166
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
It's okay.

167
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,360
It's bright and spacious here.

168
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,200
It's not the right place for assassinations.

169
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,920
We're here!

170
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,240
The Ghost House!

171
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,960
It's perfect for assassinations!

172
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,320
Welcome to the Scorched-Gate Hospital.

173
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,240
This is a haunted mansion where the sounds of patients

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,760
who were stabbed by a mad doctor come from.

175
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,160
Be careful.

176
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,720
No one has stepped in here and survived.

177
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm so excited today!

178
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm scared!

179
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,040
What's that?

180
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,400
It's a medicine that relieves tension.

181
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,800
What a weirdo.

182
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Well, then, have a good day.

183
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
Well, let's go to Splatter Horror.

184
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
This is the best haunted mansion in Japan.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
It's high quality.

186
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,400
It's definitely high quality.

187
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,280
Madam, I'm glad you had fun.

188
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,600
Don't lose your cool.

189
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Yes, of course.

190
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
The enemy!

191
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
It's a bird again!

192
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,800
Huh?

193
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,560
It stopped moving.

194
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,520
I was scared, so I pretended to be the madam's blind spot.

195
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,480
You're great, Sakamoto!

196
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,520
I'm scared!

197
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,200
A murder license?

198
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,880
It's a new license, a rookie license.

199
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,600
With this level of license, you don't need to worry that much.

200
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
With this level of license...

201
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,360
You're definitely a bit of a nerd, but you have a lot of room.

202
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,560
I want to see how serious this guy is.

203
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,760
Just imagining it makes me so excited.

204
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,880
Don't put your hand out there.

205
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,600
I'll make him a Hardboiled.

206
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
You're so noisy.

207
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,120
You're so stressed out, you should get some rest.

208
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,280
I'll give you a break, even if you don't worry.

209
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,360
You're an important friend, right?

210
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,080
I'm not a Hardboiled.

211
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,960
That bastard is a Hardboiled.

212
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,360
Hey, did you say Sakamoto?

213
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,160
I heard.

214
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,920
You're a tough guy.

215
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,840
I heard that Hardboiled got mad at you for practicing martial arts.

216
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
I was wondering what kind of bastard he was.

217
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,480
Don't get me wrong.

218
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,360
Don't get me wrong.

219
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm not just a thug.

220
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,040
You're a Hardboiled.

221
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,400
I like you.

222
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,760
He and I were like-minded people.

223
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,720
We were more likely to be together,

224
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,480
not just on missions or classes.

225
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,160
Did you hear that, Sakamoto?

226
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,440
Today is Valentine's Day.

227
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,600
Well, we Hardboiled are just chocolate.

228
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
Life is a game.

229
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,520
He's here!

230
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,320
Um, Sakamoto!

231
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
Please accept this.

232
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
It's chocolate made from the 44 Magnum Karayakkyo that Sakamoto likes.

233
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
Sakamoto.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Huh? Nagumo.

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I got a lot from the female assassins.

236
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,200
Who is she?

237
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,920
I don't know.

238
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,280
You!

239
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,680
If you want chocolate, you can eat it.

240
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,440
I guess the female assassins turned her down.

241
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,760
Get out of my way!

242
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,040
You idiot!

243
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,720
I thought we were similar,

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,040
but he wasn't a Hardboiled at all.

245
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,720
He's totally a traitor!

246
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,080
I see.

247
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,440
Then this job is a match of fate for you.

248
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,160
One after another...

249
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,320
No!

250
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,480
I don't care!

251
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,120
He's strong!

252
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
He's cute!

253
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,480
How many people are hiding?

254
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,440
A terrifying human rights group.

255
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,680
I want to go home already.

256
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,240
It's so much fun with all the zombies!

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,760
What's next?

258
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,400
Sakamoto's daughter is amazing.

259
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,600
Unlike you, she's got a lot of guts.

260
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,440
Shut up!

261
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,760
Give it to me!

262
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,960
What's that you've been doing?

263
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,160
It's a drug for the secret Mayoke of the Ru family.

264
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,080
It's alcohol!

265
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,720
What kind of drug is this?

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,680
This isujita!

267
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,560
I want to throw it!

268
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,280
What is it?

269
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,140
future

270
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,560
Shut up yapping!

271
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
Hurry up!

272
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
I'll push it off your knees!

273
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Treason

274
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
Get out of my way.

275
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
Hey, Sakamoto.

276
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
Do you remember me?

277
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,780
No I don't.

278
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,280
Where's your family?

279
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
I shall show you hell.

280
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,760
I will never let you get your memory back.

281
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I don't care if you die!

282
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
Aoi! Hana!

283
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Thank goodness.

284
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,260
I'm just fainted.

285
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
You've made me a poor man.

286
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I'm not good enough to be a fool like you.

287
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Who are you?

288
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
What?

289
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,760
Come here, grandma.

290
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,260
I want to see you get a good 4000-year-old skill.

291
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,260
A retired player?

292
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,760
A young player?

293
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,260
I'm going to kill you!

294
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,260
Oh, you're a good-tempered one.

295
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,760
I'm getting excited.

296
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,760
You really don't remember me, Sakamoto?

297
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
You're persistent.

298
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,760
I don't remember.

299
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,760
Where's your family?

300
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,760
I'll tell you one thing.

301
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
I don't remember much either.

302
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,260
You'd better answer my question.

303
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
You can find what you want.

304
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm not your mother.

305
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm sorry, Sakamoto.

306
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,760
It's started.

307
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Where are you looking, grandma?

308
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,260
You're good.

309
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,760
You're not uselessly powerful.

310
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,260
You're just a little kid.

311
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,760
You're good.

312
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
You're not uselessly powerful.

313
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,260
You're good at punching.

314
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,760
I'm good.

315
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,760
But you're not quite there yet.

316
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,260
I'm not feeling well.

317
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,260
Well, if you're curious about me,

318
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,260
you're a little bit of a quick-tempered one.

319
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
But that doesn't make you excited, does it?

320
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,260
So...

321
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,760
What the hell?

322
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,260
Why are you doing this?

323
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,260
I'll make you more serious.

324
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
From my experience,

325
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,260
I can see his real power when I'm in a rush.

326
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,260
The rules are simple.

327
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Attack me once every 10 seconds.

328
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,260
If you can't, the boy will be broken.

329
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
It's already started.

330
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm getting excited.

331
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
That's impossible!

332
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,260
I'm sorry!

333
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,260
A-Are you crying?

334
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,760
It's been five years since you retired.

335
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,260
Do you understand, Sakamoto?

336
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,260
This is the difference between me and you.

337
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,760
It's sad.

338
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,760
You were a hard-boiled kid in the past.

339
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,260
It's no use trying to be a good kid.

340
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,260
I'll use this Super Ball Bomb.

341
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,760
In other words,

342
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
SP Beat.

343
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Rocket Dynamite Punch.

344
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,260
In other words,

345
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
RDP.

346
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,260
It can be used at any distance and angle.

347
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
Have you forgotten that?

348
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
You're a jerk.

349
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Hey, look, Sakamoto!

350
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
Nagumo!

351
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Set up a dynamite here.

352
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Use the blast's propulsion to make use of it.

353
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,260
That's interesting.

354
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
What's your name?

355
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Rocket Dynamite Punch.

356
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,260
In other words, RDP.

357
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
You're a jerk.

358
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
Make it a Super Punch.

359
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,260
Super?

360
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Oh, there's a Super Ball.

361
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
You can use both of them.

362
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
No, no, Super Ball is...

363
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,260
Huh?

364
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
Super Punch?

365
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
I've always admired you!

366
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,260
You've done all kinds of missions and even got a job.

367
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,260
I can't believe you've gotten so weak!

368
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,260
I won't forgive you!

369
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,260
You can't protect your family!

370
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
You're just a...

371
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,260
Lev!

372
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
