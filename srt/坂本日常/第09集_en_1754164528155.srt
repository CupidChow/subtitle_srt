1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't do anything to someone who doesn't value the people around him.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're a smart fool.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sure my subordinates will kill such important friends by now.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't worry.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not as weak as you think.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I hate people who talk back to me after Christmas.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sakamoto Taro!

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I hate people who talk like you.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I hate people who talk like you.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Damn it. It looks like our escape has been found out.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Excuse me. I'll leave you here.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're a hostage.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to get out of here and apologize to Shin.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Eesuke, this is a good timing.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A good timing?

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're still a piece of shit, Shiko!

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you're scared of death,

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Make your finger print the way you step out.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, step on the accelerator until it turns red.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's not enough.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's still too early.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sure it's standing on its own.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Even if it turns red, swallow your tears.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't mind it.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Look at it.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Jump out.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Run, Sakamoto Reis.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There was a sniper who wanted to stand out.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's scary when you know where it is.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is that okay?

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm kidding.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're the best.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's the same as standing in front of me.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's gone again.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can hear it even if I hide.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I won't let you get away.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That guy is...

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't hear anything.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's up there!

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What's that?

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can see it.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can aim at it.

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Did you think it was super power?

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you wear this suit, you can do anything.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, first of all, you...

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Another joke?

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You took my arm.

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't give up.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Next is the head.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Run, Heisuke!

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What?

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Just one arm!

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Heisuke!

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's strange.

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why are you guys doing this for someone else?

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You should have just killed the one who was in trouble.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You should go home now.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wait.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They called me a top sniper.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then...

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't lie to my friends.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's annoying.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then die.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Die!

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, it's a good thing I didn't hit you.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong with you?

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm counting on you.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Die!

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh no, I'm going to die.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm going to die!

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm going to die if I see you.

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
My body is...

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm tired.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
As expected.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It seems that you have taken my thoughts.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't know what you're thinking.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Really?

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What?

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's started.

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've prepared a place for you.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've prepared a place for you.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've prepared a place for you.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In 20 minutes, this lab will be destroyed.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your friends...

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
20 minutes.

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
5 minutes is enough.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's hard to move.

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How is it?

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't you think my body is wonderful?

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I use the lab's science and technology to coordinate 70% of my body with weapons.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You are a pig on a cutting board.

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have a weapon.

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This man came here to get a weapon?

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So far, it's been like this.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're a wonderful friend.

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm going to kill you.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're useless.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're useless.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're useless.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What did you do?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't see.

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The weapon is a proof of the third-rate.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're a fifth-rate if you can't defeat the third-rate.

106
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you innocent?

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know what I'm going to do.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
For the man who gave me everything...

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I...

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm going to kill you.

111
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're a hypocrite who can't give up on yourself.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're a pleasant person.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How far are you going?

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You talk a lot.

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm bored with routine work every day.

116
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Something amazing is going to happen.

117
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is it a subway?

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I was connected to the subway.

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sure he was thirsty.

120
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wonderful.

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sakamoto is the favorite of that man.

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He fights using the things around him and the situation as his skill.

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He's like a powerful weapon.

124
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He's the ultimate killer.

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Where did you hide?

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Haya...

127
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you're going to kill someone who's innocent, don't worry about killing them.

128
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why did he do such a terrible thing?

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He said he was bullying a stray cat.

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why am I being blamed?

131
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's wrong with eliminating the bad guys?

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm scared.

133
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Someone, call the police.

134
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm always doing things for people.

135
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No one understands me.

136
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're a good person.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There aren't many people who can do things for someone like you.

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
For the sake of justice, you need evil.

139
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But the people around me are all saying I'm a bad person.

140
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're on my side, aren't you?

141
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll accept everything.

142
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Will you fight with me?

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
For the sake of justice...

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I want to see that man's dream.

145
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll have you disappear if you get in my way.

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is the priority seat.

147
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Please, take it.

148
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Thank you.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't keep up with him.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't go.

151
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What is this powerful power?

152
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He's just a human.

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Damn it!

154
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's over.

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Now I can finally get rid of that evil.

156
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Now I can get praise from that man.

157
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I need to get dressed before I meet him.

158
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm coming.

159
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm coming.

160
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why don't you know?

161
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're a nobody who forgot your dreams and ideals.

162
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You need a man like us for your world.

163
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you.

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't understand.

165
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're a bad person.

166
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't want a family member like you.

167
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't want a family member like you.

168
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sakamoto, are you okay?

169
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Did you take care of the boss?

170
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you.

171
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Where's Lu?

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He's almost here.

173
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But the lab...

174
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The lab's condition is caused by a self-destruct device.

175
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It'll be destroyed in 15 minutes.

176
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Naito!

177
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hurry.

178
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What the hell is going on?

179
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's collapsing!

180
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't be so confident about collapsing.

181
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't want to die!

182
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Get out of here!

183
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Shin!

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm glad you're here.

185
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What's wrong?

186
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's hurry.

187
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Shin!

188
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry for being so mean!

189
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm the bad guy!

190
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll get the apron and the treasure!

191
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't get your nose wet!

192
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I didn't mean to.

193
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I mean...

194
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I said too much.

195
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't understand, but I'm glad you're here.

197
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Shin!

198
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Boss?

199
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hey.

200
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's been a while.

201
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh.

202
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We're 10 minutes away from the lab collapsing!

203
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, what about the others?

204
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There's more to come.

205
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Boss, do you have a map of the lab?

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

207
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's it.

208
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What are we going to do? We don't have time.

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What's going on?

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Someone help me!

211
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Rue, Heisuke!

212
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I can still hear people on this floor.

213
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Can you do me a favor?

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We'll talk later!

215
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Boss, come with me to the basement.

216
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Shin, you've used your abilities to kill us.

217
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's been useful, isn't it?

218
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Boss' research.

219
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Shin, you...

220
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Damn it.

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Shishiba, are you still here?

222
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm tired of killing you.

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I trust you, Osaragi.

224
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, Bingo.

225
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I knew he was behind the scenes.

226
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Sura, you finally caught him.

227
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Are you going this way?

228
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, I couldn't see you.

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're useless.

230
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This is the enemy of the murder.

231
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's strong.

232
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It doesn't matter.

233
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When I fought with the Order,

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
they all died.

235
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Shin, which way?

236
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There are two people in front of us.

237
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I can hear one voice from here.

238
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Osaragi, you take care of this.

239
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I got it.

240
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There he is!

242
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What was that?

243
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're Shin, aren't you?

244
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm Sakamoto.

245
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What's going on?

246
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We're saved!

247
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He's been released.

248
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm glad he's alive.

249
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Boss, he's here.

250
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Rue, Sakamoto!

251
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Shin, are you okay?

252
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Boss!

253
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Where's Kenawa?

254
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Is everyone okay?

255
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The lab is broken.

256
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't worry about us.

257
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The research data is all here.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I see.

259
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He looks fine.

260
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Thank you.

261
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He's a little bit handsome.

262
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're all talking in circles.

263
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He's a little bit handsome.

264
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Shut up!

265
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You're all the people at Sakamoto Shoten?

266
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm relieved he's having fun.

267
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm counting on you.

268
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'll leave it to you, boss.

269
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah.

270
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Why is everyone so scattered?

271
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, there's a lot going on at the museum.

272
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Take out the laundry.

273
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Dad, I told Hana to come to the museum.

274
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm glad you asked, Hana.

275
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Rue, I'll take it if you're sleeping.

276
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You took it!

277
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't be so stingy.

278
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll take this.

279
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
My konjac jikwa jelly!

280
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This is no good.

281
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's worth more than one.

282
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you say so, fried shrimp is more valuable.

283
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You're a kid after all.

284
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You're losing your life.

285
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Why are you killing me in your imagination?

286
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're so stubborn.

287
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I want to be by your side and laugh.

288
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I want to sneak out of here

289
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and take you with me.

290
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm fine.

291
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I want to be by your side.

292
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The south wind blows and gives me a hug.

293
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
These days are overflowing with emotions.

294
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I want to hold you tight and not let you go.

295
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm not a fool.

296
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You're smiling so normally.

297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I wish I could say the words I love to you.

298
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No, just be by my side and laugh.

299
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Just be by my side and laugh.

300
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm fine.

301
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm fine.

302
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm fine.

303
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm fine.

304
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm fine.

305
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm fine.

306
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm fine.

307
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm fine.

308
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm fine.

309
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm fine.

310
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm fine.

311
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm fine.

312
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm fine.

313
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm fine.
