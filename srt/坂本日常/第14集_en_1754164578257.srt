00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 4

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Sakamoto-san, please stop!

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Why did you do this?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'll tell you.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Do it when you have the chance.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, please!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
AHHHHHHHHH!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We wanted to end the fight,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so we came to Sakamoto-san's recommended sanatorium.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're too much.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're just a needle in the hay.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to show you the sky.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to show you the sky.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to show you the paradise.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Who do you think you are?

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't have a guest like you.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Besides, I don't have a guest like you.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Besides, I don't have a guest like you.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can only fix it with Mia Bar.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't touch me, idiot!

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't touch me, idiot!

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're the one who...

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're the one who...

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's strange, but it's really comfortable.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That old lady is not a simple person.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mia Bar is a famous master of the great arm of the Koshia.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really?

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
In Koshia, it is known as the God Hand.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No matter how much you hurt yourself, it will heal.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Amazing.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Unless you die.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So, grandma, how long are you going to do this?

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're an impolite kid.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm still 98.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
At least, you can do it for one day.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Your new ability is like...

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're breathing hard and running out of energy.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you were me now, you'd have to do it for five minutes a day.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Five minutes? That's not a lot.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you want to die, do it as you like.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Grandma, I want to see it too.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to see it too.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a little dark.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Here.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I see.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is hard.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's poison in your body.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Drink this.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's Shijimi-jiru.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's refreshing.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's just two days.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll drink a little.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Taro-chan.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's delicious.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You too.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll show you.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's been a while since I saw you.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I didn't expect you to have such good friends.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're good kids.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you going to go on a rampage after this?

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why?

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is the anger pot.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It only works on the angry people.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't hide anything.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It doesn't hurt.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It hurts.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can see you're going to die after those kids are gone.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's no good running around alone.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll tell you, but you're 30% of the whole century now.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You've gotten a lot of trouble with me in the five-year blank.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
By the way, I was in the S-rank.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It doesn't matter.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I won't let them get away with it anymore.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Wait.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I know the anger pot.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's no good.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you, Miyaba.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm counting on them.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wait a minute!

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're so mean.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're lying!

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You drunkard!

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Are you looking for something?

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where is Taro Sakamoto?

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
My husband is not in the squad right now.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't hide.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I hate lying.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I hate lying too.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It seems you don't understand the situation.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Where's the money?

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hello.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Did you swallow the situation?

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Where is Taro Sakamoto?

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you're going to hide, you should do the same.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Be quiet.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What?

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You?

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're so messy.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I thought you weren't dead.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I thought you were a toy knife.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This guy is a S-rank man who is on a list.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll kill you.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I hate lying.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's impossible.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm working part-time now.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Nagumo, please change the shopkeeper.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm worried about Aoi and the others.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't want to.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You owe me.

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're a good man.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll get the pay.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If it's a friend's request, it can't be helped.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look at this, B-Suke!

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is amazing. It's a transparent floor.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's scary.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I know.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not playing.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My grandmother used to say that...

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
...when you can't find it, you live in the past.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have to get to know more people.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I want to know more about everyone.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What are you thinking?

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What are you thinking?

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What?

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Show me what's inside.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I found it, B-Suke!

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can't go back on what my grandmother said!

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What?

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's flying!

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's like a taro.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a glass-like thing!

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's that?

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you, B-Suke!

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I like threads.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You often compare people's connections.

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It works, right?

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's strange.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You seem to have a beautiful mind.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm almost safe.

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was close by.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sorry, B-Suke.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You saved me!

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I thought you'd notice.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's my signal!

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That hurt.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was hit by a bullet.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
When did I ever get a punch this strong?

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I wonder if you'd understand me.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll do this one.

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I feel a little light today.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
432 people...

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I killed 432 people, but I'm still bored.

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Would you let me be satisfied?

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You count the number of people you killed?

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're surprisingly good at this.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't break it that much.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll do it again.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll do it again.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll do it again.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm going to get angry at you.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What are you doing?

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm borrowing your phone.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You don't have a phone number, do you?

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't have many friends.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have a smartphone, too.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
When did you get it?

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was just a little busy.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll give you a little money.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm going to get you!

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Give it back!

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Do you care about privacy?

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't care.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's another alien shit.

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's so greasy.

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Where is he?

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He disappeared.

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Did he run away?

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, he's in the back hall.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He's hiding.

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Where are you?

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you going to fight me?

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Come out, you bastard!

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It was me.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This guy is so thin.

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Gums, car keys, beef bowl, receipt, and a killer's receipt.

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You don't have much information, do you?

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's all garbage.

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't care anymore.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm kind, so I'll let you choose how to die.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What? A weapon?

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Which one do you want to go with?

225
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There are six functions.

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's very convenient to have one.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's the same way every time.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a waste.

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Choose your favorite number from 1 to 6.

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're underestimating people.

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm the one who's going to get the aluminum!

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You don't want to choose?

233
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Then I'll let you choose.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Where is he?

235
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Number 3.

236
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You're not following me.

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Number 3 is a can opener for the party.

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There's no one here.

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Maybe I'm a little too messy.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, Sakamoto-kun is going to kill me.

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's strange.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't move so much because I'm so fat.

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Taro!

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't lose weight.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That old woman...

246
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What did you do?

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Are you okay?

248
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm going to kill you.

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're strong.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Taro!

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Atsuyama.

252
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Atsuyama.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He's here!

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He looks like a spider man.

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He's a weirdo.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I can't believe it.

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's too bad.

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was so clean.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's a chance.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll lose weight while he's cleaning up.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's great!

262
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
How about this?

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Why can't I lose weight?

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Titi.

265
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This guy...

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh no!

267
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He's a sharp person.

268
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
His hands are tough.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He's a weirdo.

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He's not even armed.

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't forgive him.

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What a dirty pocket.

273
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't think I can get along with you.

274
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But I feel strange and light.

275
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That Sakamoto-san is 30% of his weight?

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
At least he's fat.

277
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't believe it.

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Is he really that heavy?

279
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I guess so.

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, someone with a body like that

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
always does the same thing.

282
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's not a problem if he's that thin.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If you ask me,

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'd say he's fat.

285
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You know...

286
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I've been thinking about this for a while.

287
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're too rough.

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm not good with people like you.

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can't be careful with other people, can you?

290
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's why you're always so fine.

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're always so cold to people like me.

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not a gasas.

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Probably.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You say that with those slippers.

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Taro!

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What are those sticky slippers?

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They move so well.

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Even if your shoes are off,

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
or your bones are broken,

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the best person who can move in that state is the strongest.

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You don't know that,

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
so you'll burn calories and lose weight.

303
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I see.

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I pressed the button earlier.

305
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You know,

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
he's finally realized that he's fat.

307
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Huh?

308
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Where is he?

309
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When he accepts himself as he is,

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
he'll get strong enough without losing weight.

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
As expected of Miyaba.

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm going down.

313
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The counterattack begins.

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Wow, it's so high! It's going up!

315
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Helvetor, help me!

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What's that?

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Something fell.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What's that sound?

319
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey!

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's a good win.

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Amazing.

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're the only one who's been connected for so long.

323
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's getting more and more fun.

324
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If it's you,

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
will you listen to me?

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Sorry,

327
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but I don't have time to talk to you.

328
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

329
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

330
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

331
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

332
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

333
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

335
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

337
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

338
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

339
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

340
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

341
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

342
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I want to grab you by the shadow

343
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:39,080
Even the distant

344
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:49,080
I want to see the end of this dream

345
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Our taste is the same

346
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Osaragi, let's go to this ramen festival.

347
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,080
But this is not the destination of the target.

348
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
You're right.

349
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
You're right.

350
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
I'm hungry.

351
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Then, Katsudon.

352
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
The usual life is peaceful.

353
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,080
It's okay to eat what I want sometimes.

354
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Besides, the noodles are the will of the life.

355
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,080
If you live long, you won't die in this mission.

356
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm hungry.

357
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Let's go.

358
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm hungry.

359
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,080
You're too fast.

360
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,080
What is this?

361
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
It's a common ginger.

362
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Do you eat this?

363
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
It's important to change the taste.

364
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Then I'll give you my share.

365
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Let's ask you.

366
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,080
I want you.

367
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:13,080
It's important to change the taste.

368
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
I told you.

369
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
This is a famous place with a pachy.

370
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Excuse me, sir.

371
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm done with the pachy.

372
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,080
This pachy is mine.

373
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Osaragi, can you get me some spice?

374
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Is this red?

375
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
What is this?

376
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
It was useless.

377
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,080
It says it's useless.

378
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,080
This is the real thing.

379
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,080
If I can eat what I want, I won't leave anything behind.

380
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Excuse me.

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Target is here.

382
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
It's not a murder.

383
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:15,080
This is for U medicine.
