00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you for watching!

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you for watching!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you for watching!

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you for watching!

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you for watching!

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you for watching!

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you for watching!

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you for watching!

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you for watching!

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I almost killed him with one blow!

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Killed?

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You...

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're not going back to the killer's shop, are you?

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But...

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But you killed him a lot the other day, didn't you?

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've lowered my fatal wound.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You...

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know what I'm saying, but...

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you break the air, you're divorced!

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Div...

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Divi...div...ed!

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you know, it's fine.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll clean the outside.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Um...

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What's a kakun?

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So why do you kill me with your imagination?

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't talk about unnecessary things.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is the second-floor north Chinese street.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's huge.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But why did you come all the way here?

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Maid!

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Limited edition, 50 pieces.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Kaminikuman?

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is this your purpose?

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I changed Aoi's books.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You really care about your family.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Um...

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What was that kakun you said about?

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shut up.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just want to remember.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll just look at it.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hey, you!

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sakamoto!

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Kaminikuman!

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If it's sanded, it's still...

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, it's impossible.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I found it!

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Shut up!

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do it!

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You ran away like a cat.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can't catch me.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Um, Sakamoto-san.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have something to do.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All destroyed.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, that's not it!

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll show you!

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A big one?

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's hide!

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I got you.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're not getting away!

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're not dead.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
First, walk like you can't walk.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's this?

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Damn it!

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't move!

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Watch out!

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What's with this woman?

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
She's over there!

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go together!

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Damn it!

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
My stomach...

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm going to run away!

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wait!

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who are you?

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What happened to the woman?

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She ran away.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
She's running away with a man from the second group.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We're investigating the cause of that.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You ran away again?

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I chased her family to the point of killing them all!

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There's no point in running away like this!

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You bastard!

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry!

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Shut up!

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You bastard!

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Call them.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, sir!

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Look at this.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's still trying to survive.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't play with the body.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not worth it.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Boss.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're so angry.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Listen.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The woman needs the key.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If I have that key, I can control the dark world.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can catch the woman no matter what.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's okay.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can kill the person who gets in my way.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do as you please.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What?

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A girl from the mafia family?

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And that famous man, Luke?

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're so loud!

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why are you being chased?

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is the cause.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The key?

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My family's secret safe key.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
My parents entrusted it to me.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Throw it away.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You'll be dead.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't want to!

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
My parents wanted to protect me even if I died.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Shota, run away.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hurry up!

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If I let them go,

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can't face the two of them.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, it's none of your business.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry for getting you involved.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll say goodbye here.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can you make a real meat bun?

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Meat bun?

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, my dad taught me.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The basic seasoning is...

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Sakamoto, you'd better stop.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He's a dangerous person.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Stop the death.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll save him.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But you have to make a meat bun.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's the condition.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What are you doing?

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sakamoto!

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sakamoto!

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You were chasing me because you were in a hurry.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And it's a little dangerous.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Boss, you're going to have to do it.

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Shut up.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not a murderer.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll kill you first.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then I'll arrange the bodies.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm saying the way to kill is the problem.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Am I talking to a monkey?

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are they?

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Tonhi and Bacho are killer of twins.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
They kill their prey in exchange for money.

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They are serial killers who remember pleasure in killing.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a pervert's hobby to sketch the head of the killer.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You've become famous.

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm glad.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're a murderer.

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Are you angry because your friend was killed?

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're delicate like a girl.

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
My friend was killed?

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What are you talking about?

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're an amateur if you don't know Sakamoto.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm angry.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Damn it.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What are you?

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're a good man.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Where are we?

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That man is powerful.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Right, Bacho?

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The floor was rotten.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I have to kill him.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Woman.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you give me the key, I'll kill you.

170
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What do you think?

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is my father's body.

172
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I won't let you die.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Your parents died.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
They are more important than life.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They are not a piece of life.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Shut up.

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What are you doing?

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't be so easy.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The money is the money of the family.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going to protect it.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I see.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't get in my way.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm going to kill you.

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's not up to others to decide what's important.

185
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why?

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Why did you do that?

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You're trying to save me.

188
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Blood again.

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I just did my job.

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's a murder.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Why can you do such a terrible thing?

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I had to work to buy a present.

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't need a blood-soaked present.

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Enough.

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you don't change anything, I can't be with you.

196
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Bye.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What?

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It was higher than I thought.

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm glad it was snow.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You thought I'd be sad if I died, didn't you?

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Do you understand?

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
As you wanted to save me,

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
everyone is important to someone.

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So promise me.

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Don't kill people.

206
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This is our rule.

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
From now on, you'll be the one who saves people.

208
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I stopped.

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll go with no kill.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes, Sakamoto.

211
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You're not going to live.

212
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're a coward.

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm not going to die.

215
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm going to kill you.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm going to kill you.

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm going to kill you.

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm going to kill you.

219
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going to kill you.

220
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Are you okay, Sakamoto?

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I got a neck injury.

222
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes, it's an exit.

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What? Did you just avoid it?

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The hell cut is a deep blow.

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And that's the only way.

226
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why don't you bite?

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Magio, is that okay?

228
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's it.

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You're the third one to see this.

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't kill me.

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm scared.

232
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You bastard.

233
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Sakamoto is going to die.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
My Chakram is the strongest.

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What's this?

236
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I haven't felt this in a long time.

237
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What the hell?

238
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Sakamoto, your hand is...

239
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm not going to fight them.

240
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm going to kill them.

241
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm going to kill them.

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What the hell?

243
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Who are you?

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm just a guard.

245
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You guys are so stupid.

246
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What are you doing?

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I have a treasure in front of me.

248
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If only I had that crab.

249
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm here to deliver it.

250
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What?

251
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Bachi, Sonji.

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What are you guys?

253
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What are you doing?

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Shut up.

255
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Don't open your mouth.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You are...

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Please forgive me.

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Even if you apologize, your parents won't come back.

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll give you a death sentence.

262
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Are you sure?

263
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll give you a little more.

264
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why are you killing me?

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't do anything stupid.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is enough.

267
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm so hungry that I can't stop killing.

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm going to live happily.

269
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm going to live happily.

270
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Are you still here, Pink Head?

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Shut up.

272
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
My name is Lou Xiaotan.

273
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The key is old and it doesn't open.

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's open.

275
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What?

276
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why are you guys going first?

277
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I have a treasure.

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Book, CD, stuffed animal?

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
There are many things.

280
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a log.

281
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What is it?

282
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The history of the Lu family is to give each other the best treasure.

283
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
In other words, the things that the leader puts in are different.

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What is my father?

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What does it say?

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
When Xiaotan is an adult, he drinks with him.

287
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's new.

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What does it say?

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It says it's the best liquor in the world.

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll drink a lot of thanks.

291
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
If it's bad, I don't understand.

292
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You still have this.

293
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What is this?

294
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Why are you so depressed?

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's your fault.

296
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The taste is the same.

297
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Japanese meat buns are not bad.

298
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You should protect Sakamoto family.

369
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You should protect Sakamoto family.

370
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The first rule.

372
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You can't kill people.

373
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
If you break it, I'll kill you.

374
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You're being unreasonable.

375
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's from the murder.

376
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The money spent on this dev is

377
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The money spent on this dev is

378
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
1 billion yen.
