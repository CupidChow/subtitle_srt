00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Episode one

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,600
A month saved on Shunsuke Pi's food...

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,420
...and I spent 2,000 yen on mine

4
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,420
I want to eat more.

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,420
But that's all.

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,420
If we kill Sakamoto, we'll solve it.

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,420
Right, Bitsuke?

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,420
Yes.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,420
That's a billion yen.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,420
If that's all...

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,420
We can eat sushi!

12
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,420
But...

13
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
It's the killers who wanted the prize money.

14
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,420
The store is getting messy.

15
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,420
We need to fix the problem.

16
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,420
But we don't have money.

17
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,420
But if we win tomorrow, we'll solve it.

18
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
Hey, you're in the way.

19
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
Okay.

20
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,420
Who's Sakamoto Taro?

21
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,420
A new killer?

22
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,420
If you don't mind, I'll let you go.

23
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,420
Odeb.

24
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,420
That's Sakamoto!

25
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm just a part-timer.

26
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,420
I don't know who Sakamoto Taro is.

27
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
Huh?

28
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
Isn't this the Sakamoto store?

29
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
There are many stores like that.

30
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
Many?

31
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,420
Really?

32
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,420
He's cute.

33
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,420
What a lazy killer.

34
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,420
He didn't notice the target in front of him.

35
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
But...

36
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,420
There are many?

37
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
Huh?

38
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,420
That means...

39
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,420
We can't eat sushi?

40
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,420
What's that?

41
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,420
That's too sad.

42
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,420
This guy only thinks about good things.

43
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,420
He's so unworthy of reading.

44
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,420
But...

45
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,420
I asked the old lady on the street.

46
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,420
Sakamoto Taro is here?

47
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
Shut up.

48
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,420
The first Sakamoto Taro is probably in the country.

49
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
200 million people?

50
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,420
I can't find that many.

51
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,420
How much does it cost?

52
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,420
I don't have any money.

53
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,420
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,420
He's looking.

56
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,420
Thank you so much.

58
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
Come back to eat.

59
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,420
I'm happy to have meat.

60
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,420
There are many stupid killers.

61
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,420
They're surprisingly alive.

62
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,420
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,420
Damn.

64
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,420
I missed the target.

65
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,420
I can't get out of the tent.

66
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,420
This tent is also a life.

67
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
I'm glad the old lady is here.

68
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,420
Let's live in a big house together.

69
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,420
P.S.K.

70
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,420
You're not good for a killer.

71
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
Stop it.

72
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,420
Let's go.

73
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,420
I want to see the guys who made us.

74
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Soba game tournament.

75
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,420
1 million?

76
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,420
If you have 1 million, you can buy a mansion.

77
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm lucky.

78
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,420
You're aiming for the championship.

79
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
1 million.

80
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,420
I'm delivering the mission for the team.

81
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,420
This is KIL2U.

82
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
It's authentic.

83
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Don't be a fool.

84
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Let's fight.

85
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
You come out too.

86
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,420
I don't play that kind of game.

87
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,420
I heard there's money in the money.

88
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,420
The other person is an amateur.

89
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,420
I'm in trouble.

90
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,420
No.

91
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,420
I want to participate.

92
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,420
You're saying it's impossible to do it alone.

93
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,420
It's a team game with more than two people.

94
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
P.S.K.

95
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,420
Help me.

96
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Don't push me.

97
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Let go.

98
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,420
Thank you.

99
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
This year is also here.

101
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Ico Rizaka Shopping Street.

102
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,420
I use paint baby.

103
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,420
If you hit it, you're disqualified.

104
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,420
All the shops are filled with fields.

105
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,420
Let's shoot it all.

106
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,420
Let's clean it up later.

107
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,420
It's a good thing every year.

108
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
It's true.

109
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
I see.

110
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,420
It's also for cleaning the shopping street.

111
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Good plan with money.

112
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Are you in position?

113
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,420
What should I do?

114
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Anyway, it's okay.

115
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Don't shoot your team.

116
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,420
Don't make a fool of me.

117
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
What are they?

118
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
They're amateurs.

119
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
I'll die soon.

120
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Did he shoot now?

121
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Did you say start?

122
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,420
What's going on?

123
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
I don't understand.

124
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,420
This guy.

125
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
It's full of holes.

126
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,420
It's not over yet.

127
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,420
I'll do it.

128
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
I'm sorry, Sakamoto.

130
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,420
Nice shot.

131
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,420
This is the champion's hit.

132
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,420
I can do it.

133
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420
It makes the shop stand out.

134
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,420
It also increases the variation of the ramen.

135
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,420
This is so much fun!

136
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,420
So this is what you call a friend?

137
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
This is great!

138
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,420
I can leave my back to you guys!

139
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,420
He's been recognized as a friend before I knew it.

140
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,420
You guys are really good.

141
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Could it be that you're pros?

142
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,420
He found out!

143
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
You're a faggot, aren't you?

144
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,420
I'm glad I was stupid.

145
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,420
I'll be the decoy and get to the front line.

146
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
I need your help, Proza.

147
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,420
Well, he doesn't look like a bad guy.

148
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Yo!

149
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,420
As expected of the legendary man, Sakamoto!

150
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,420
His shaking body is so cool!

151
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
Sakamoto...

152
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,420
Taro?

153
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,420
No, he's a totally different person!

154
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,420
He's a good-looking guy when he's skinny.

155
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
I like fat guys.

156
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Look, his glasses and hair are exactly the same.

157
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,420
You don't look like him at all, Sakamoto.

158
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Right?

159
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
I hate liars.

160
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
I hate liars.

161
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I hate liars.

162
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
At this timing, what?!

163
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,420
Team Sakamoto Shoten, are you going to be friends with them?!

164
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
I won't forgive you.

165
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,420
I thought you were my friend.

166
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Damn it, you bastard!

167
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,420
You said something unnecessary.

168
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Well, it's okay.

169
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,420
Now I'll get my prize and my certificate.

170
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
I'm full of blood!

171
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm going to die!

172
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Oh!

173
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Team Takoyama is here!

174
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
Nice timing!

175
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Ouch!

176
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Obeshi!

177
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
Come here, Pitch!

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
What?!

179
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,420
I knew it, this is better than the air gun!

180
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
It's real!

181
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
I'll get you!

182
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
This distance...

183
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
With that posture...

184
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
He's aiming at his head!

185
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,420
I can't let him get away with this.

186
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
I'll keep my distance, Pitch!

187
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
Hey, wait!

188
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Kimu!

189
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
First, this way.

190
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
But...

191
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,420
I can't believe there's a target this close.

192
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
I'm really lucky.

193
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
What is it, Bishiki?

194
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
Who's crying, you bastard?

195
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,420
You're not sad at all!

196
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,420
They're my enemies!

197
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
Isn't that right?!

198
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,420
Besides...

199
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,420
This is necessary.

200
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
As a Kuri killer,

201
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
I have to raise the bar!

202
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Now, the tournament is finally in climax!

203
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Which team will win?

204
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,420
He's not around, is he?

205
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
I'll go check on him.

206
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Wait.

207
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Be careful when you're fighting Smurfs.

208
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,420
First, determine where your opponent is.

209
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,420
However, it's important not to let them see where you are.

210
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,520
The

211
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,420
Kuri

212
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
The Kuri

213
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
The Kuri

214
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Joke?

215
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Where did he shoot from?

216
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,420
Did he find out where he was?

217
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
The Kuri

218
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Seriously, Bishiki?

219
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,420
You just got away from me, too?

220
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Are you okay, Sakamoto-san?

221
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,420
You guys are pretty good at dodging.

222
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
You just made a joke, you bastard!

223
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,420
Don't get carried away!

224
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,420
It's not a joke.

225
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,420
That ball had an abnormal number of rotations.

226
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,420
It was probably made with a joke.

227
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
That's amazing.

228
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
You can understand that much?

229
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Yes.

230
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,420
My ball has three rounds.

231
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,420
It's a special type that bounds the ball so that it doesn't read the trajectory.

232
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,420
You said you were friends, but you're full of motivation.

233
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Don't be so naive.

234
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,420
We're killers before we're friends.

235
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,420
If you look at the scope, you can't tell if you're going to hit or miss.

236
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
That's all.

237
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Seriously?

239
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
I can't forgive him!

240
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
He's so stubborn.

241
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,420
I've been taking more than people for a long time.

242
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,420
You really can't do anything, Heisuke.

243
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,420
Even I was able to shoot people for some reason.

244
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,420
I have no choice but to do this.

245
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,420
I'm Heisuke Mashimo, a new employee.

246
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
My specialty is shooting.

247
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,420
I've been shooting all the time since I was in the academy.

248
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,420
I won't lose to anyone if I just shoot.

249
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Thank you.

250
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
What are you talking about?

251
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,420
I don't need a guy who can only do one thing.

252
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,420
You're not picking a new employee.

253
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
What are you doing, Mashimo?

254
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
Can't you handle the knife properly?

255
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
Mashimo!

256
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
I'm not a man!

257
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
I'll kill you!

258
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,420
You're not really good at killing.

259
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,420
You can't help it if you can only shoot.

260
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
Stop it already, you bastard.

261
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,420
I'm not in a good place, so I'm going to quit my job.

262
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm hungry, Heisuke.

263
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,420
Takahashi Sakamoto, a real man.

264
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
I'm going to kill you.

265
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
I'll do it.

266
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,420
I'll prove that I'm a great sniper.

267
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
I'm going to kill you.

268
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,420
I'm going to do this job.

269
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Shut up! Stop talking to yourself!

270
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Did you hear that?

271
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,420
It doesn't matter what others think.

272
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,420
You believe in your own power.

273
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,420
That means you're good enough by yourself.

274
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,420
When people are surprised, their thoughts stand out.

275
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,420
He's good at attacking big men.

276
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
His ears are so sharp.

277
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,420
I'm going to kill you.

278
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,420
A jewel?

279
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
A monster?

280
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,420
I'm not good enough for him.

281
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,420
The battle has been going on for half a day.

282
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,420
It's time to settle the score.

283
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,420
The winner is...

284
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Team Sakamoto!

285
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,420
That's my girl!

286
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,420
I'm a sniper after all.

287
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Damn it!

288
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Don't cry.

289
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Are you really a killer?

290
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Shut up!

291
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Do you know how weak I am?

292
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
Weak?

293
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,420
This is the first time I've fought a great sniper.

294
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,420
I'm not happy about it.

295
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Don't cry!

296
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Here's your prize.

297
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
A car?

298
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
A car?

299
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,420
You're too good for the town.

300
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,420
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,420
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,420
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,420
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,420
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,420
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,420
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,420
I'm sorry.

316
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
I'm sorry.

318
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,420
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
I'm sorry.

320
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,420
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,420
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,420
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
I'm sorry.

339
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
That's too bad.

343
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,400
To think I'll definitely win and lose the prize.

344
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,240
Sorry.

345
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,780
No worry. I'm sure you'll make it.

346
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:33,380
What does the scaring

347
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
that they are talking about

348
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,380
Welcome!

349
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,380
Goal!

350
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
It's 1,063 yen.

351
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
Fukunichi!

352
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to get in trouble.

353
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,380
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to get in trouble.

354
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Excuse me!

355
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
This...

356
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
If you don't mind...

357
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,380
This person is surprisingly pure.

358
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,380
Don't read my heart.

359
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,380
Sasen.

360
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,380
I don't have time now.

361
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
So this is a!?

362
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Papa!?

363
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,380
attained double speed
