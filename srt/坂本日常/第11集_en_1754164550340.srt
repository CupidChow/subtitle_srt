00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The Game of Gambling

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,840
For now, let's split up and increase the number of players.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,300
Well, gambling is all about luck, right?

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,560
No, Uutan is the conciliatory heir of the Lu family.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,840
His name is Bren.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,360
It's hard to imagine that that guy would just play a game of luck.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,560
Exactly.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,920
Gambling is a game of luck, and the game is calculated based on a close psychological game.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
All in.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,640
Unlike you killers, the Mafia world is not as naive as it seems to be.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,560
That guy is playing alone again!

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,440
He's a bad guy, isn't he?

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,600
I shouldn't have taken on this game!

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,200
The same goes for the killers.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,360
Those who leave their lives to luck die.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,000
Try to struggle, you idiots.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,960
The miss is bound to take back your life.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
Give me everything that belongs to you.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you're afraid of the night,

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
ring your fingers and step forward

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now, until it turns red, step on the accelerator

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's not enough, it's still too much

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sure you're standing on your feet

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even if it turns red, swallow your tears

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't even care anymore, look at me

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Jump out, and run to the top

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't even know the rules

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, I can't help thinking about it

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But I'll figure something out if I try

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here you go

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're a child, an amateur

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A turtle is here

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're like a job at a junk shop

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll squeeze your ass

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can hear you, you bastard

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll deal

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Should I just watch for now?

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Call

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Raise 200

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Raise 400

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What are they saying?

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, I found the core

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Did you remember the rules?

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You look like you just pressed it

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why don't you remember?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shut up!

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I left my phone behind, so I can't look it up

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't make me feel embarrassed

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's better if I do it

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I won't let you do it

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're an amateur

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll shoot

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This kid is the ace and king?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey, hey, the straights are all together

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't worry, I'll scare you if you get the bluff

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Boy, I'm sorry, but you can't beat me with that hand

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, I can't stop you if you call

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't use the bluff

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All in

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hey, dealer

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Will you give it to me face-to-face from now on?

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's a lot faster

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who the hell is this?

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's split

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll go in the corner again

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, Dave is here

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
All in red?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's this Dave?

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll take one

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is it

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Dave that Buddha said

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Unfortunately, the place to fall with the electronic magnet is available

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, where is it?

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Go faster

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes, Koarino

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The tough Ants

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
desperate control

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Wutan-sama, they're getting more chips

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Maybe a soldier

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Leave it be

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,560
There's more in the

84
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,000
but

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Plus 1, 0, plus 1, plus 1, plus 1, minus 1, minus 3, plus 1, plus 1, plus 1

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
about four

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What are you going to do?

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hit.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's Blackjack!

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He's unstoppable! That drunkard!

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There it is.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Uutan's special counting.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He remembers all the cards he put in the field in Blackjack.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then predicts the probability of a gun card coming out.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A high-level technique.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will win.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No matter what kind of hand I use.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're smart enough to look down on us!

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The world of the Mafia is all about the power of the hand!

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't like weak people like you, Lu.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a bad omen!

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you okay?

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Huh?

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wow!

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You were my relative!

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't know you were so full of cards!

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why did you let them do that earlier?

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's not just fighting back.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In that case, you should have them do it.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It would be more harmful for them if they were punished later.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a painful excuse.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're...

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're smart!

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Papa told me.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
People always have weapons.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But you don't have to be like them.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Uutan's weapon is his head.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I feel like I've been recognized for the first time.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm fine with myself.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll aim to be better with my own way.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I thought I'd stand next to him someday.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And then I became the Buren of the organization.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The Ryukens have so much grace that they can't be counted.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will definitely eliminate those who threaten the peace of the ojo.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
First, I'll give you 87,630.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Damn.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Same score?

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm glad I didn't lose.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're surprisingly good.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're an idiot.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Can I go home now?

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Wait!

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We don't have a match yet!

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Uutan-sama, if we kill these guys...

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There's no need to fight.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Back off.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But...

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Didn't you hear me?

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I told you to back off.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Fight me and Poker.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Poker?

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know the rules.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't understand them either.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You guys!

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What kind of game is this that you understand?

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, there's a good one!

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's not fair to play three against one.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I'll add two subordinates.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The rules are simple.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The team that has the grandma until the end loses.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So, I'll play a simple game like this.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm so nervous.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I played well with Aoi and the others.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They're so nervous.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Idiot.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
For me, who can read my mind, playing without a grandma is easy.

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll show you a good chance.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Then, let's start.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Who has the grandma?

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The one who's the most anxious.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's you all of a sudden!

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're so obvious.

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're a honest person, miss.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But you're not a low-class person.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This way.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The grandma has been removed.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Miss, please forgive me.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is not a game!

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Now, Hikke.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's your turn.

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Which one should I play?

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Whatever.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's easy if you read your mind.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can read your mind, right?

176
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
People have three kinds of consciousness.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Language-based consciousness,

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Intermediate consciousness,

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and unconsciousness of habits and reflexes.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How far can you read?

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Listen.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If my prediction is correct, you'll lose.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What are you saying?

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're making a fool of yourself.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's obvious.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,300
The

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It'll be bad if the ring is gone.

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hey, pull it out, Dave!

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hurry up?

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But...

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I told you to pull it out...

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I pulled it out and put it back!

193
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Wait!

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What did you just do?

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If you feel any signs of irregularity next time, you're out.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll be waiting for you.

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You're a killer, aren't you?

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You have a poker face.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's a shame.

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're a little bit of a snob, but you've got eyes on me.

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The more you hide, the more you'll be caught in the eye.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Try pulling it out.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is the end!

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Damn it!

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This guy is so evil!

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Sorry.

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're holding it too tight.

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You've changed your mind.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's my turn next.

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey, you guys!

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why did you do that?

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What do you want?

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You came all the way to Japan to be with me.

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This is the limit!

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We're the mafia.

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If you want something, just take it.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You can't do it like that!

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's right!

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're a smart guy!

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He hates you so much.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This is exactly the same as before.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Did I do something useless in the end?

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The mafia's death is no match for the Gekokujo.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Is that all?

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're giving up so easily.

227
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't you want to act cool in front of your favorite girl?

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
U-Pan is smart.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
U-Pan's weapon is his head.

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's right.

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll do it my way.

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't say anything unnecessary, Sakamoto Taro.

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If you shoot, their arms will fly apart.

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Did you think I didn't notice?

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll make sure they explode.

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll leave the rest to you, Sakamoto Taro.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Sakamoto, Sakamoto, Sakamoto Taro!

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You fool.

239
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The bluff is a gamble.

240
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So it was a lie.

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Sakamoto, I lost this match.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I made the bluff dangerous.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't have the right to protect the bluff.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So...

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't know what you're capable of.

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But I know how you feel about protecting your loved one.

247
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I see.

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Sakamoto, as promised,

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm here to prove you wrong.

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Are you listening?

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, we are.

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
U-Pan, move your hands and talk.

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm working because I'm with you.

254
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You look good in an apron.

255
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You want me to work for you, the mafia's conciliatory?

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll work for you. I'll pay you for your work.

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Fine.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Sakamoto, have you heard of Sla?

259
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
A murderer?

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If you know, you'll be quick.

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Please, Sakamoto.

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sure he paid you for the test.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I know that.

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
His name and whereabouts?

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything about Sla.

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Are you serious?

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why did you fight him?

269
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're a liar.

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Listen to me.

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There are many secrets, but I know where he's hiding.

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What do you mean?

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
A few days ago, a murder took place in a prison in Southeast Asia.

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Four of the first-class murderers were killed.

275
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The bodies were burned, and blood was written on the walls.

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Sla killed the murderers?

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Why would he do that?

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
According to the information sources,

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
a strange body has been discovered in Japan recently.

280
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
One has a hole in his whole body.

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
One has a flesh on his whole body.

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
One was torn apart.

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
One was wrapped in a small ball.

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What's that body?

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
These are the dead four murderers' hands.

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sure the dead were killed and then they were exiled.

287
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They're hiding in Japan now.

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Look at that.

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's huge.

290
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Are they foreigners?

291
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sports players? Or martial arts?

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm staring at you.

293
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do you want to get killed?

294
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Japanese manga is interesting.

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Huh?

296
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There was a pickle in there.

297
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I said I was going to get rid of it.

298
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I didn't think Japan would come.

299
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I want to die.

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Japanese hamburgers are so good.

301
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What are you doing?

302
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's wait and see.

303
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Let's read the manga.

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What are you doing?

305
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I asked him to pull it out properly.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But it was in there.

307
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't think it's weird if it's in there.

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're annoying.

309
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's all the same if you crush it.

310
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
My pick-up.

311
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I want to die.

312
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

313
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You're the one who let us escape.

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

315
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Let's talk about work.

316
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I want you to kill the people on this list.

317
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Who are they?

318
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They are harmful to our organization.

319
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It doesn't matter.

320
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I can do whatever I want.

321
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They're all strong.

322
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm going to die.

323
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You're so ugly.

324
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I heard that Japanese people are tough.

325
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But sometimes they're joking.

326
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Are you also harmful to them?

327
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't underestimate the people on that list.

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It will kill you.

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You seem to be serious.

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
If we are careless, we will lose to these devs.

331
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It will take a month to kill them all.

332
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Bring the next list a month later.

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If you don't kill them all, I'll kill the whole country.

334
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Killing is not work.

335
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Killing is life.

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's pure evil.

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's all his decision.

338
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I lost the battle.

339
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I just believe it and see it.

340
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

341
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I wanted to bring her back before that.

342
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You should run away as soon as possible.

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
If we can contact them, we may get information about Sla.

344
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's right.

345
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I want to contact them as soon as possible.

346
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll contact Heisuke.

347
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Didn't you hear me?

348
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They are murderers.

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They are different from the mafia.

350
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
They are dangerous.

351
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can't let them go.

352
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
