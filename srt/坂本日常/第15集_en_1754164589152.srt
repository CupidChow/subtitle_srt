Episode 1

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,000
That bird is the entrance to the shrine of the gods.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For example, you go home after your mission.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You can get the entrance back.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's really sad, isn't it?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But Shishiba-san was eating katsudon.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's your last chance.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Shishiba, I'm tired.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Nagumo, are you eating something?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm on a break from work.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What are you doing?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Did you see the list of the dead?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the last page.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't believe Suraa...

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
...was going to kill the dead.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a bad habit, or a rational one.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think this is their job.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What do you mean?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's getting annoying.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm really sorry!

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm really sorry!

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm truly sorry!

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm really sorry!

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm truly sorry!

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If Suraa ever comes back, all the memories are going to start over.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What are you doing?

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but if you're actually going to work on it,

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,300
if you're actually going to work on it

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,640
now that I think about it

60
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,400
I wasn't that funny

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,120
It was actually pretty fun

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,740
Spins

63
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,020
L bye

64
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,900
!?

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,320
That hon likelihood

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,000
my gun

67
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,720
Take that

68
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
I don't have the right to be with you.

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
You're not going to do it.

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm done for.

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Do you remember the first time you connected with the world?

72
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
What's that?

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,720
The first time I felt like I wasn't alone.

74
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I can clearly remember.

75
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,720
I was a child who couldn't get along with people.

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Alright!

77
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
You're bad at this.

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
I'm home.

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
My mother was so indifferent.

80
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I don't remember much of what we talked about.

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
I don't even remember her voice.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
But...

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Hey, hey, Apart.

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
What's wrong?

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
You're not feeling well.

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Did you eat any of the kikrus?

87
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
My father was kind to me.

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I was too busy with work to see him often.

89
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
But I liked my father.

90
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Listen, Apart.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
People are important.

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Their insides are important.

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,720
If you treat your friends with kindness,

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
they'll notice your charm.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Apart is a good kid.

96
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
First, practice, practice.

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Here, I bought you something nice.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Hello, Apart.

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Be my friend.

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Hey, hey, hey!

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Um...

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I want to join you.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Who are you?

104
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
You're disgusting.

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
I don't understand.

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Why can't they get along?

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Huh? Who are you?

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Dad!

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Dad, welcome home.

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Dad, um...

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
I just...

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm sorry, Apart.

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
It's okay.

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Let's go to the doctor tomorrow.

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
There's no abnormality.

116
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
He's healthy.

117
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
No major injuries were found.

118
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
No abnormality?

119
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
That's impossible.

120
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Then what is it?

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
You're my son.

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
You're not abnormal at all.

123
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
You want to say that you've separated animals?

124
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
My son is a monster even though he was born!

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Dad!

126
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Apart!

127
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
You're disgusting!

128
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Who are you?

129
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm not abnormal.

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
What's this?

132
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Look.

133
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Dad's head is the same as mine.

134
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Mine and Dad's heads are the same.

135
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm glad.

136
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm connected to everyone.

137
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
That's when I realized for the first time.

138
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm not alone.

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
We're all human.

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
This is a confirmation process that makes me feel connected.

141
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
If you want, I can show you the contents.

142
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
No.

143
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,720
If you kill someone, you can only connect.

144
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Don't hurt anyone else anymore.

145
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
You can't deny my way of life.

146
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,720
You're so ungrateful.

147
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
What's this?

148
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Something's not right.

149
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Something's not right!

150
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Stop!

151
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I've decided.

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I'll separate you and make you line up.

153
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
You're not qualified to talk about people's connections.

154
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I'll end it here.

155
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Huh?

156
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Something's...

157
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
It's just...

158
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
It's tilted.

159
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Isn't it dangerous?

160
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
It's dangerous!

161
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
This is bad.

162
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm looking forward to it.

163
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm sure Dad would be happy to know that I'm connected to so many people.

164
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
A wire for a power supply.

165
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I'm glad I'm fat.

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
It's...

167
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Is it going down now?

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm a little tired.

169
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
I was talking to you just now.

170
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Don't look away.

171
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Now, show me the contents.

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
What should I do?

173
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
What's this?

174
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
The End

175
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
What?

176
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Huh?

177
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Did it stop?

178
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,720
It stopped, but it's in a strange shape.

179
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Did Taro do it?

180
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Why?

181
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Maybe it was from before.

182
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Grandpa, are you going to the bathroom?

183
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,720
It sounded like something terrible.

184
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
This is your chance.

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
I'll make you taste my weight.

186
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
What?

187
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Why are you...

188
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Why are you rejecting me?

189
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Why me?

190
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I'm the same human as everyone else.

191
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Why?

192
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Why is it so hard to live?

193
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
The End

194
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
You can change your way of life.

195
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
So...

196
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
I won't let go of this rope.

197
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
The End

198
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
T-The End

199
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Now...

200
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Mission complete.

201
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Thank you!

202
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
The End

203
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Now I can finally talk to her.

204
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh, the tea is gone.

205
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Hey, Lu.

206
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Your leg is broken.

207
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Grandma, can I get a new tea?

208
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
As you wish.

209
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Where am I?

210
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm here.

211
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I was fighting Sakamoto-kun in the tower.

212
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,720
What is this warm table?

213
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
There are so many strangers.

214
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Hey, are you awake?

215
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Don't pretend to sleep with me.

216
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
What are you doing?

217
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Are you also a member of that deer?

218
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm trying to use you.

219
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
It's useless.

220
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I won't take anyone's orders.

221
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Use you?

222
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
No, no.

223
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
That's not it.

224
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
We just want you to help us.

225
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
What do you mean?

226
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Why don't you kill me?

227
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
You should thank Sakamoto-san.

228
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Sit down.

229
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
We don't want to fight you.

230
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,720
We just want information about your landlord.

231
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
That's right.

232
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,720
You're the only one who can rely on us.

233
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,720
We'll do whatever you want, so help us.

234
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm the only one who can rely on you?

235
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Didn't you think I'd attack you if I woke up?

236
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
I don't know.

237
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,720
I just wanted you to change.

238
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
That's all.

239
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
If you get into trouble again,

240
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I'll just hit you with the Sky Tower again.

241
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,720
You were so lucky to get beaten by Taro.

242
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
He's a tough guy, even though he's an enemy.

243
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
If you were serious,

244
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
you would be in that world now.

245
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
You should be thankful.

246
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,720
You're talking to me like a normal person.

247
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
You're strange people.

248
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
What do you want to hear from me?

249
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Oh, thank you!

250
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,720
We met a machine-like human being like a deer.

251
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
People who are tough don't know.

252
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
A machine-like human being like a deer?

253
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
That guy.

254
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Sakamoto, do you know him?

255
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Yeah.

256
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
So? Where did you meet him?

257
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I went to his hotel once.

258
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
I broke up with him because I was too busy.

259
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,720
After that, I put up a thread and listened to the room for a while.

260
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
This is just the right way to get rid of the murder.

261
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,720
I'll make them go wilder.

262
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Then, as planned, we'll go to Phase 2.

263
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Yeah, that's right.

264
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,720
While the Death Police are ordering,

265
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,720
let's destroy their base.

266
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Their goal is to destroy the chain of murder that's become thin.

267
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I think you shouldn't go too deep.

268
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,720
I don't know, but...

269
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,720
The Japanese Murderous Association, known as S.A.R.T.S.L.E.N.

270
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
It consists of more than 1,000 members.

271
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
One of them is a pro-killer with 400 members.

272
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,720
It's the largest killer organization in Japan.

273
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Next!

274
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,720
The reaction of the launchers is too strong to cause jam.

275
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,720
The slide isn't going down.

276
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,720
It's hard to use it in real combat if it doesn't get fixed.

277
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,720
The role of the S.A.R.T.S.L.E.N. Kanto branch is to manage the killer's mission.

278
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,720
A lot of support from the 8,000 members.

279
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Thank you for your request.

280
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
You're asking for a mission, right?

281
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Murder? An accident?

282
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Yes, I'm asking for a murder.

283
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Also, the repair of the general area that was damaged by the mission.

284
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,720
It will take many years to develop and manufacture new weapons.

285
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,720
It's the number of people who are not killed.

286
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,720
And today, the murder case of the Nizou will occur.

287
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
It's huge.

288
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Is this the murder?

289
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
It's not the headquarters.

290
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
He has money.

291
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Where should I park the bike?

292
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,720
If you go in from there, there should be a parking lot in the back.

293
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Excuse me, are you a regular?

294
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,720
This building requires an admission certificate or a company certificate to enter.

295
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,720
No, we're not murderers.

296
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I see.

297
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
So you're an intruder.

298
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Based on the murder case, you will be the target of the assassination.

299
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Boss, do you have a license for murder?

300
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I threw it away because I was bad at taking pictures.

301
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Oh, you suddenly take pictures like that.

302
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
What?

303
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,720
But it's been a long time since I've been in.

304
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
I'm nervous.

305
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,720
It feels like a new semester in the winter break.

306
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
I'm nervous.

307
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
I understand.

308
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,720
I was also a person who was hard to get into the class.

309
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
That's right.

310
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Boss, you have that kind of thing.

311
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm nervous and I'm not good at performance.

312
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,720
I think it's because you're too conscious and careful about your usual actions.

313
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Did you read something again?

314
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Well, let's relax.

315
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Please stop making me nervous.

316
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,720
It's a step towards precious justice.

317
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Killing a murderer?

318
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,720
That's a crazy guy.

319
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,720
What should we do, Sakamoto?

320
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Let's go to the murder case.

321
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
What?

322
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm sorry.

345
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,720
The dream I want to see until it's over

351
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
is still our taste

352
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Oops.

353
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,720
What are you doing on your day off?

354
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Huh?

355
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
I've been playing with Heisuke lately.

356
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Hey.

357
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I went to the game with you the other day and came back from the hot spring.

358
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
You two are close.

359
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
What are you doing on your day off?

360
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Oh.

361
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,720
By the way, I went to the game with Heisuke.

362
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I wanted to play a new zombie game.

363
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
He's really scared.

364
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Mr. Sakamoto.

365
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Thank you for your hard work.

366
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Mr. Sakamoto, what have you been doing on your day off?

367
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Hmm.

368
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I ate a bean paste hot pot with Heisuke yesterday.

369
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
What?

370
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Hmm?

371
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,720
No, we were talking about playing with Heisuke on our day off.

372
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Everyone's playing with Heisuke.

373
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Well, he's basically free.

374
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
