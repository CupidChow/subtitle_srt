00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm so tired from the lab.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ah, Canada, you...

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
The meat is so heavy.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
If we get to the slaughterhouse now, it'll be a bit dangerous.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
We have to go there.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Huh?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Let's all take a bath together!

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
This is...

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
A bathhouse?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm scared of the night.

12
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll put my finger on the trigger.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm still in the mood to get drunk.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's not enough.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm still in the mood to get drunk.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sure I'm standing on the road.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even if I get drunk, I'll drink up my tears.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Don't care about me anymore.

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
Look at me.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Dance!

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, I come for days.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Sakamoto-san, it's dangerous now.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Actually, I don't know much about the fatigue or my abilities.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't know anything.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a top-class job to take a break to always be in the best condition.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Iwabani, this is the last mission!

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Actually, this is my first time coming to the battlefield.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's rare.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The bath is huge!

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Really? That big?

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I wonder if I can swim.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm so excited!

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't overdo it.

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm free on weekdays.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I shouldn't have come back to my parents' house.

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Four adults and one child.

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Yes.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I saw him somewhere.

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I forgot my towel.

41
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Sakamoto-san, did you bring your towel?

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
No.

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Could it be this guy?

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Towel set.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Towel set?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, then...

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
3,300 yen.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Here you go.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wait a moment.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Dad, let's go!

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I knew it.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
The legendary killer, Sakamoto Taro.

53
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Hurry.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I thought I'd never see a killer like him again.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But I didn't expect to see him in my parents' house.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And he's worth 10 billion yen?

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is a chance to raise my salary.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Towel.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Take your time.

60
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm so honored to have a naked date with Sakamoto-san.

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
That's not what I meant.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm so sorry for this.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If I beat the legendary killer,

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll get 10 billion yen.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have no choice.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll do it.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the best!

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm so happy.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm so happy.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm so happy.

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
This is the best!

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
This is so relaxing.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I feel good.

74
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
He's so defenseless.

75
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I can do it. I can do it.

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Sakamoto-san, it's a jet bus.

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Let's go for a ride.

78
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
This is my first time doing this.

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
I feel good.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
I'm a little weak.

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Really?

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I wonder if this is the case.

83
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,500
There are various gimmicks in this bath.

84
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Sakamoto-san!

85
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
It seems to be helpful if you press this.

86
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Die together!

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Damn it!

88
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
This is a jet bus.

89
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
It's so dangerous.

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
It's so cool.

91
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I want to do that.

92
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
When you grow up.

93
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Let's go see the close-up.

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
How is this power?

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
It's so powerful that it can destroy a three-ton truck.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How deep is Sakamoto-san?

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I feel good.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sakamoto-san is so good.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The level of rest is different.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What?

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What kind of a person is he?

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go to the sauna.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sauna?

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sauna?

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Here it comes.

106
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Sakamoto-san is flying.

107
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I'll finish you here.

108
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
It's pretty hot.

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
It's a little low.

110
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Really?

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
It seems to be hot when you pour water here.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Take this!

113
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
The heat is so strong.

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
What a heat!

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
This is a sauna!

116
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
The temperature is so high that natural fires occur.

117
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
It's so hot here.

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
It's perfect.

119
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
What?

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
What a heat!

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is easier than the training of the Kodoshiya period.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's easy, Sakamoto-san.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a little hot here.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Dad, I want to go in there.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When you grow up...

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Did you get in there?

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're young, but you're pathetic.

129
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Oh, a water bath.

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
If the heat is not good, how about the cold?

131
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
What?

132
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,020
Is this a

133
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
little hot?

134
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
It's hot!

135
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
It's hot!

136
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,020
This is a sauna!

137
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
It feels good.

138
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
It's time!

139
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
It's time!

140
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Get ready.

141
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Damn it!

142
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
It feels good.

143
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Why?

144
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Why?

145
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
It feels good.

146
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
It's a long bath.

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Shin is dead.

148
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Dad, buy me ice cream.

149
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
When you grow up...

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Keiichi!

151
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Bye-bye.

152
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Damn it.

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,520
This is the legendary killer Sakamoto Taro.

154
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,520
I can't imagine killing him.

155
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Dad, let's play table tennis.

156
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
You're amazing!

157
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
You're good.

158
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
You too, boss!

159
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I don't want to ride a dead rail.

160
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
I just fell into a trap.

161
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm going to the bath house without Shin.

162
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm going to be a killer.

163
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
I can't be a killer.

164
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm not good at arm wrestling.

165
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Hey, Yutaro!

166
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Yutaro!

167
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,020
I can't believe I'm going to kill Sakamoto.

168
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Hey, Yutaro!

169
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,020
It's been a while.

170
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
Answer me!

171
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
What's wrong with you?

172
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
You're a big guy and you're out of town.

173
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,020
You're going to work at your parents' bath house.

174
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
It's none of your business!

175
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,520
You're so talkative.

176
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Don't make a weird noise.

177
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
You're disgusting.

178
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
You've been so rude for a long time.

179
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
You're...

180
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,520
I can't get a good job.

181
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,520
I think it's a good idea to keep playing this game.

182
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm going to my parents' bath house.

183
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm not going to die!

184
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
You're a loser.

185
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Right, Mocha?

186
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
You're a loser.

187
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Yoko!

188
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
You bastard!

189
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
What did you do to Yoko?

190
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
I didn't do anything!

191
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
You're not crazy!

192
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
You bastard!

193
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
You bastard!

194
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Here.

195
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
You...

196
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
You didn't notice, did you?

197
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm going to kill you.

198
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,020
It was a good reason for the wind to hit you.

199
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
That's all.

200
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
That was so nice!

201
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Let's come again.

202
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
Yeah!

203
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,020
What a pathetic scene.

204
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
There's a limit to how much you can get.

205
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,020
It's been years since I've been praised by people.

206
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,020
And by the legendary killer.

207
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
Hey, Dad.

208
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,020
I'm going to run a shop.

209
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,020
I'm done with the killer.

210
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,020
I know it's impossible for me.

211
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
What?

212
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
It's no good.

213
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
The bugs are too good for me.

214
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
Yeah.

215
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,020
My body is even heavier.

216
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I'm so tired.

217
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
It's so hard.

218
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
You're amazing, Shin-kun.

219
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Is this Japan?

220
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
I hope he's fine.

221
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I have to go pick him up as soon as possible.

222
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,520
I'm so tired.

223
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Look, Shin.

224
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
One is regular cola,

225
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,520
and the other is my special blend cola.

226
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Don't try to read my mind.

227
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I don't know what's special.

228
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
This way.

229
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Here's your treat.

230
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I'm so tired of this.

231
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
It's so much fun to be a family.

232
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
I've never been here before.

233
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
There are families everywhere.

234
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
Really?

235
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,020
My cook cooked for me at home.

236
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Oh, she's the boss's daughter.

237
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Don't you have any old friends?

238
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,020
I like this place.

239
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,520
I don't like the mafia.

240
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,520
I can't go back to the world.

241
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Agreed.

242
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
I know.

243
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,520
I'll enjoy this peace.

244
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I'll take your treat.

245
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Saotau Nira.

246
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Chin-su?

247
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Here's your treat.

249
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Melon soda.

250
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Melon soda at this age?

252
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
It doesn't look like it.

253
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
It doesn't seem to be higher than the bottom.

254
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
What's this?

255
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Are you...

256
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
...Bootan?

257
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Bootan?

258
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
Hello.

259
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,020
I'm here to take care of you.

260
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
Miss.

261
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,020
Bootan, you're alive.

262
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Who are you?

263
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
My brother?

264
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
No!

265
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,020
I'm just a member of the organization.

266
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
Miss.

267
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,520
Since that incident,

268
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,020
the Lu family has been in debt.

269
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Hey, don't ignore me.

270
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,020
I'd like you to come back as a debtor.

271
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,520
You're not a killer like me.

272
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
What?

273
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
No!

274
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I'm not in the mafia world anymore.

275
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,520
I don't care if someone wants to invest.

276
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Cute!

277
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Miss. Bootan, are you okay?

278
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Don't cry.

279
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Stay still.

280
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
What's this?

281
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,520
This is Lu Bootan.

282
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Miss.

283
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I don't know why, but

284
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
he's been getting more and more obsessed with it.

285
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
The perverted, clumsy Consilieri.

286
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Miss.

287
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Consilieri?

288
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
The mafia's advisor.

289
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Miss, you must have noticed

290
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,520
that I was protecting you.

291
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
This guy is dangerous.

292
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Anyway, I'm out of the mafia world.

293
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,020
I'm just a member of the Sakamoto Shoten.

294
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
I see.

295
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,020
So, to bring back Miss,

296
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
you're the legendary killer,

297
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
Takamototaro.

298
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,020
So, you're the one who's in the way.

299
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
I don't know, but

300
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
if you insist, I'll be your opponent.

301
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Idiot!

302
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,020
You can't fight a killer with your bare hands!

303
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
What?

304
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
It's refreshing.

305
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
I'll have you guys

306
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,020
fight the mafia with your own hands!

307
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,520
No way!

308
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
It's faster to just beat them.

309
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I want to end this quickly.

310
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Don't worry.

311
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
I have something to tell you guys.

312
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Sakamoto.

313
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
If you win this match,

314
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
I'll give you information about a person

315
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
who put a check on you.

316
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Why do you know?

317
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Don't underestimate the information of the mafia.

318
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Sakamoto-san.

319
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
I refuse.

320
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
I won't do it.

321
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,020
I'll find the information myself.

322
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
What?

323
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,020
I'm in for it.

324
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,020
You!

325
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,020
If you lose, you'll go back to the mafia world!

326
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
I know.

327
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,020
But, I'm just a member of the Sakamoto Shoten.

328
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Then, I'll do my best for the manager!

329
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,020
Then, follow me.

330
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,020
You're going to take off your clothes?

331
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,020
What a ridiculous sound.

332
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,520
It's dirty.

333
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Where are you taking me?

334
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Shut up and follow me.

335
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
What's with the match of the mafia?

336
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I want to go home.

337
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Hey, you two poor people.

338
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
From now on, you'll be seen in your lowly clothes.

339
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I prepared it specially for you, so change.

340
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Please change here.

341
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Perfect.

342
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Come in.

343
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
This is the place where the people of the underworld live.

344
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Where greed and money are mixed.

345
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
It's Urakajino.

346
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Kajino?

347
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I see.

348
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
It's true.

349
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
If it's this, I can't win.

350
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I see.

352
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
It's true.

353
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
It doesn't matter if it's this or not.

354
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
I prepared a chip for you, the poor people.

355
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,520
I prepared a chip for you, the poor people.

356
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,520
The one who earns more money within the time limit is the winner.

357
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Then, let's meet here in two hours.

358
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Here.

359
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Campbell.

360
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Don't worry, Rue.

361
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I have a heart that can read the mind.

362
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
I see.

363
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
That's right.

364
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,520
If we can see the heart of the dealer and the customer, we can't lose.

365
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,520
I don't know the rules of the Kajino game at all.

366
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Me too.

367
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
What?

368
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
That's bad.

369
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Wutan is weak in combat, but he's actually quite good at it.

370
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,520
It's a rare case that he's the only one who can beat Campbell in the martial arts world.

371
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Wow!

372
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,520
That drunkard won all-in all of a sudden.

373
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,520
That means he's got 90 million.

374
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
That's three times more.

375
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,520
I will definitely take back the queen.

376
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
I bet everything on it.

377
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,520
To be continued...

378
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
To be continued...

379
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
To be continued...

380
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
To be continued...

381
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Damn!

382
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,520
The food is gone because of Sakamoto and the others!

383
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Tanaka, let's open a crepe shop.

384
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Crepe shop?

385
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Okay! Let's do it!

386
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,520
This is a letter from the pen name, Unko-chan.

387
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
There's no one here.

388
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
This is a letter from the radio name, Unko-chan.

389
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Unko-chan.

390
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Seba-chan!

391
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I've only been listening to the radio.

392
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
You must be hungry.

393
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
It's so good!

394
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I wanted to try it once.

395
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Look!

396
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
There's crepe!

397
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Do you want to buy it?

398
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I want to buy it!

399
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Pink head!

400
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
It's hot!

401
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I want to try it too!

402
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Look!

403
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
There's crepe!

404
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Amazing!

405
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
It's a popular crepe.

406
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
It's very popular.

407
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
There's a trick to it.

408
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
It's okay if you don't win.

409
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
That's strange.

410
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm sorry.
