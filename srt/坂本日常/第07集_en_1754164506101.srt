00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Episode 2

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Yes, yes, yes!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Then, Hana-chan.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Yes!

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
I'm glad we asked for a fake version of Shin-kun and the others.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I wonder if they're doing well.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's okay. Probably.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Hey, Rui!

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Stop using my apron when you're doing dirty work!

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Geez, you're such a fine-tuned man!

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then, why don't you clean up after me?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
Why?!

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,500
I'll be honest with you!

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Right now, Sakamoto-san and Aoi-san are in a bad spot!

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm the one who's at the top here!

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Yes, yes, I'm glad.

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Sometimes, Shin is like a kid.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Hey, if you have something to say, let's be honest.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
You're just a lazy man, your thoughts.

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
You're free to think!

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
You're the one who's stepping into my heart!

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Hey!

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,000
I came to get some meat buns for my exhaustive energy today!

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're reading people's thoughts and doing perverted work!

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You perverted, blond, and perverted man!

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Shut up, you drunk-dol-e-a-pron-thief!

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I feel like I'm being read by you, but I can't calm down!

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,000
I see.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Huh?

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey, hey.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,500
Are you sure you want to go?

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know!

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can I eat this?

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're going out too.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm getting all flustered.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I've never seen this face before.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're already back.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you're in a hurry, I'll forgive you.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
It's this guy.

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Come with me.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No topic to talk about.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They worked hard the whole school.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But it looks ridiculous.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I really need to wish them up.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's my concern, too.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Have you heard of American people?

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's Packet Man.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Packets Man?

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Black Pants.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No way! It says on the name card that it's true!

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't screw me!

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, sir.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But why did you pick up on this?

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, I don't know the details.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
See, Love was doing experiments on superpowers, right?

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's the only successful one.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It seems that he can read people's thoughts.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're so mean!

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're just thinking about what you're thinking!

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't think I want to be with someone like that.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sure no one will like me.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're a miserable guy.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mr. Tomoka!

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If you listen to me, you'll see that Shin is stupid, serious, and a brat.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But he's a better guy than you!

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Besides, there's something different about him.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not just about being miserable.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wait, what's your name?

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm Boo Shouter.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's why I told you.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't listen to people, do you, Tanaka?

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can't help it.

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm the one who's going to be responsible for this.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hey, El. If you're going to apologize, forgive me.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Huh? Sabori again?

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm home!

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mr. Sakamoto!

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What happened?

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So when I came back, Lou...

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We're on our way to the south.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mr. Sakamoto, what's that?

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That name tag.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
GPS function.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You idiots!

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're going to get killed for sure!

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sure of it.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Get off the highway, you jerk!

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's 15 kilometers away from the exit.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Damn it! That's why I hate working on site!

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I should just make him my boss.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll just make him say he's out of superpowers.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You'll find out if you're not a good person.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Damn it!

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm an idiot.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I got punished for saying something terrible to Shin.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not going to let you get away with this!

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I didn't mean to do that.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just wanted to apologize.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Give me back my daughter.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Shin!

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Boss!

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What? Is that the real Shin?

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I got a picture!

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's good.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to get killed even if I go back to the lab!

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Are they lab people?

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm counting on you!

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, you little jerk!

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Get to sleep!

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Can I have some tea?

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Sure, bring it!

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Damn it!

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're good!

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're good at photography!

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah!

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What are they?

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a mess!

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Are they all dead?

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It looks like it.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm done with this!

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You'd better apologize before you get hurt!

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a mess!

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'd rather go home in the dark.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm scared!

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If you're done with this...

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Are you okay?

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey!

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It hurts!

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Shin!

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, I understand.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll leave the order to you.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sure this is a special one.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I won't be easy on you if you come.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm counting on you, Seba!

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey!

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's tough to have a bad boss.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Huh?

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Be careful, Sakamoto!

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wow, you're a good guy.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm scared!

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let me go!

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sakamoto!

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I thought you'd die, the legendary killer.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hey, did you catch Shin?

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, I forgot.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Seba!

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Damn, the bike's broken.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The GPS signal stopped on the way.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Who are they?

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Probably a member of the lab.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Lab?

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Lab?

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's where I grew up in the government's secret organization.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But...

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a group of weirdos,

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
but it wasn't this ugly before.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's going on?

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why is that?

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going to get back at Lou.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The Lab

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So this is the lab.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We're trying to keep it from getting out.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The lab is hiding in this basement.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's been a while since you've been back in town.

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The Lab

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's a lot of people.

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a normal lab.

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Welcome!

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
To the Octave Science Lab where you can learn about nature and science.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How about a picture?

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't say that.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not interested in pictures.

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm not interested!

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm not interested!

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A dinosaur pose!

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The big size will be 4,900 yen.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
One picture, please.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's perfect for hiding your face.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's good for your skin.

222
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This way.

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There's a secret passageway to the lab.

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Come with your family next time.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're not going to get away!

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't be so loud!

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What is this place?

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Mr. Tanaka.

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is that the boy with the same special ability as you?

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He looks different in color and gender.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But if you lie to Mr. Tanaka...

234
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll kill you.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What is this guy?

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
His face is covered in thorns.

238
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's creepy.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Boss, can I talk to you for a minute?

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes, Mr. Isseba.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This is a frog ball, but I have a real heart.

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Mr. Isseba!

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Damn it!

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to die!

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have to catch that boy.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
To meet his expectations.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm counting on you, Mr. Isseba.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes, I'll do my best.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know if I remember.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think I should meet him at 8.20.

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think I should bend his head 90 degrees to the left.

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Beji Ngr strong at putting things like this first.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,460
OK, I'm sure.

255
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,000
Is it ProduceX?

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hmm.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If I broke the leaderboard, it would have been a deal.

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,460
Oh, yes.

259
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,960
It's an annoying trick.

260
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Doctor B.

261
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,760
You can'telfi rvate.

262
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,960
More different than usual.

263
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,100
First attempt failed.

264
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Next, the second attempt.

265
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,180
Sakamoto, have you ever fought a real bear?

266
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,720
I trained animals one by one.

267
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,020
First phase, system down.

268
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,660
Moving on to the second phase.

269
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
The third phase, system down.

270
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
First attempt failed.

271
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,920
This is the first time for a dinosaur.

272
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
What? What do we do about this?

273
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
A moving dinosaur?

274
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Wow!

275
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
It's so cute!

276
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I want to show it to the flowers.

277
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
What?

278
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,920
I'll make it a chicken. Don't hurt it too much.

279
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
What are you thinking about?

280
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
The tail is in trouble.

281
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
There's an electronic device on its head.

282
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,880
If it's an electric gun, it might be able to stop it without getting hurt.

283
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
It's a miracle, Jim.

284
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Oh, no!

285
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
It's working!

286
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
System restart.

287
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Intercept level, max.

288
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Sakamoto!

289
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Sakamoto!

290
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
The gun!

291
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,840
This is getting troublesome.

292
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
I can't let you get away with this.

293
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I can't let you get away with this.

294
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
No!

295
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
The dinosaur won't move, so there's a romance.

296
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Is that so?

297
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
The sound stopped.

298
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
What was that?

299
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Did the security at the entrance work?

300
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Hey, you damn scientists!

301
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
What are you doing?

302
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Let me rest for a while.

303
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I haven't slept for three days.

304
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
If you want to be released, you have to hurry.

305
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm going to the hospital.

306
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,760
If you want to be released, you have to hurry.

307
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
You stupid scientists!

308
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Mr. Ishikawa!

309
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Do you really think this research will work?

310
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
This research?

311
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,760
You just said something you shouldn't have said.

312
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
You're a traitor to the organization.

313
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Die!

314
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
What's going on?

315
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Shin!

316
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
It's Shin.

317
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
He's back?

318
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
He's out on a business trip.

319
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Where's that guy?

320
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
The president is in the lower class.

321
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
The lab is being occupied by a certain group of killers.

322
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
A group of killers?

323
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
About a year ago.

324
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I don't know what they're doing.

325
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
They're trying to kill us.

326
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
They're trying to kill us.

327
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
About a year ago, they suddenly appeared.

328
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Nice to meet you.

329
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm a killer.

330
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
My name is Kashima.

331
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,680
We are looking for more innovative killing tools.

332
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Guns and knives are old.

333
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,680
We should also include the latest technology in killing.

334
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,680
So we would like to borrow your brains.

335
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
They are based on the boss Kashima.

336
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,640
They are composed of a few executives and a few men.

337
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
That's it?

338
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Sakamoto, you're going to kill them and find the Rue?

339
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,640
I'm going to fight them.

340
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
What are you saying?

341
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
You should run away.

342
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,640
The executives who are in charge of this floor...

343
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
They're here. Hide.

344
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Don't run away.

345
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I don't want to be a killer.

346
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Let me out.

347
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Shut up.

348
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
That's terrible.

349
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
What a crazy woman.

350
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
What are you doing?

351
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You'll see.

352
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm escaping.

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
You're so loud.

354
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
That's right.

355
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,560
You should stop.

356
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Who is he?

357
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,560
He's the chief of the department.

358
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,560
You guys want to escape with me?

359
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
It's noisy.

360
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Are you having fun?

361
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,520
I'll help you.

362
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
No, thanks.

363
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Ballpoint pen.

364
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Let me in.

365
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Liar.

366
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
That bastard.

367
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
I'm in trouble.

368
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
The subordinate was on the front.

369
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,520
You're hiding something, aren't you?

370
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Who's going to talk first?

371
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Give me the ballpoint pen.

372
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
See?

373
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,480
You're a good man.

374
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Why did you come out?

375
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Nothing.

376
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,480
I don't like small places.

377
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Shin.

378
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,440
What should I do?

379
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Are you going to get in our way?

380
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
No.

381
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,440
This is a great study.

382
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I'll show you now.

383
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
The fun experiment has begun.

385
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm sorry.

386
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,360
You're a good man.

387
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,360
The switch that turns words upside down.

388
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,360
The current from the needle in the head.

389
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,360
It's driving the brain crazy.

390
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Thank you.

391
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Next.

393
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm finally out.

394
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Thank you.

395
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
It looks fun.

396
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Shin.

398
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,360
I don't know what happened in the past.

399
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Do you want to help?

400
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
No.

401
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Let's go to the big cleaning of the house.

402
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
No.

403
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
It's been a long time since I took a bus.

404
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
I'm hungry.

405
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Let's eat this.

406
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,360
You're a good man.

407
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Does this have anything to do with the solar system?

408
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,360
I can't find any information about the cloud.

409
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Including the study.

410
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Let's go.

411
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:05,360
One holy day

412
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Hey, hey, hey, somebody help us

413
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,400

Hey, somebody help us

418
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Hey, somebody help us

419
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Somebody help us
